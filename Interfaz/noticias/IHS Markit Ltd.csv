0;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-03-27T04:00:45Z;OJ pips all other commodities as consumers seek vitamin boost;Coronavirus outbreak has driven demand for the restorative properties of orange juice;Consumers fearful of contracting coronavirus have been seeking to boost their immune systems the old-fashioned way: by loading up on orange juice.Frozen concentrated orange juice, traded in New York, is the best performing of all commodities this year, according to Bloomberg data, rising 25 per cent to $1.214 a pound since the start of January. US shoppers have rushed to stock up on the shelf staple, analysts said, while fears over labour shortages in factories and transportation have also given prices a lift.“There is plenty of orange juice around, but it’s a bit like toilet paper — there’s no shortage but people have been rushing to buy it,” said Neil Murray at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence. Jack Scoville at commodity brokers Price Futures Group in Chicago, said prices had been supported by worries over glitches in supply chains. “Traders are wondering if workers are around to man the plants in Florida and in Brazil. In addition, there are not enough tankers or containers around for shipping the product to buyers,” he said.The jump in orange juice prices comes even as the market has been languishing amid a rise in production in Brazil, the largest producer and exporter, and Florida, said IHS. On the demand side, too, consumption has been waning over the past few years as shoppers switch to water and other drinks with lower sugar contents.Arabica, the high-grade coffee bean, has also experienced a sharp upswing, up 24 per cent from a week ago to $1.277 a pound in New York. The commodity had sold off during the early stages of the viral outbreak, on concerns of falling demand in cafés and coffee chains, but analysts said the focus had now turned to securing supplies in the face of rising logistical risks. “Everyone in the supply chain is trying to get their hands on stock,” said Carlos Mera, an analyst at Rabobank, noting strong demand from importers and roasters.Retail demand has been solid, too. In the UK, for example, consumers have turned from cafés to retailers to fuel their caffeine addiction, buying coffee and beans from stores. In the week to March 14, retail sales were up 30 per cent compared with the same period last year and up 8 per cent over the previous week, according to Nielsen data. Wholesale coffee buyers have been spooked by calls among port workers in Brazil, the largest producer and exporter of coffee beans, to close ports. While this has yet to materialise, companies and importers were stocking up in case the flow of coffee dries up, analysts said.Prior to the current price volatility, there had been concerns about overall supplies of coffee beans, especially in Central America, following several years of low prices. The threat of low levels of coffee in storage among exporters and producers had been supporting spot prices of beans, despite weakness in the futures market.

While German activity rose above expectations, this was offset by weaker data from France, which has been hit by nationwide strikes for several weeks.By remaining only slightly above the crucial level of 50, below which the majority of companies surveyed are reporting a shrinking of activity, the PMI data underline the weak position of the eurozone economy.“While the year may have changed, the performance of the eurozone economy was a familiar one in January,” said Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit. “Output growth was unchanged from the modest pace seen in December, signalling that the economy failed again to record a pick-up in growth momentum.”The eurozone economy has slowed sharply in recent months and the European Central Bank recently forecast that growth last year would be 1.2 per cent — down from 1.8 per cent the previous year and 2.4 per cent in 2017.The signing of a phase one trade agreement between Washington and Beijing this month has boosted hopes of an easing of trade tensions that have been weighing on Europe’s export-dependent manufacturing sector.But the US continues to threaten to impose extra tariffs on European goods in retaliation for a tax on technology companies, which is feeding anxiety that Europe could be the next frontline in the battle over trade.The index for the eurozone’s services sector fell to 52.2, down from 52.8 in December. Economists had expected it to increase. Meanwhile, the index for manufacturing in the eurozone increased to a five-month high of 47.8, up from 46.3 last month and well ahead of expectations, albeit still below the level of 50 that indicates solid growth.“The big picture for the eurozone remains of an economy with subdued underlying growth, around 0.2 to 0.3 per cent per quarter at the start of this year, in line with the growth rates seen in the second half of 2019, and a still fragile manufacturing sector,” said Nicola Nobile, lead economist at Oxford Economics.The data published on Friday presented a contrasting picture between Germany and France, as the eurozone’s two biggest economies diverged at the start of the year.German PMI rebounded ahead of expectations to a five-month high of 51.1 in January as the country started to shake off the long slump in its manufacturing sector that has weighed on growth for two years.But French PMI dipped to a four-month low of 51.1, highlighting how public sector strikes that have disrupted the country for several weeks have taken their toll on the economy.The survey results indicate a reversal of fortunes for the two biggest economies in the eurozone. France grew at a faster rate than Germany for much of last year, boosted by tax cuts and increased public spending as well as its lower reliance on exports.IHS Markit said growth in the eurozone outside Germany and France slowed to a six-and-a-half year low, pointing to weakness in Spain and Italy in particular.The European Central Bank published the results of its quarterly survey of professional forecasters, which showed that they had on average cut their forecast for eurozone growth this year from 1.1 to 1 per cent, while increasing it slightly for next year from 1.2 to 1.3 per cent.
2;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-12-16T10:13:19Z;Manufacturers glum as business activity slows sharply;Most companies report falling output with December below expectations;UK businesses were at their gloomiest since the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum in the run-up to last week’s election, with political uncertainty compounding the lack of clarity over Brexit and the drag from weaker global growth.The “flash” index of activity published by the research group IHS Markit, based on around 85 per cent of replies to its monthly surveys, fell from 49.3 in November to 48.5 in December, below analysts’ expectations and the lowest reading since July 2016. Any reading under 50 indicates a majority of businesses reporting falling output.The data add to evidence of a dismal end to the year for the UK economy, with official figures showing growth stagnating in the three months to October, inflation well below the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target and the labour market flagging.Samuel Tombs, at the consultancy Pantheon Economics, said that “on past form”, the reading was consistent with UK output contracting 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year. However, he added that the surveys had overplayed the impact of political uncertainty on economic activity in recent months.Manufacturers were especially downbeat. They have been reporting an accelerating decline in incoming new work since May but many also said that the effects of weaker export sales had been exacerbated by customers destocking and putting spending decisions on hold until after the election.Service sector businesses, which make up 80 per cent of the economy, were less gloomy, with the volume of incoming work starting to stabilise. But a small majority still reported falling output.In both sectors, a majority of businesses said they were cutting staff.“The underlying message is that the manufacturing sector is very sick . . . In contrast, there are signs that the worst may be over for the services sector,” said Thomas Pugh, at the consultancy Capital Economics.However, the real question for policymakers is whether business confidence will pick up, now that the election result offers a prospect of greater clarity on Brexit and potentially a boost to growth from higher government spending.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the main drag on order books was falling export sales, with overseas demand for UK goods and services suffering the worst slump since at least 2014. But he added that future expectations had risen to their highest level since June, reflecting “hope that the election will . . . remove some of the uncertainty that has been holding back demand”.The BoE’s monetary policy committee is unlikely to change interest rates when it meets this week, but analysts said that if business sentiment did not improve early in the new year more of the committee’s members could join the two dissenters who voted for a rate cut in November.Data for the survey was collected in the week leading up to the vote. Mr Pugh said a Brexit deal and a potential fiscal loosening could boost sentiment early in the new year — but that if this did not materialise, the Bank of England “may decide to help out by cutting interest rates”.
3;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-12-06T19:10:01Z;Facial recognition: how China cornered the surveillance market;Its companies dominate but a clutch of rivals are looking to close the technology gap on Beijing;What do Uganda’s police force, a prison in Inner Mongolia and Zimbabwean airports have in common? All three are in the process of testing facial recognition systems and all three have used Chinese technology to do it. At least 52 governments are doing the same thing according to research by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Chinese facial recognition companies have taken the lead in serving this growing international market not least because of the advantage they have over peers in other countries: a massive domestic market and an authoritarian system where privacy often takes a back seat. According to IHS Markit, China accounted for nearly half of the global facial recognition business in 2018.“There are protests around the world from Lebanon to Chile and Iraq, and a lot of these governments, whether it’s liberal democracies or more autocratic, are in tenuous positions,” says Steven Feldstein, a fellow at Carnegie, a US think-tank. “Now, there is technology available that allows them to fight back against political mobilisation.”Critics, and human rights campaigners, have accused Beijing and the surveillance companies of “exporting authoritarianism” via the technology that has been used at home as part of a security crackdown that has led to the detention of more than 1.8m people, predominantly Uighur Muslims, in the Xinjiang region.Chinese companies may be the most successful, but they are not the only ones supplying surveillance technologies to governments. Rivals from Israel, Japan and America are competing to do the same, while often sourcing components from the US.Research by Mr Feldstein into the global expansion of artificial intelligence surveillance found that Chinese tech companies — particularly Hikvision, the world’s biggest surveillance camera vendor, Huawei, Dahua, and ZTE — have supplied countries ranging from Australia to Myanmar and Kazakhstan.“These companies are particularly well-suited to provide [advanced surveillance capabilities],” says Mr Feldstein, “but also they are willing to go to markets that perhaps western competitors are less willing to go to.”On the roads leading into Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, surveillance cameras flash at every car passing in and out of the perimeter of the urban centre, capturing and analysing the identities of their occupants. Chinese telecoms company Huawei boasts that its cameras led to a 46 per cent drop in the regional crime rate in 2015. Local government figures suggest the impact was smaller, and only shortlived.The company, which was blacklisted for allegedly posing a threat to US national security this year, has supplied surveillance equipment — including facial recognition — to roughly 230 cities worldwide stretching from western Europe to large swaths of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It supplies more countries with AI video surveillance than anyone else according to Carnegie.“Huawei has been investing heavily in the developing world in a way their telecoms provider competitors haven’t. It is perfectly pitched for surveillance projects,” says Henry Tugendhat, a researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “The governments have an interest in security and companies have an interest in selling.”But the question of who is driving the surveillance rollout is not straightforward. “I would beware of the idea that Africa is a blank slate, where the Chinese arrive bringing their oppressive ways,” says Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet. “Companies are spinning their products to fit the political demands of African elites.”Hikvision, which grew out of a government research institute, but is now only partially state-owned, has a growing international presence, supplying video surveillance infrastructure from Brazil to South Africa and Italy. It is one of a clutch of Chinese tech companies — along with Dahua, SenseTime and Megvii, among the world’s leading artificial-intelligence software vendors — to have been blacklisted by Washington over alleged involvement in supplying technology used in Xinjiang.Yet Chinese domination of the market shows no sign of waning. According to figures from IHS Markit China’s market expanded by 13.5 per cent last year whereas the global market — excluding China — grew by just 5 per cent. In 2017 Chinese state media boasted that the country had built the world’s biggest video surveillance system, employing over 20m AI-enabled cameras.Chinese companies have previously operated under loose regulation at home and abroad, but are now facing challenges from the public unhappy at the expansion of facial recognition. Some 80 per cent of respondents in the country’s first mass survey on the issue, released on Thursday, feared data leaks from facial recognition operators.“When you’re arguing with public bodies like the Beijing subway about their use of facial recognition, there’s no point talking to them about data protection,” Hong Yanqing, a scholar at Peking University, told a recent forum in Beijing. “Instead we need to have a debate about the appropriateness and proportionality of using [facial recognition].”Mr Hong helped draft the government working group’s report on personal data protection standards.The widespread use of facial recognition in China is in part a reflection of how many activities already require real-name identification. Face scans have replaced or augmented human identity checks in hotels, boarding flights and trains, and at banks and hospitals. Regulations, which came into effect this week, require telecom carriers to scan the faces of users registering for mobile phone services.But facial recognition is also being used to extend surveillance in new ways, such as tracking the classroom behaviour of students. The country’s rapidly expanding network of facial-recognition cameras means many people are now subject to mass identification. China’s police force already holds the world’s biggest national database of over 1bn faces, captured for the national ID card system. Depending on the quality of these photos, they can be matched to people posing for a face scan.The industry is beginning to pay attention to the complaints. SenseTime announced last week that it will lead a consortium of 27 companies to help set national standards for facial recognition, under the guidance of a government standards body. “The public is increasingly paying attention to the security problems faced by this technology,” the company wrote in a social media post.While debate over the use of facial recognition in the EU and the US is focused on the privacy threat of governments or companies identifying and tracking people, the debate in China is often framed around the threat of leaks to third parties, rather than abuses by the operators themselves.China’s courts received their first challenge to the commercial use of face scans in October. When a zoo in Hangzhou forced season pass holders to submit to face scans for entrance, Guo Bin, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, sued the zoo in order to keep his personal information private. Face traits are “sensitive personal data”, he said in a court submission, arguing that the data could be leaked or stolen.Most Chinese people approve of the use of facial recognition for convenience and improving security, but remain concerned about privacy abuses, according to Beijing’s Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Centre, which conducted the mass survey.The installation of an in-class facial monitoring system at the China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing in September sparked widespread online criticism. As part of a new “smart campus” system, the school installed face scanners in two classrooms to track attendance and to catch students dozing, playing on their phones and talking in class. It “effectively solves the difficult problems of managing attendance and low efficiency”, the school says.In response, China’s education ministry said the department would add restrictions and regulations on the use of facial recognition in schools, and hoped they would be “highly cautious” in using the technology.While Chinese companies are dominant in the global facial recognition market, their position is coming under pressure from rivals such as Japan’s NEC which supplies similar technology in 14 countries, and US groups like IBM, the software company Palantir and Cisco.“Companies from other countries including Israel and Russia are very advanced in this space, and are making a play in markets such as the United States, and regions in the Caucasus and Central Asia, which is significantly under-reported,” Mr Feldstein says.Israeli companies like AnyVision and Elbit Systems have supplied technology to the US, while Ukrainian start-up Riddletag uses Amazon’s facial recognition technology to allow access to passengers in the Tbilisi subway in Georgia.“US companies, for all the lip service they pay to technology and ethics, are also building surveillance tech, and indeed supplying Chinese companies that produce it,” says Stephanie Hare, an independent researcher of facial recognition technology and ethics, and a former employee of Palantir. “This leaves everyone else with a decision: be spied on by the US or by China? This point was made in the German parliament last week, and the US was very upset about it, saying there can be no moral equivalence between China’s authoritarianism and US values.”Meanwhile, China’s surveillance industry is already moving on to the next frontier of computer image recognition: identifying people by the way they walk and trying to read their emotions.Additional reporting by Nian Liu and Ryan McMorrow in BeijingThis article has been amended to refer to a prison in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia
4;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-09-24T23:01:23Z;IHS Markit launches global carbon index;The price of carbon credits has surged as governments launch trading schemes;Data provider IHS Markit has created its first global carbon index, allowing investors to gain exposure to the US and European markets for carbon credits at a time when policymakers are paying increasing attention to the challenges of climate change.The IHS Markit Global Carbon index, launched on Wednesday, combines the performance of the world’s three most liquid markets for carbon credit futures: the European Union Allowance programme, and in the US the California Carbon Allowance scheme and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. It provides a weighted average price for a carbon credit — just shy of $24 on Monday’s close.Authorities issue carbon credits to companies, often industrial or power firms, to keep a handle on pollution. Businesses can buy more credits, and sell any surplus, on the secondary market. One carbon credit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide that the holder is allowed to emit.The IHS Markit index, which is available publicly online, also shines a light on how lucrative carbon credits can be. An investor who bought in on January 1 2018 would now be enjoying a rise of about 133 per cent, far outstripping global equity markets.The price of one credit traded through the EU’s system, which is the world’s first and largest carbon trading scheme, surged from about €5 a credit in 2013 to nearly €30 in July, due in large part to sweeping regulatory measures and an incremental reduction of available credits. It has since fallen back to about €26.Other carbon trading markets will be granted entry to IHS Markit’s index as long as they meet a “hard asset test”, where $10m worth of credits are traded monthly. “In terms of China or other markets entering, that is something we expect to happen as the market grows,” said Nicholas Godec, index product manager at IHS Markit.China’s emission trading scheme is due to launch next year. Latin American countries including Mexico are also considering launching their own systems. The total market for carbon credits was worth $82bn in 2018, according to the World Bank.Nicolas Girod, managing director at carbon consultancy ClearBlue Markets, said: “The performance of the carbon market has been pretty strong, mainly driven by regulatory changes . . . The sentiment towards carbon has become much more positive.”He added that investors had been interested by carbon’s lack of correlation to other asset classes such as stocks or commodities.But the carbon market is exposed to a degree of political risk. Last month, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit led to speculators increasing bets that the price of carbon would fall, if it caused UK companies to dump their credits.Mr Godec remains optimistic. “As long as there’s economic growth we expect this market to continue to expand.”
5;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-06-05T09:18:27Z;UK services activity picks up but remains ‘muted’ — survey;Overall economic activity subdued, executives say;Activity in the sprawling UK services sector accelerated in May, but remained “muted,” according to a survey of industry executives that followed gloomy reports on the manufacturing and construction industries. The IHS Markit purchasing managers’ index for services rose to 51 in May, from 50.4 in April — slightly higher than forecast by a Reuters poll of economists. A reading above 50 indicates that a majority of businesses report increased activity.The pick-up in services activity was supported by greater intake of new business, higher staffing levels and increased optimism. But Brexit related uncertainty continued to weigh on business and consumer spending, according to the survey. Despite the uptick in services activity in May, the average for the sector so far in 2019 is 50.3, down from the 2018 average of 53, sharpening fears for the health of a sector that accounts for about 80 per cent of UK economic output.“All in all, the sector is still suffering a potent cocktail of depressed demand and uncertainty,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.As well as subdued growth in activity, services are facing rising staff wages, and increased transport and input costs as a result of a weaker sterling.The improvement in the sector’s activity in May was offset by a deterioration in the manufacturing and construction PMI indices, which both dropped below the 50 mark. The composite reading, which includes manufacturing and construction, dropped marginally to 50.7 in May, from 50.9 in April. “Although service sector business activity gained a little momentum in May, with growth reaching a three-month high, the pace of expansion remained disappointingly muted and failed to offset a marked deterioration in manufacturing performance and a fall in output of the construction industry during the month,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.“The PMI surveys collectively indicated that the UK economy remained close to stagnation midway through the second quarter as a result, registering one of the weakest performances since 2012,” he added.According to Samuel Tombs, chief UK Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, the PMI surveys point to a lack of economic growth in the second quarter, after a 0.5 per cent expansion in the first quarter.Although Britain’s central bank has said that “the relationship between survey responses and GDP growth may be weaker at times of high uncertainty”, the overall weakness of the May purchasing managers’ surveys “reinforces belief that the Bank of England will maintain a cautious ‘wait and see’ approach on interest rates amid heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties”, said Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor at EY ITEM Club, a consultancy. 
6;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-03-01T09:45:59Z;UK manufacturing outlook dimmest since at least 2012, survey shows;Gauge of activity in factory industry also slips to weakest level in four months;Manufacturers’ confidence in the outlook for their business fell to its lowest level in at least seven years* last month as growth in new orders tailed off and firms ramped up stockpiling of raw materials in preparation for Brexit disruption.A closely watched index of activity in the sector, compiled by the research group Markit, fell from a downwardly revised 52.6 in January to 52 in February, the lowest level in four months and the second lowest since the 2016 referendum.Output was supported by efforts to reduce backlogs of work and build stocks of finished products in advance of Brexit, Markit said. However, domestic orders slowed and export orders fell, reflecting the slowdown in the eurozone.“Official data confirm that manufacturing is already in recession, and the February PMI offers little evidence that any shortlived boost to output from stockbuilding is sufficient to claw the sector back into growth territory,” said Rob Dobson, director at Markit.*This story has been amended to correct the date at which IHS Markit began collecting data on the outlook of UK manufacturers.
7;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2019-01-30T08:08:11Z;IHS Markit buys stake in blockchain start-up Cobalt;Investment comes as banks hunt for cost savings in currencies trade processing;Data and analytics company IHS Markit has bought a stake in currencies start-up Cobalt, in an effort to boost the use of blockchain technology to handle the fiddly business of trade processing.Cobalt was set up in 2015 by former Citi banker Andy Coyne and ex-trader Adrian Patten to create a cheaper and more efficient alternative to incumbents by using distributed ledger technology. The size and cost of IHS Markit’s new stake has not been disclosed.The investment comes as banks hunt for cost savings in trade processing as the margins they can demand from clients are squeezed. While trading in currencies is overwhelmingly done on electronic venues and increasingly through algorithms, processes that take place after trading have remained largely manual, fragmented and expensive. Technology investment over the years has largely focused on improving trade execution.“For too long, FX has been burdened by an ageing, inefficient post-trade environment,” said Mr Patten. “If we were to start building out connections to the market it would take years and years. Being able to plug into the [Markit] network means that we can get clients on board quicker and we can show significant cost savings to clients in year one.”Most large banks have a multitude of systems for post-trade processing, which creates additional costs and inconsistencies and leads to replication. That complexity also increases the amount that institutions have to pay for messaging and getting transactions completed.Cobalt has developed a way to create a single, unchangeable record for FX transactions, which Mr Patten said could cut costs by up to 80 per cent. Up to now, he said, the company had lacked the reach of some established peers.IHS Markit’s derivatives processing unit, dubbed MarkitSERV, is connected to more than 800 counterparties in the foreign exchange market. Through this deal, they will be able to access the full suite of Cobalt’s products and services with the existing network.“We are trying to re-engineer the whole trade lifecycle and create savings for our clients. It’s quite a profound change for the market overall because delivering confirmation at a much lower cost will allow clients to cut headcount, costs and to fully invest their balance sheet,” said Chris Leaver, managing director and head of FX at MarkitSERV.This month, UK bank HSBC started to roll out distributed ledger tools for clients for processing currencies trades. That came after the bank used the technology internally for more than a year to co-ordinate payments across its internal balance sheets.
8;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2018-06-26T03:00:52Z;Stockpickers prosper as value bets pay off with UK retailers;Companies that were poor performers in 2017 have rebounded sharply;Who said old-style value investing was dead? In the UK — the national stock market most loathed by institutional investors according to a recent survey — fund managers who have been buying out-of-favour stocks are enjoying their time in the sun.Several of the best performing stocks in the UK this year have been companies that were poor performers in 2017, most of which were in sectors that consensus opinion has for years believed were structurally challenged or even dying.Out of the top-seven best performing stocks in the FTSE 100 year to date, two are the supermarkets J Sainsbury and Tesco, up 30 per cent and 24.4 per cent respectively, while the high street fashion retailer Next Plc is up almost 40 per cent having lost 55 per cent of its value from its peak in 2015 to its trough in the middle of last year. All of these companies had been viewed as under threat by online competition or lower-cost challengers to the extent that loathing them became commonplace.Another characteristic of the FTSE’s top performers is that, as a result of their once universally hated status, many have been bet against heavily by hedge funds. These funds have subsequently been forced to cover their positions as these stocks have risen in value, likely driving prices even higher.Ocado, the UK online grocer, is the index’s top riser year to date having gained 162 per cent. In the middle of last year 28 per cent of its stock was out on loan to hedge funds according to Markit data, with this number having shrivelled over the past 12 months during a painful short squeeze.Disclosed short bets against Sainsbury’s have fallen sharply since it disclosed its deal to merge with Asda, while Tesco has similarly seen hedge funds pull back from shorting its stock as its business has shown signs of recovery.In spite of recent gains for some of the UK’s most hated stocks the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey showed the country remains the least popular destination for global investors, with many large institutions uncertain about Brexit and a limp domestic economy.What this suggests is that there may be further gains to come as the market slowly comes around to the idea that certain unglamorous but still profitable high street and consumer-facing businesses in the UK are not simply going to disappear overnight as a result of political uncertainty or the threat of Amazon. This is still far from a consensus position, and should eventually reward those who have enough patience to bet on it.miles.johnson@ft.com
9;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

However, the sector is consolidating because many lack the scale to compete as investors demand more combinations of data.Blackstone is now shifting its focus in the sector to market and data infrastructure, with its landmark $17bn takeover of the bulk of Reuters’ trading assets.Ipreo, whose customers include many of the world’s biggest private equity and venture capital companies, is “a perfect strategic fit for us”, said Lance Uggla, chief executive of IHS, told analysts. “It repositions our financial services segment in a faster growing market.”Ipreo, which made $290m last year, has had a compound annual growth rate of 11 per cent over the past five years.Mr Uggla forecast the purchase would help increase organic growth at IHS’s financial business from 4-6 per cent a year to 5-7 per cent. The unit grew at only 4 per cent last year.The Ipreo deal — at an effective 2019 forward adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ratio of 16 times — would be funded by debt, IHS said, pushing up its leverage ratio to about 3.6 times earnings.IHS said it would suspend its share buyback programme until debt levels fell back into the company’s target range, probably in late 2019.The other spur to higher growth would be the sale of its MarkitServ unit, which Mr Uggla had highlighted as a growth market as it prepared for its IPO in 2014.It processes electronic trades for over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange deals, but it had negative organic revenue growth in 2016 and 2017 due to lower credit volumes.“MarkitServ’s prospects are best served by combining them with other post trade processing businesses,” Mr Uggla said.Markit had bought the 50 per cent of MarkitServ it did not own from DTCC for $175m in cash in 2013. The unit employs about 500 people and generated about $150m in revenue last year.Mr Uggla said he expected the deals to close by the end of November.Martin Brand, a senior managing director at Blackstone, said its investment in Ipreo meant the company “has been able to deliver rapid innovation and revenue growth, leading to substantial shareholder value creation”.Barclays was lead financial adviser to IHS Markit, and HSBC acted as financial adviser. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley acted as joint financial advisers to Ipreo.
11;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2018-05-16T12:30:25Z;Cboe announces plans for US corporate bond market futures;;US derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets has announced that it is partnering with the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and data provider IHS Markit to provide a futures contract that seeks to track the US corporate bond market.Futures are widely traded derivatives products that represents investors’ expectation of the price of an asset at some point in the future – hence the name. But despite frequent trading in US treasury futures and stock market futures, there is no such product for the corporate bond market. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) launched credit futures in 2013 based on credit defaults swaps but the contract failed to gain significant traction. Cboe, in partnership with BlackRock and Markit, expects to list two new contracts this summer pending regulatory approval, one for high yield bonds and one for higher-rated, investment grade debt. The futures contracts will be based on the same Markit iBoxx indices that underpin BlackRock’s high yield and investment grade bond exchange traded funds, that use the tickers HYG and LQD, respectively. But just as HYG and LQD own a representative sample of the underlying index to replicate its value, the futures contracts will price based off what the ETFs own. The contract will be cash settled, so rather than receiving the underlying basket of bonds at the pre-agreed price upon expiry, investors will pay, or be paid, the difference between the price agreed and the value of the basket of bonds at settlement. The move comes as credit default swap volumes have diminished since the financial crisis, reducing trading in what was once seen as the primary vehicle to offset, or “hedge”, corporate bond exposures. Some investors have turned to exchange traded funds as a vehicle to hedge bond portfolios but derivatives, such as a futures contract, have the benefit of only requiring a small amount of “margin” to be posted when entering into the trade, rather than coughing up the full value of the transaction.“We believe this will provide our customers with a tool to mitigate credit risk in the corporate bond market,” said Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Cboe.
12;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2018-02-01T09:22:19Z;Eurozone manufacturing boom ‘in full swing’ — PMIs;;Eurozone manufacturing businesses are going from strength to strength, the latest batch of surveys of industry executives indicated on Thursday.Italy experienced the strongest growth in its manufacturing sector in close to seven years, business sentiment in the industry in France hit a record high, and the headline reading for Germany remained “buoyant”, according to the January IHS Markit purchasing managers’ indices for the single currency area’s three largest economies.“The eurozone’s manufacturing boom continued in full swing in January,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Output grew at one of the fastest rates recorded over the survey’s 20-year history, matched by a further near-record surge in new orders.”But while the headline readings for both Italy and France came in ahead of analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters’ polls, Germany — which has been the engine of the region’s recent boom — missed estimates by a whisker.Although, like Spain, both France and Germany saw a slight slowdown from December’s highs, the indices remain at historically very high levels indicating that conditions in the sector are robust.France posted a headline reading for January of 58.4 down from 58.8 in December, Germany 61.1 down from 63.3 and Italy — bucking the trend — improved from 57.4 to 59. Overall, the eurozone figure was 59.6, in line with flash estimates but down just a notch from December’s final reading of 60.6. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said of Germany:The sustained strong rate of job creation suggests there’s appetite for further capacity expansion amid a positive outlook for the year ahead.But he also pondered whether the record reading of December would be replicated:It remains to be seen whether the record high at the end of 2017 represents the peak of the current cycle, but the intensification of price pressures will inevitably cause some drag on demand, while the euro’s recent gain against the dollar may weigh on exports.
13;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2018-01-02T12:38:37Z;UK manufacturing enjoys best quarter for three-and-a-half years;Weaker December figures fail to take gloss off strong three months of growth;Growth in the UK manufacturing sector slowed in December, but strong performance the previous month meant the sector achieved its best quarter for three-and-a-half years at the end of 2017.The headline indicator from the Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector slipped to 56.3 in December, from a 51-month high of 58.2 in November, according to figures published on Tuesday.The December reading was weaker than the average market expectation of 58.0, but any reading above 50 indicates that activity in the sector is expanding.“Although growth of output and new orders moderated during December, rates of expansion remained comfortably above long-term trend rates,” said Rob Dobson, director of IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.The average reading for the UK manufacturing PMI for the final three months of 2017 was 57.0 — the highest quarterly figure recorded since the second quarter of 2014.Manufacturing makes up 10 per cent of UK economic output.“The manufacturing sector continues to be a clear bright spot, but it’s worth remembering that it makes up a relatively small share of the overall economy,” said James Smith of the Dutch bank ING. “Elsewhere, there are few obvious catalysts for a pick-up in consumer spending, particularly with real wages set to be more or less flat this year.”Other figures also published on Tuesday morning by Markit confirmed that the Eurozone manufacturing PMI reached its highest-ever level in December, at 60.6.Detailed results from the Markit/CIPS survey in the UK show that producers of intermediate and investment goods reported an acceleration of growth in activity in December, underpinned by solid growth in export orders. But this was offset by a slowdown in growth among producers of consumer goods.At the start of last year, official figures on the output of the manufacturing sector failed to match the strength indicated by the PMI. But in recent months the official data have started to paint a more similar picture. After declining month-on-month for the first four months of 2017, output growth in the manufacturing sector picked up in the second half of the year, according to official figures, reaching 0.7 per cent in September before moderating to 0.1 per cent in October.“With December and November surveys from both the purchasing managers and the CBI [looking] robust, the manufacturing sector looks likely to have produced another robust performance in the fourth quarter,” said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club.
14;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-12-04T00:51:40Z;Indonesia factory activity picks up in December;;Conditions in Indonesia’s manufacturing sector improved slightly last month after growth slowed in October, but currency weakness and lack of resources continued to drive up costs for factories, according to an industry survey.The Indonesia Nikkei-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 50.4 in November, up from 50.1 in October as factory output continued to rise and new orders growth picked up slightly.However export order growth slowed markedly and the pace of jobs shedding remained more or less steady. Input costs also climbed due to a lack of raw materials and currency weakness relative to the US dollar.Aashna Dodhia, an economist at Markit, said those factors “further weighed on firms’ margins as they were unable to fully pass on higher cost burdens to price-sensitive customers.”
15;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-12-01T00:48:45Z;South Korea manufacturing activity hits 55-month high;;South Korea’s manufacturing sector expanded at the quickest clip in more than four and a half years in November as domestic demand rose markedly.The Nikkei-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 51.2 in November, jumping by a point from October’s reading rising further above the 50-point level separating expansion from contraction. The rate of expansion was the fastest since April 2013.A sub-index for new orders also grew at the equal-fastest pace in 55 months, having previously touched that level in September. This came despite new export orders growing at basically the same rate as a month prior, suggesting domestic demand had been the main driver.Production also climbed in response to higher demand, rising at the fastest pace in 33 months.Joe Hayes, an economist at Markit, said cost pressures “remained elevated, despite easing slightly from October’s nine-month high. Nonetheless, supportive demand conditions encouraged businesses to pass on part of the cost burdens to consumers. Output prices increased at the sharpest rate since March.”
16;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-11-03T11:48:57Z;UK service sector expands at the fastest rate in 6 months;PMI surveys point to an acceleration in overall growth;Britain’s vast services sector expanded at its strongest rate for six months in October, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers in the industry.The IHS Markit services purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.6 in October, up from 53.6 in September. A figure above 50 indicates growth, and analysts had been expecting a slight slowdown to 53.3 in October.The survey published on Friday adds to a run of better than expected PMI surveys for the construction and manufacturing industries.The strong data have contributed to the all-sector PMI for October, also published on Friday, showing the strongest rate of expansion by the economy since May.“The good news was that October saw business activity across services, manufacturing and construction grow at its fastest rate for six months,” said Chris Williamson, economist at IHS Markit. “The data point to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.5 per cent, representing an encouragingly solid start to the fourth quarter.”Official figures published last week found that the UK economy expanded at a rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter.Respondents to the services survey said a range of factors underpinned new business gains including domestic demand and new product launches.Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics, said an increase in new work volumes registered by the PMI suggested the services sector should be able to sustain its momentum.But while the survey’s headline findings pointed to an acceleration in economic growth, it showed that the rate of job creation had fallen to its lowest level in seven months and that optimism about the year ahead had dropped.“A downturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fuelled mainly by Brexit-related uncertainty, suggests that risks are tilted to the downside as far as future growth is concerned,” said Mr Williamson.The survey does not include the UK’s retail sector, which has struggled as shoppers cope with rising prices brought on by the weak pound, said Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.“With consumers still under mounting pressure from rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty remaining elevated, we doubt that the economy is about to accelerate yet,” he added.
17;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-11-01T00:49:00Z;South Korea manufacturers see second month of growth;;South Korea’s manufacturing sector expanded for a second month in October – but at a fractional pace as new export orders shrank.The Nikkei-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 50.2 in October, just above the 50-point line that separates expansion from contraction. The reading marks the first time the gauge has registered expansion for two consecutive months since July 2016.A sub-index for manufacturing output fell back into contraction after snapping a 13-month stretch of decline, although new orders climbed for the fifth straight month. New export orders contracted for a second month running.Joe Hayes, an economist at Markit, said “the mild influx of new business was linked to sharp input cost inflation arising from hikes to raw material prices. Orders were received ahead of schedule in anticipation of further cost pressures, as customers attempt to hedge against a continuation of the current inflationary trend.”
18;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-10-25T08:43:49Z;‘Growth party’: German business confidence at record level;;German business is more confident than ever, according to a closely-watched index, with companies more optimistic about future conditions than at any time since 2010.The data from the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) underline the strength of the economic recovery in the eurozone’s largest economy and mark a pick-up in confidence after last month’s elections.The October reading for Ifo’s business climate index came in at a new record high of 116.7, up from 115.3 in September, topping the highest estimate in a Reuters poll.The business expectations index likewise beat all expectations to reach 109.1 — 1.8 points above the consensus estimate and above a revised September figure of 107.5.Current conditions also improved according to the third Ifo index, to 124.8 from 123.7 a month ago. Economists had been expecting a drop.The figures from Ifo follow another strong set of German manufacturing data earlier this week. Conditions in Germany’s factory sector continued improving at a rate close to September’s near six-and-a-half year high in October, flash data from the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index showed on Tuesday.Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING said (with our emphasis):Over the past one and a half years, the manufacturing sector has staged a remarkable rebound…Looking ahead, filled order books and low inventories should keep the manufacturing sector an important growth engine. If the ECB manages to orchestrate a dovish tapering, without a stronger euro or higher bond yields, the external stimulus for the German economy will also remain intact going into 2018.
19;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK construction activity falls for first time in 13 months;;“Fragile confidence and subdued risk appetite” in the commercial building sector caused activity in the UK’s construction sector to decline for the first time in more than a year in September, according to a closely-watched survey.The purchasing managers’ index for the construction sector dropped from 51.1 to 48.1, below the key 50 level that indicates expansion over the month. Economists had expected slight growth with a reading of around 51.The data follow similarly disappointing results from IHS Markit’s survey of the manufacturing sector, released on Monday, and will fuel fears that waning confidence is causing an economic slowdown. The figures knocked a little shine off sterling, which slipped to a 0.14 per cent loss for the day against the dollar at $1.3255The PMI surveys question firms on factors such as new orders, hiring and inventories to gain a picture of the overall health of a sector, and are seen as useful early indicators of growth.Large numbers of survey respondents pointed to “political and economic uncertainty” as a cause of the decline in commercial development projects, with clients taking longer to approve budgets. Firms also appeared to be worried that the negative trend will continue, with expectations for growth over the next 12 months showing business optimism at its second-lowest level since April 2013.House building was the only sub-sector to report an expansion over the month, but even there growth fell to a six-month low, with companies noting “worries about less favourable market conditions ahead”.Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Insittute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey alongside IHS Markit, said:A dismal picture of construction emerged this month as the sector showed signs of worsening business conditions across the board. With the biggest contraction in overall activity since July 2016, and a drop in new orders, optimism was in short supply.Official figures showed output in the construction sector fell in the second quarter, and Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the sector looks to be entering recession:Steeper declines in construction output likely lie ahead, given that official data show that new orders fell by 7.8 per cent quarter on quarter in Q2, the biggest drop for five years. Markit also reported that business optimism fell to its second-lowest level since April 2013, suggesting that the government’s shift to a more accommodating stance in Brexit talks has done little to convince builders that clients will sanction delayed projects soon.

Economists had expected a reading of 53.0.The score reflected improvements in new orders, output and recruitment among respondents to IHS Markit’s survey.Andrew Harker, IHS Markit associate director, said the latest data offer “some reassurance that the current period of expansion will continue in the near-term at least”, after some early signs of a slowdown in recent months.

Markit’s seasonally adjusted household finance index was well off the neutral threshold of 50.0 at 42.8 in September, and down from 43.4 in August.Still, households indicated a continued recovery in house price expectations in September – the metric hit a 10-month low in June – and spending lifted at a faster rate amid reduced savings and modest income growth.Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said:The subdued picture looks unlikely to change any time soon. While pessimism about future finances eased somewhat in September, sentiment remained among the gloomiest seen over the past three years.The data was based on the results of a survey by polling company Ipsos Mori, which questioned 1,500 people.
22;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-09-10T04:02:42Z;Best-known high yield funds ‘disappoint’;Underwhelming returns are blamed on fees;The world’s two largest high yield corporate bond ETFs mark their 10th anniversary this year — yet both face questions over whether they have provided investors with the performance they promised.BlackRock’s flagship $18.3bn high yield ETF, along with its closest rival, State Street’s $12.5bn bond fund, have become essential investment tools.BlackRock’s HYG has delivered annualised returns of 5.7 per cent since its launch in April 2007. However, its performance target, the Markit iBoxx Liquid High Yield Index, registered annualised returns of 6.2 per cent over the same period.State Street launched JNK in November 2007 and has delivered annualised returns of 5.9 per cent since. But it too has underperformed against its stated benchmark — the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Very Liquid Index, which has registered annualised returns of 8.1 per cent.High yield is one of the more challenging fixed income markets for both active managers and index tracking ETFs. Not all high yield bonds trade every day so pricing can be more problematic than in a more liquid market, such as US government bonds, where liquidity is plentiful.Traditional active managers that aim to beat the market by picking individual bonds claim that the pricing and liquidity challenges of the high yield market provide them with an advantage over passive ETFs, which cannot deviate from strict preset rules.Stephen Baines, portfolio manager at Kames Capital, the Edinburgh-based investment house, says the returns delivered by HYG and JNK are “somewhat disappointing” due in part to their fees, which were higher than for ETFs that track equity markets. Annual management fees for HYG and JNK are 49 basis points and 40bp, respectively, compared with an average of about 26bp for equity ETFs.Mr Baines believes the US high yield bond market is simply “too big” for any single ETF to track efficiently.There are about 1,900 individual bonds trading in the US high yield market but the major ETFs hold around only 1,000 securities.“This means these trackers have taken the decision to ignore hundreds of securities, leaving behind plenty of selection opportunities for active managers,” says Mr Baines.Despite the opportunities, underperformance is widespread among active high yield managers, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the data provider. Its analysis suggests fewer than one in 10 active managers outperformed the index in 2016. Over the past 10 years, just under 97 per cent of active managers have underperformed the US high yield index.Matthew Tucker, head of the iShares fixed income strategy team at BlackRock, says ETFs have provided investors with more choice.“There are some very good active high yield funds that investors can choose if they have a firm conviction that these managers will continue to deliver outperformance. HYG sits in the top half of the pack for returns over the past decade, once fees are taken into account,” he says.Mr Tucker rejects criticisms of HYG’s performance in tracking its benchmark. “BlackRock has delivered consistently strong tracking between HYG and its underlying index, outperforming by 2 bps annually since inception, once the drag from the management fee is taken into account,” he says.Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street, says changes in the methodology of calculating JNK’s target index have distorted the historic performance comparisons between the ETF and its benchmark.“The historic data are not an accurate reflection of the current performance of JNK in how well it tracks its benchmark,” he says. He adds that State Street has revamped its portfolio management systems and support teams, resulting in a marked improvement in JNK’s tracking performance.Mr Bartolini rejects the view that index-tracking high yield ETFs exclude too many securities. “JNK provides a highly diverse exposure to the high yield market in a single wrapper,” he says. “Active managers have on average around 300 holdings in their high yield portfolios so they are taking more concentrated bets with more exposure to single stock risks.”Mr Tucker notes ETFs such as HYG increasingly are used as tools by active high yield managers to help them reduce costs and to manage risks. “So the ETF is not always a competitor to an actively managed high yield fund,” he says.In addition, high yield ETFs are now used widely in the highly sophisticated model portfolios offered by wealth managers and broker dealers.“Only ETFs can provide the liquidity and low transaction costs required for asset allocation changes or rebalancing by these investment portfolios, which are often very large,” says Mr Tucker.

Confidence remained positive, albeit at the lowest level seen in more than a year.Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said that companies were “confident enough to continue to add to their workforce numbers, and employment continues to rise nicely”.“However, a slide in service sector confidence to a 13-month low provides a little concern that growth could continue to falter in the near-term,” Mr Smith said.
24;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-09-01T10:12:55Z;Faster growth and optimistic manufacturers: Greek recovery continues;;It has been a good day for Greek economic data. No, really.Official figures released on Friday showed the country’s economy grew faster than previously thought in the first half of the year, while a private-sector survey suggested momentum has continued into the third quarter.Gross domestic product grew by 0.5 per cent in both the first and second quarters, according to the Hellenic Statistical Authority.Initial estimates suggested the economy fell back into recession at the start of the year, but the first-quarter data were revised upward for a second time on Friday.Separately, IHS Markit’s latest survey of Greek manufacturers recorded its strongest results in nine years. The purchasing mangers’ index for the manufacturing sector increased from 50.5 to 52.2 in July, with survey respondents reporting their highest rate of job creation for more than 17 years.Firms benefited from increased domestic demand as well as higher exports as recovery in the rest of the eurozone accelerates.Alex Gill, IHS Markit economist, said:Having endured years of economic malaise, the latest data will be music to the ears of many concerned with the Greek manufacturing sector.Business confidence remained marked, despite dipping slightly from last month’s record high. The strong degree of optimism can at least partially account for the rise in demand, and is perhaps indicative of a more positive narrative surrounding the Greek economy, spurred on by the country’s return to bond markets in July. While this is good news, issues pertaining to the country’s debt burden remain unchanged and continue to present a potential roadblock to a sustainable, long-term recovery.

The index had notched its first growth in eleven months in June at 50.1 but slipped back into contraction in July at 49.1.A sub-index for manufacturing output continued what is now a 13-month decline, reflecting ongoing weakness in the domestic economy and subdued demand from businesses. Lower output also saw purchasing activity soften further from July.Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said an unfavourable exchange rate had led to a rise in input costs and eaten into margins.“Moreover, modest sales growth continues to be met directly from warehouses, with finished goods stocks declining in August to the greatest degree since January,” Smith said.However, the rate of contraction in August weakened visibly from July. Sub-indexes for employment and new orders were both up, continuing a trend of recent months and, despite lower production volumes, optimism among the country’s manufacturers strengthened in August.

That exceeded economists’ expectations of 54.5. The services index slipped to a seven-month low of 55.5 from 56, leaving the overall composite at 55.6.“The latest data paint another positive picture of the French private sector economy, with further strong expansions in both new business and output. The data are particularly promising for the manufacturing sector,” said Alex Gill, an economist at IHS Markit.

Economists had expected the measure to inch up just 0.1 per cent on the month.The habits of UK consumers have been closely scrutinised by economists in the wake of the Brexit vote. Consumer spending defied expectations by holding up surprisingly well after the referendum and supporting economic growth until the end of 2016.But rising inflation and still anaemic wage growth had led to the first fall in real incomes in over two years for British workers this year. Inflation is expected to peak at 3 per cent in October before falling back slowly over the next 12 months. Weekly wage growth however remains stuck around the 2 per cent mark.“The underlying trend at the beginning of 2017 showed a relatively subdued picture in retail sales”, said Ole Black, senior statistician at the ONS.Sales including fuel rose o.3 per cent with food the best performing sub-group. All other categories, such as non-store sales and petrol, declined in July.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the figures marked a poor start to the new quarter and still “suggest sales are on a weakening trend”.Howard Archer, economist at EY Item Club said the data still pointed to a squeezed consumer who was mostly likely putting off big spending on one-off items:A drop in most sales categories except food points to consumer caution in making discretionary purchases.This fuels suspicion that the pick-up in retail sales in the second quarter was partly a correction to the sharp fall in the first quarter, helped by some warmer weather and the later Easter.

Any figure over 50 indicates expansion.The service sector accounts for around four-fifths of the UK economy and showed gradual signs of picking up in the second quarter of the year. Official GDP figures show the sector expanded by 0.5 per cent in the three months to June from 0.1 per cent at the start of the year.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index asks businesses about their output, hiring and expectations to provide a broad picture of the health of the UK economy.Manufacturing activity, as measured by the PMIs, also accelerated in July on the back of rising export orders, while the construction sector dipped to an 11-month low.Overall, the surveys suggest UK GDP growth will stay at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, matching the previous quarter, but still a “sluggish expansion”, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit.In encouraging news for the UK’s labour market – which already boasts its lowest unemployment in over a decade – service sector firms reported their best rate of hiring since early 2016. But businesses remained relatively downbeat on their outlook for the next 12 months as the government has started its quest to extricate itself from the EU.“The subdued level of business optimism suggests it’s likely that growth will at least remain modest and could easily weaken in coming months”, said Mr Williamson.Later today, the Bank of England will be giving its latest quarterly outlook on the UK economy in its Inflation Report. The BoE is expected to deliver a small trim to its GDP forecast for the year after the economy suffered its slowest first half to the year since 2011.The BoE is expected to keep its interest rates unchanged at a record low of 0.25 per cent after a tight 5-3 voting split in June.Read more on the UK’s economic fortunes:

Companies surveyed for the gauge cited lower demand from China as well as Japan for the fall.However, a sub-index for employment rose for the first time in eleven months as manufacturers remained optimistic about the prospects for increased output over the coming 12 months.Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said companies were engaged in a round of destocking as they aimed to adjust to subdued demand.“Until this is achieved, growth is therefore likely to remain subdued in the near-term at least,” he said, “although companies are retaining some optimism about future conditions, with firms on average forecasting growth for the 12 months ahead.”The reports of subdued export growth from the Nikkei-Markit gauge stand in stark contrast to the latest figures from South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy showing export growth jumped to a three-month high in July, marking a ninth straight month of expansion.
31;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-07-03T08:15:20Z;Eurozone manufacturing activity hits highest since April 2011 – IHS Markit;;There’s no stopping the eurozone.Manufacturing in the single currency area is on course to post another quarter of impressive growth, according to the latest batch of monthly survey data from the sector, which hit a fresh six-year high in June.IHS Markit’s survey of eurozone factories posted another bumper month of activity led by Germany, France and the Netherlands last month with the overall index hitting its best level since April 2011.The headline PMI rose from 57 to 57.4 in June. Any reading above 50 points to growth, with even Greece – long the bloc’s laggard – hitting expansionary territory at 50.5.Eurozone manufacturing grew by 0.6 per cent on a quarterly basis at the start of the year as overall GDP expansion also hit 0.6 per cent, according to Eurostat.The manufacturing PMI has now been above the 50 mark for four years, noted Markit. The quarterly performance is also the best in over six years, said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, who highlighted strong export and domestic demand as the key growth drivers in the sector this year.“There’s no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon”, said Mr Williamson.“Optimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest for at least five years, backlogs of orders are building up at the fastest rate for over seven years and factories are reporting near-record hiring as they struggle to deal with the upturn in demand.”
32;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-07-03T07:37:41Z;Spanish manufacturing enjoys bumper employment growth;;Spain’s manufacturing sector was in rude health in June, posting another month of expansion, according to a closely-watched business survey.Job creation, purchasing, and new orders all rose last month according to IHS Markit’s survey of Spanish factories, suggesting another healthy quarter for the sector showing no sign of “running out of steam”.June’s purchasing managers’ index came in at 54.7 from 55.4 last month but remained comfortably above the 50 mark that points to growth. The PMI surveys are a good early indicator for official statistics.Markit said job creation in the sector hovered around 19-month highs – another positive for a country which still has the second highest rate of unemployment in the eurozone after Greece. Export orders meanwhile surged on the back of demand from France, Germany and the UK.“The first half of the year has been impressive, with no real sign among the latest data that rates of expansion are running out of steam heading into the second half”, said Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit.
33;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-05-08T22:12:37Z;Start-up trading venue trueEX sues Markit;;Start-up trading platform trueEX has filed a complaint against industry giant Markit, claiming the company, which provides post-trade services to derivatives users, engaged in anticompetitive conduct by terminating its relationship with the trading venue.TrueEX is one of the few new trading platforms to have gained traction with investors trading interest-rate swaps, challenging established players Bloomberg and Tradeweb.Markit is the dominant provider of post-trade services, operating the pipes that connect the various stages of a trade.TrueEX has had some success offering its own post-trade services and has since established truePTS to rival Markit as a wholesale provider of post-trade services.But TrueEX still relies on MarkitSERV’s technology to integrate its trading venue with its clients and currently provides trade details to MarkitSERV as well. That relationship is set to end on May 14, according to the complaint, which was filed in US federal court in Manhattan.Without access to MarkitSERV, trueEX will be cut off from post-trade technology that is ubiquitous in the derivatives market, with the complaint claiming it would deny trueEX from providing its own services.“This is a clear action by a monopolist to exclude a competitor,” said Dan Brockett, chief litigator for trueEX. “Our clients use Markit. If we can’t hook up to Markit then our clients are not going to trade on the platform. It will kill not only truePTS but also trueEX.”Markit declined to comment.
34;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-05-01T14:16:58Z;US manufacturing grew at slowest pace this year in April;;US manufacturing grew at its slowest pace this year in April, according to data released on Monday, in the latest sign that the sharp slowdown seen in consumer spending could have a knock-on effect on the wider economy.The Institute for Supply Management said the reading for its manufacturing index came in at 54.8 last month. That’s below the 57.2 recorded in March and much weaker than the 56.5 the market had forecast.Still, any number above 50 signals expansion and the April figure marks the 8th straight month that the gauge has come in above 50 following a lacklustre start to 2016.Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 16 reported growth in April. The only industry that reported contraction in April compared to March is Apparel, Leather & Allied Products.Another sign that growth in US manufacturing could be losing steam can be seen in new orders. The reading for the gauge was 57.5, compared to 64.5 in March.Meanwhile, the IHS Markit US manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, also released on Monday, was 56.5 in April, unchanged from the reading reported in March.Both data sets come amid growing concerns over the weakening pace of recovery in the US economy. Data published last week showed that US gross domestic product grew at just a 0.7 per cent annual rate in the first three months of the year – the slowest pace in three years – amid a slowdown in consumer spending.
35;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-04-21T11:56:15Z;French businesses shrug off pre-election jitters;Flash PMI reading suggests eurozone recovery is gaining strength despite political risks;French businesses shrugged off any signs of pre-election jitters in April, according to an important poll of corporate confidence in the eurozone that suggests the region’s second-largest economy is helping to drive recovery.Business concern at the prospect that both Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon could win through to the second round of France’s presidential elections has heightened over the past week. The far-right and far-left candidates have pledged to reframe France’s relations with the EU.But the latest purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone suggested the region’s recovery had become stronger despite the political risk of a far-right or far-left French president.The flash reading for the eurozone PMI, compiled by research firm IHS Markit, hit a six-year high of 56.7, up from 56.4 in March and way above the 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity.A separate reading for France was 57.4, compared with 56.3 for Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy.“Even though on the eve of the first round of the French elections a good portion of caution is recommendable, evidence is piling up that the eurozone economy could become the positive growth surprise of the year,” said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING-DiBa, a bank.The poll of French purchasing managers signalled its manufacturers had benefited from the weaker euro. “The numbers provide further evidence that the French private sector remains resilient to political uncertainty around the upcoming presidential election,” said Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit. “Indeed, business optimism hit a multiyear high in April, with a number of respondents anticipating favourable business conditions following its conclusion. This has, in turn, encouraged firms to take on additional staff members.”While there is an outside chance of a win for Ms Le Pen or Mr Mélenchon, business sentiment has been lifted by the prospect of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron winning the presidential race. Mr Macron, who remains the favourite, has said he will create a more business-friendly environment in France, lowering corporate taxes and easing labour regulations.A combination of cheap oil, low interest rates and a greater supply of credit, and the rolling back of tough austerity measures in parts of the region has helped keep the eurozone’s recovery on track despite political uncertainty.The strong PMI will be welcomed in Frankfurt, where the region’s top central bankers will meet on Thursday to discuss how to shore up the recovery. The European Central Bank is expected to maintain a cautious attitude on the region’s economy ahead of the second round of the French election. But — barring wins for Ms Le Pen or Mr Mélenchon on Sunday — ECB president Mario Draghi could acknowledge that the PMIs offer fresh evidence of the region’s recovery.The ECB’s governing council said last month that the eurozone’s economic outlook was becoming more balanced, though risks remain tilted to the downside. One member of Mr Draghi’s inner circle, ECB executive board member Benoît Cœuré, has said in recent weeks that the risks to the outlook have now become balanced.
36;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-04-04T08:43:36Z;Growth in UK construction sector slows in March;;A slowdown in housebuilding dragged down growth in the UK’s construction sector, according to a closely-watched business survey.IHS Markit’s monthly purchasing managers’ index for the sector produced a headline reading of 52.2. Economists had expected the figure to stay steady at 52.5.The survey showed a particularly weak rise in residential building activity and only a “marginal” increase in new work, though civil engineering activity rebounded.The data follows similarly disappointing results from Markit’s manufacturing PMI released yesterday, which also showed an unexpected slowdown.Respondents were still “relatively upbeat” about their prospects for growth in the coming months, however, with optimism for the year ahead rising to its second-highest level since 2015.IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply poll businesses across the construction industry – which accounts for around 9 per cent of UK GDP – on measures such as new orders, inventories and hiring to get an overall picture of the health of the sector. A reading above 50 signals expansion during the month.Tim Moore, IHS Markit senior economist, said:A weaker trend for residential work has been reported throughout 2017 so far, which provides an indication that the cooling UK housing market has started to act as a drag on the construction sector.Duncan Brock, CIPS director of customer relationships, added:Where the housing sector acted as the main engine of growth over the last four years, this month it was slower and stuttering, while overall purchasing activity in the construction sector was disappointingly tame, shackled by a lack of new orders and rising costs.Now the trigger has been pulled to propel the UK out of the EU, the construction sector must keep an attentive eye on how the UK government’s negotiations will play out and whether consumer and business caution returns to hamper further progress.
37;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-04-03T11:05:55Z;UK manufacturing continues to expand;Growth was weakest for four months because of slowdown in consumer goods subsector;The UK manufacturing sector expanded in March for the eighth consecutive month but at its slowest rate for four months.A survey of purchasing managers working in the industry found that the slowdown was mainly in parts of the sector that make consumer goods.The survey, carried out by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, provides evidence that shoppers are cutting back in the face of rising prices.The headline result of the survey was 54.2 in March, down from 54.5 in February — anything above 50 indicates that more respondents reported an increase in new business than did not.Previous surveys of sentiment in the manufacturing industry have found optimism at its highest rate for decades and faster than expected growth towards the end of last year contributed to upwards revisions for estimates of economic growth.Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF, the manufacturer’s trade association said, “Today’s data certainly doesn’t set off any alarm bells but it does signal that the consumer, one of the big props of UK growth in recent years, is already under the cosh and if there is any loss of momentum in the global economy, these strong manufacturing indicators could falter.”Domestic orders were the biggest driver of new orders during March, although the fall in the value of the pound also helped manufacturing companies by bringing in new export business.Some economists hope that the fall in the value of the pound will help rebalance the UK economy away from dependence on consumption and towards exports, helping to boost the manufacturing sector.Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, said: “The survey data suggest that the goods-producing sector made a solid contribution to GDP during the opening quarter of 2017. However, it’s clear that the expansion will be less than the buoyant 1.3 per cent rise seen in the fourth quarter of last year.”A one-stop overview of the key UK economic data, including GDP, inflation and unemploymentManufacturing has been stronger around the world over the past six months. The eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, also published on Monday, reported the highest growth rate for six years.“[The UK survey] is not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination. But slower than we enjoyed in late 2016,” said Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank. He added “you can’t help but feel a tad disappointed” when you look at surveys of the sector in the US, which are also pointing to strong growth.The survey also reported that input costs for the sector continue to rise, because the weaker pound has raised the cost of imported raw materials, however the rate of input cost inflation was its slowest since September.
38;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-03-01T09:27:22Z;Greek manufacturing sector shrinks for sixth consecutive month – Markit;;Still no light at the end of the tunnel for Greek factories.A closely-watched business survey of Greek manufacturers pointed to the sixth straight month of contraction in February, amid a worsening in business conditions and concerns over the fate of its bailout programme.Markit’s purchasing manager’s index for the sector hit 47.7 in February, a slight improvement from January’s 46.6 – but below the 50 mark that indicates contraction.Greek factories reported falls in new business, staffing levels and purchases last month, with problems compounded by rising price inflation that pressurised margins.The deterioration in economic conditions comes as creditors in the EU and International Monetary Fund remain at loggerheads over Athens €86bn bailout programme. Bailout monitors are back in the country this week in preparation for a review that could unlock around €6bn in much-needed rescue cash for the government.But stalled creditor negotiations are taking their toll on the economy, which unexpectedly contracted at the end of 2016 at a quarterly rate of minus 0.4 per cent.“The underlying causes behind the latest downturn follow an all too familiar narrative, as waning domestic and foreign demand continued to weigh on output, leading to further job losses”, said Alex Gill at Markit.
39;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-02-03T17:14:48Z;Brexit Britain’s focus shifts from services to manufacturing;Surveys show consumer-driven growth is slowing while UK industry is boosted by weak pound;Survey data published this week seems to show economic momentum in the UK moving away from consumption-led growth and towards manufacturing.Growth in the country’s dominant services sector eased in January to the slowest pace for four months, according to a report on industry purchasing managers published on Friday.The Markit/CIPS index fell to 54.5 from 56.2 in December. This was still its sixth consecutive month above the 50 level, which indicates growth. Anything below this suggests contraction.This moderation follows other surveys that have pointed to a fall in consumer borrowing and confidence. Lloyds Bank, for example, found customers were spending more on essentials because of higher prices.Official retail sales figures, due in two weeks, will confirm if the apparent slowdown is genuine.The PMI survey for manufacturing on the other hand, published earlier this week, reported an acceleration in growth, indicating that the fall in the pound could help the UK rebalance away from a consumer-driven and services-based economy to one focused on exports and manufacturing.This survey also found manufacturing cost pressures rising at their fastest monthly rate since 1992 which — as UK exports often include materials imported from abroad — could limit the pace of any rebalancing.According to Friday’s data, services companies were also experiencing increasing cost pressure due to the fall in the pound, although more modestly than in manufacturing. The rate of input price inflation rose to the highest level since March 2011.Rising prices will probably constrain growth for services this year, said Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics. Many analysts expect that increases this year will begin to erode consumer spending power.Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, said on Thursday that one of the biggest reasons the bank got its forecast of economic growth wrong following the EU referendum was a failure to anticipate that people would keep spending.Their latest forecast predicts that savings rates will fall to their lowest level since 1963 this year as households borrow to cope with the rise in prices rather than cutting back on spending.Whether this forecast is correct will be central to growth during the next few years. If consumer spending falls sharply instead then so should economic activity.Friday’s services PMI might even overestimate growth in the services sector, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic, as “it excludes retailers, who likely will find that consumer demand crumbles as they pass on higher import prices”.A one-stop overview of the key UK economic data, including GDP, inflation and unemploymentHowever, the fall in the pound is boosting manufacturers’ competitiveness, Mr Bowman said. “We think that these forces will result in a rare period where manufacturing sector growth is higher than that in the services sector.”The “all sector” PMI, which includes construction and manufacturing alongside services, fell to 55.2 in January from a 17-month high of 56.5 in December.If this is sustained, the economy should grow by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. During the final three months of 2016, UK gross domestic product rose by 0.6 per cent, driven mainly by consumer spending and the services sector.“The survey data highlights the issues that the Bank of England will face in 2017, battling rising inflation while offering support to the economy in uncertain times,” he said.
40;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-02-03T00:50:00Z;Hong Kong business activity already back in contraction;;After just one month back in expansionary territory, Hong Kong’s business activity has dipped back into contraction.The Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers’ index tracking private business activity in Hong Kong came in at 49.9 in January, down from December’s 50.3 and putting the gauge just below the 50-point mark separating contraction from growth. It had previously spent 21 months in contraction.Falls in output and new orders accelerated from the previous month, both having remained in decline for 22 months.A strengthening dollar undermined export competitiveness as new orders from abroad fell at the fastest rate in nine months, while new orders from China fell for the thirtieth consecutive month. Yet input costs also rose for the seventh straight month thanks to wage growth and rising raw materials costs.The softening of headline contraction was aided by orders from mainland China dropping at their slowest rate since March 2015, but employment fell at a sharper rate in July and new orders and output once again contracted at a steady pace.Bernard Aw, the Markit economist responsible for compiling the survey, was blunt in his analysis:Overall, Hong Kong businesses remained pessimistic about the 12-month outlook for output, as reflected in our new-launched Future Output Index. Unless planned budgetary measures help to boost growth, policymakers may need to consider more fiscal stimulus.
41;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-02-02T09:36:41Z;"UK construction sector taps the brakes; PMI pulls back to 52.2";;Activity in the UK’s construction sector grew slower than expected in January, according to a closely-watched business survey of the sector.The Markit/CIPS survey of UK construction firms hit 52.2 last month, down from expectations of 53.8 and ending a four-month run of rising PMIs after December’s figure hit 54.2. Construction accounts for around 8 per cent of UK GDP, with any PMI number above 50 indicating growth in the sector.Markit noted the weakest rise in overall business activity since the post-referendum recovery began in September 2016, with the survey showing business activity and incoming new work both expanded at weaker rates than at the end of 2016.All three sub-sectors, comprising housing, commercial and civil engineering, recorded softer rates of output growth in January.Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, said:UK construction firms experienced a subdued start to 2017, with all the key categories of activity losing momentum. While housebuilding retained its position as the fastest growing part of the construction sector, the latest upturn was the weakest since the post-referendum rebound emerged in September 2016.However, the report also identified bright spots in the sector. Confidence among survey respondents about the year ahead hit its strongest level since December 2015, which the report said largely reflected new project starts and a resilient economic backdrop. Job creation in the sector hit an eight-month high in January.David Noble, group chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said:Despite the biggest rise in input costs since August 2008, the sector was in buoyant mood at the start of the year, with highest level of confidence since December 2015.In the short term at least, the outlook is positive, as long as economic conditions remain supportive and firms are able to control their rising costs.
42;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-02-01T10:12:58Z;Economists react as UK manufacturers face surging inflation;;Britain’s manufacturing sector is facing its steepest input price inflation in a quarter of a century, according to the latest monthly survey of factories carried out by Markit.The UK’s factory sector continued to grow in January, reporting its highest output levels in 32 months, but rising prices are beginning to bite.Markit’s survey revealed just over half of firms surveyed attributed higher inflation to sterling’s drop since the Brexit vote, with climbing energy and commodity prices making it likely higher costs are being passed on to customers.“With these ongoing cost burdens, manufacturers were no longer able to absorb these costs themselves as output prices grew at one of the fastest rates since records began. Consumers must soon be wondering whether these rising costs will impact on their daily life”, said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.Howard Archer at IHS Markit called price developments a “large fly in the ointment” that could help push up consumer inflation to 3 per cent later this year.Although the weak pound has helped boost competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, foreign demand for UK goods is also tailing off, according to the January survey.“The recovery is now solely dependent on domestic demand”, noted Samuel Tombs at Pantheon, who added:The new export orders balance collapsed to 50.9 in January—its lowest level since May—from 58.5 in December. This emphatically shows that the benefits to manufacturers from sterling’s depreciation remain far too modest to outweigh the costs for the rest of the economy in terms of high inflation.Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics takes a more sanguine approach and thinks the sector will enjoy a better 2017 compared to last year.The three-month average of the survey’s output balance is consistent, on the basis of past form, with very healthy quarterly gains in manufacturing output of nearly 2%, following growth of just 0.3% in 2016 as a whole.As such, this adds weight to our view that the manufacturing sector will fare better in 2017 than it did in 2016. And with the forthcoming rise in inflation set to hit the recently strong-performing consumer services sector, this could result in a rare period of outperformance of the manufacturing sector over the services sector this year.Related reading: Charlie Bean warns of a “significant slowing” in the UK eocnomy
43;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-02-01T09:37:00Z;UK manufacturers report highest price inflation in 25 years – Markit;;British manufacturers continued to feel the doubled-edged effect of a weak pound at the start of the year, with cost inflation running at its fastest pace in 25 years, according to a closely-watched business survey.Markit’s monthly purchasing manager’s survey of UK factories, which measures output, employment and expectations in the sector, hit 55.9, falling back slightly from a more than two-year high in December but was still comfortably in growth territory last month.Any figure above 50 marks expansion, with the PMI survey a good early indicator of official growth figures. January’s figure was in line with forecasts, with firms reporting the highest output levels since May 2014 but a softening in international export demand.A weak pound has doubled-edged effects for export oriented industries, helping make their goods more competitive compared to international peers but also pushing up the cost of imported goods used in the manufacturing process.Markit said input price inflation rose at an “unprecedented” pace and the highest since the start of the survey in 1992, with 55 per cent of firms attributing rising prices to the weak exchange rate.Manufacturers also cited factors such as rising commodity prices for the gains, which is expected to feed through to higher consumer price inflation.Britain’s economy has continued to grow at a healthy clip since the Brexit vote with growth at 0.6 per cent in the two quarters after the June referendum – matching its pre-Brexit vote pace and helping the UK end the year as the fastest growing advanced world economy.Manufacturing accounts for around 11 per cent of the UK’s economic output. Markit will be releasing its January survey on the British service sector – nearly 80 per cent of GDP – later this week.“The question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward”, said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.“Companies seem fairly sanguine on this front, as a new index tracking business confidence signals optimism climbed to an eight month high”, he said.Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds bank, said “firms will be cautious and keeping a close eye on costs”.“There will be challenges ahead as import prices continue to rise, affecting bottom line profitability, while the impact of some companies’ historical long-term currency hedging coming to an end may expose them to the devaluation of sterling that they have managed against to date”, he added.

Greek bonds and stocks have been hit hard this week after the International Monetary Fund ramped up its warnings over the country’s “explosive” debt dynamics.The IMF is due to make a final decision on whether to pump fresh funds into its largest ever debtor country early next week.Falling factory output and heavy snowfall was coupled with the highest rate of producer inflation seen in almost six years, “compounding the current misery for goods producers”, said Samuel Agass, economist at Markit.Chart via Bloomberg
45;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2017-01-05T09:34:11Z;"UK service sector soars in December; PMI hits 17-month high at 56.2";;Britain’s growth-driving service sector gained further momentum at the end of the year, according to a key business survey which climbed to a 17-month high in December.Purchasing managers at service sector firms reported a surge in new orders last month, helping push IHS Markit/CIPS’s monthly survey to 56.2 from November’s 55.2. Economists had expected the sector, which makes up just under a 80 per cent of UK GDP, to slow at the end of the year (any reading above 50 points to expansion).December’s numbers are the latest sign of a still robust UK economy after Markit’s equivalent survey for manufacturers hit a two-and-a-half year high, as exporters were powered along by the falling pound.Ahead of Markit’s services release, the highest since June 2015, analysts at Société Générale said the PMI gauge looked “unsustainably strong”, forecasting a slowdown at the end of 2016.A good early indicator of official economic growth, the PMI survey measures demand, employment and expectations in the private sector.Job growth in services accelerated at its best pace since January last year while a measure of future expectations also rose ahead of the UK’s impending EU exit talks later this year.The pound’s near 18 per cent depreciation against the dollar since the referendum has pushed up import prices for UK companies, with Markit’s price pressure gauge sticking at 5.5 year highs in December.Higher producer prices are expected to feed into consumer price inflation later this year and “add weight to the argument that the next move by the Bank of England is as likely to be a rate hike as a cut”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Official data from the UK’s Office for National Statistics showed the service sector expanded by 1 per cent in the third quarter of the year (June-September).With the British government due to trigger its EU exit clause by the end of March, economists have warned that buoyant business activity could be coming to an end.“The Brexit process will soon start in earnest and the uncertainty that this generates may see businesses choose to sit on their hands rather than look to expand and invest and hire new workers”, said James Knightley at ING.
46;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-12-19T14:59:01Z;US services sector cooled in December – Markit;;The health of the US services sector lost some of its momentum in December, with the pace of expansion reaching its slowest in three months.A preliminary reading of the purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, produced by IHS Markit, came in at 53.4 for December, down from the 54.6 recorded the prior month.While the figure is still well ahead of the crucial 50 mark that divides contraction and growth, it was weaker than the 55.2 reading that analysts were expecting.“Although service sector growth cooled in December, the PMI surveys indicate that the economy continued to show solid, steady growth at the end of the year,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.The surveys are consistent with GDP rising at an annualised rate of 2% in the fourth quarter, fuelled mainly by improving domestic demand. The December slowdown looks likely to be a temporary blip, not least because firms took on staff in increasing numbers in the expectation of rising workloads in 2017.The overall composite PMI for December – which combines with manufacturing readings to give an overall view of private sector performance – also slipped to 53.7 from 54.9.

When polls showed Donald Trump gaining on Hillary Clinton last week, the Vix, a measure of expected US stock market volatility known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, spiked to levels not seen since after the UK voted for Brexit this summer, while Asian equities took their cues from shaky US markets.Both campaigns are barnstorming competitive swing states, with the Clinton campaign sending powerful surrogates including President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, to advocate for her around the country and press their message that Mr Trump is dangerously unfit to be president. The Trump campaign is using its strongest advocate — Mr Trump — to make the case that he is the only one who can clean up corruption in Washington.Mrs Clinton maintains a slim lead over Mr Trump. But the race pits the two most unpopular candidates against each other, and the election, as many historically have, will probably come down to turnout.Early indicators are that Mr Trump may be winning the enthusiasm race, and he has clearly energised his white base. Mrs Clinton, meanwhile, may suffer from depressed black turnout, which appears to be down from the historic figures in 2008 and 2012, when Mr Obama, the first African-American president, was on the ballot.But American demographics are working against Mr Trump, who has demonised Hispanics in particular and run a campaign focused on the grievances of white people, and if Mrs Clinton wins on Tuesday, it will be driven in part by what her campaign hopes will be, and early voting indicates may be, historic Hispanic turnout.Early voting in several key battleground states shows Mrs Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump going neck and neck into the final days. Some 37m Americans had already voted by Friday morning, compared to 32m at the same time in the last election.Mrs Clinton had boasted a comfortable lead during the presidential debates as a string of women spoke out about alleged sexual harassment at the hands of Mr Trump, and a tape of him bragging about grabbing women’s genitals was made public. However, a new FBI probe into her use of a private email server and the release of hacked emails from her campaign staff by WikiLeaks have seen Mr Trump rise once again in the polls.The presidential nominees need 270 electoral votes to win the presidency and both will be in Manhattan on election night.Investors will also be paying attention to the US Senate race. While Republicans are expected to remain in control of the House, the Senate could be up for grabs for the Democrats.● While US politics grab the spotlight next week, the UK will remain in the headlines. A week after the High Court ruled that the government must seek parliamentary approval before starting EU divorce talks and face questions from policymakers, the House of Commons will hold a general debate on Brexit and workers’ rights.Neil Munshi and Mamta BadkarEurozone PMI pointersOn Monday, Markit will publish the results of its survey of purchasing managers in the retail industry across the eurozone, who were questioned in October. Average household incomes have been growing at close to 2 per cent a year for the past two years across the eurozone. Despite this, activity in the retail sector has remained sluggish. It has been over a year since the retail PMI was above 50 — indicating expansion — for two consecutive months.The retail sector in the eurozone has been closely watched since the UK voted to leave the EU, with commentators looking for any sign the vote has undermined consumer confidence.Among the three largest eurozone economies, Germany recorded the strongest activity growth over the summer, according to the PMIs, while activity contracted most sharply in Italy.Eurozone inflation hit a two-year high in October and is expected to continue rising in the coming months as energy price increases feed through. This will squeeze households’ spending power further. Gemma TetlowSigns of stability soughtIn China, recent inflation and manufacturing data has been positive, prompting talk of its economy stabilising.This follows months of poor results and fears about the country’s debt levels and a slowdown. So investors and companies will be looking for more clues with its latest batch of inflation and trade figures, which are released this week.September’s producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, showed positive growth for the first time in 54 months, while consumer prices also rose more than expected. But there are still plenty of concerns about the Chinese economy remaining. James KyngeFlagship UK retailers reportTwo listed UK retailers that are partway through overhauling their management teams will this week give an update on their progress.At Burberry, the maker of luxury trenchcoats, a recent reshuffle has seen changes in the roles of chief financial officer a chief operating officer. A new chief executive is due to start work next July.The company, which makes most of its revenue outside the UK, has been buoyed by the depreciation of sterling. But the resurgence of the British fashion brand’s destination outlets in locations such as London’s Piccadilly and New York’s Madison Avenue was offset by a 14 per cent fall in sales to US department stores and other wholesale customers.“The latest data points are nothing to be ashamed of”, says Erwan Rambourg, an analyst at HSBC. “At the same time, we see the brand underperforming bigger brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci.”Marks and Spencer is expected to post earnings before interest and tax of £260m for the six months to September, a 21 per cent decline on the same period last year.Steve Rowe, who started as chief executive in April, has spent the summer culling headquarters staff and readying a programme of store closures.People familiar with the plans expect the department store’s branch on the Champs-Élysées in Paris to close, along with some of its locations in China. Analysts will be watching closely for signs of similar retrenchment in the UK, where the company is a ubiquitous presence in the high street, but has lost out to internet-based rivals and newer high street operators such as Primark and Next. Mark VandeveldeGerman utilities under pressureUtilities Eon and RWE report third-quarter results in coming days at a time of wrenching change in the German power sector and new legislation that will inflict fresh pain on the companies’ balance sheets.Both RWE and Eon have gone through big corporate shake-ups in recent months. Eon spun off its conventional power assets into a separate company, Uniper, which debuted on the Frankfurt stock exchange in September, while RWE placed its green energy and grid businesses into a new subsidiary, Innogy, which floated in October.But the companies still face major challenges. Last month, the German government called on the four big utilities to pay €23.6bn into a new fund that will cover the costs of storing Germany’s nuclear waste. That is €6.2bn more than they had provisioned for.Eon has said it will have to raise capital to cover the additional cost, and analysts expect it to reveal details of its plans at the company’s results on Wednesday.Eon is also expected to announce fresh impairments, particularly of its remaining 46 per cent stake in Uniper. The market value of the holding is much lower than the value ascribed to it in Eon’s books.It would not be the first such writedown. In August, Eon reported a net loss of €3bn for the first half of 2016 after writing off €2.9bn on the value of its power stations.On the other hand, analysts expect few big announcements when RWE unveils its results next Monday. The company’s balance sheet got a big boost from the Innogy flotation, Germany’s largest since the IPO of Deutsche Post in 2000: €3bn of the €5bn raised went to RWE, and €2bn to Innogy. The company currently has a market value of about €20bn — more than twice as big as RWE’s. Guy ChazanLest we forgetUS, European, UK, Commonwealth and other countries this week honour the sacrifice of millions of members of the armed forces and civilians in times of war, specifically since the first world war.On Friday it is observed at the moment peace was declared in 1918, on the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, when Britain’s factories and offices hold a minute’s silence. Veterans Day in the US is both a federal and state holiday across all states.Remembrance Sunday then gives families and veterans a chance to pay their respects to those who died. A service for remembrance is held at The Cenotaph in Whitehall, where the Queen, prime minister and opposition leaders lay wreaths before veterans march past to salute their fallen comrades.Also next Sunday marks the first anniversary of multiple terrorist attacks in Paris that left more than 120 people dead. The series of attacks targeting young concertgoers, soccer fans and Parisians enjoying a Friday at popular nightspots was the deadliest violence to strike France since the second world war and came before another attack in Nice on July 14 when a 19-tonne cargo truck was driven into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais, resulting in the death of 86 people and injuring 434.

48;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-11-06T05:05:35Z;Investors bet against Mexico in case of Trump win;About three-quarters of the assets of BlackRock’s $1bn Mexico ETF are being shorted;Investors have placed bets worth around $745m that Mexico’s stock market will fall in the closing days of the US presidential race as opinion polls suggest Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has narrowed.The bets against the Mexican stock market have come via BlackRock’s $1bn Mexico exchange traded fund. Approximately three-quarters of the ETF’s assets are being shorted, suggesting some investors are preparing for a Trump win.Around 80 per cent of Mexico’s exports go to the US. The Latin American economy is expected to suffer if Mr Trump wins the White House, due to his protectionist trade and immigration policies.The ETF bets against the Mexican stock market increased substantially following the FBI’s decision to open a new probe into Mrs Clinton’s use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state.“We have seen a big surge of demand for [Mexico bets via this ETF] in recent weeks,” said Simon Colvin, a senior researcher at Markit, a data provider in London.The price of the iShares ETF has declined around 6.7 per cent over the past two weeks, tracking the Mexican stock market in US dollar terms.“[The ETF] and Mr Trump’s polling numbers have been moving in tandem,” added Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a New York-based financial analytics provider.Mr Dusaniwsky said that bets against Mexico’s stock market via the ETF had shrunk in the first half of 2016 to around $315m by mid-June, coinciding with weakness in Mr Trump’s ratings. But as support for Mr Trump rose in the second half of the year, so too did the short positions against Mexican equities.Investors have pulled around $1.2bn in the first nine months of this year from the 30 Mexico ETFs listed in the US and on the domestic Mexico stock market, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. Assets held in the 30 ETFs stood at $3.9bn at the end of September.Volatility in the Mexican currency has also reached a five-year high, mirroring the twists and turns of the US presidential campaign.Edward Glossop, a Latin America analyst at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy, said victory for Mr Trump would have “significant repercussions” for Mexico, but a weaker peso should help to cushion the economy from the worst effects.“The manufacturing sector and the states in the north-east where industrial activity is most concentrated would clearly have the most to lose. But the tourism sector should benefit from a weaker peso,” said Mr Glossop.

Any number above 50 indicates growth.Germany’s PMIs also came in at a 33-month high of 55 according to Markit’s final estimate while “five out of the eight nations covered saw faster expansions during October” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.France, the continent’s second largest economy which has seen its factory sector slump in recent years, also returned to manufacturing growth last month, with the PMI climbing to 51.8.“The only real blot on the copybook was a further contraction in Greece, although a recent switch to tepid expansion in Italy should also be watched closely”, said Mr Dobson.The eurozone economy grew at a steady if unremarkable 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but October’s figures suggest overall output should accelerate at the end of the year.A sub-index of the survey which measures output expanded at its best rate since in more than two and a half years while companies surveyed reported healthy domestic and foreign demand, said Markit.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg

The index, which measures output, expectations and jobs, was higher than the 52.6 forecast by economists. Any number above 50 indicates growth.Spain, which finally has a government after more than 10 months of political impasse, increased its economic output 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of the year, according to official GDP figures – exceeding the 0.3 per cent recorded across the eurozone as a whole.Manufacturing accounts for 13 per cent of Spanish GDP and seems to have largely recovered from a “soft patch” hit during the third quarter, said Andrew Harker at IHS.The sector has now been growing since late 2014, according to Markit, and has recorded nearly three consecutive years of employment growth in an economy plagued by unemployment of over 20 per cent.Spainish factories also recorded their highest levels of producer price inflation, which companies also passing on higher costs to their customers last month.“That said, the rate of inflation was only marginal amid reports of pressure from customers”, said Markit.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
51;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-11-01T09:17:24Z;Greek manufacturing slump deepens in October – Markit;;Greece’s manufacturing sector remained stuck in contraction in October, according to a closely-watched business survey that came in worse than expected last month.Markit’s purchasing manager’s survey of Greek factories, which measures output, employment and expectations, fell to a five-month low of 48.6 in October from 49.2 in the previous month. Any number below 50 indicates contraction.The fresh slump comes despite Athens’ left-wing Syriza government making headway in its bid to secure a new injection of bailout cash last month. Greece is on course to secure a €2.8bn tranche of funds in the coming months having completed all 15 of the reform “milestones” demanded by its EU creditors.Greek manufacturers reported falling new orders from foreign and domestic markets, a sharp increase in cost burden driven by higher producer price inflation, and lower output charges in the goods sector, according to Markit.Despite long-standing woes in the sector, factories managed to keep on hiring. Job creation rose for the fifth consecutive month in October, “in the face of a substantial deterioration of outstanding business levels”, said Samuel Agass, economist at Markit.“As input costs continue to grow, coupled with manufacturers reducing their selling prices further, the likelihood of jobs growth sustaining until the end of the year seems slight”, added Mr Agass.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
52;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-30T17:01:41Z;Deutsche Bank puts CDS market to test;Securities offering insurance against default heavily traded;As Deutsche Bank’s share price has swung dramatically throughout the week, traders have also fuelled demand for another type of security: the credit default swaps that offer insurance against a default by the lender.So heavily have these been traded that they have posed the biggest post-crisis liquidity test of the wider CDS market.While Deutsche Bank CDS remain the most liquid securities in the sector, some market players are growing concerned that capital constraints imposed by regulators might impede the ability of market-making banks to keep these securities trading freely.This pressure, they say, may grow ahead of the upcoming quarter end, because “credit valuation adjustments” — a routine re-evaluation of counterparty derivative risk carried out by banks and trading institutions — can require the purchase of CDS protection.One major concern is that, without the capacity to buy CDS protection directly, market players will instead look to short sell Deutsche Bank shares, or withdraw collateral from the bank to reduce their credit exposure. This could exacerbate the sell-off in the German lender’s shares, triggering a negative feedback loop that only increases the need for credit protection.“The menu of instruments by which a counterparty can hedge bank risk has shrunk to the point where it is shorting the stock, or nothing,” said one informed party. “I think the risks of a feedback loop have been known for a long time.”According to Craig Pirrong — a noted derivatives expert from the University of Houston, and a critic of some post-crisis regulation — overall liquidity in the single- name CDS market has deteriorated markedly since 2008, due to the risk-weighted capital constraints imposed by regulators.“It’s much more costly for banks to make markets,” he noted. “This is especially true for a name like Deutsche, because of the ‘wrong-way’ risk inherent in a dealer bank’s CDS.”“Wrong-way” risk emerges when both default risk and credit exposure go up in tandem, creating a situation where profits from a winning trade cannot necessarily be realised because the counterparty who owes the funds is no longer solvent.Since a bank with a short position in Deutsche credit would have to pay out just when the shorting market is most likely to be under stress, this would impose a higher capital charge — leading to a reluctance to make markets.Gavan Nolan, an analyst at IHS-Markit took a similar view of the CDS situation. “We have seen liquidity diminish in the last few years and this is mainly because of the capital requirements imposed on banks — there aren’t as many as there used to be and there’s been a big push from the buyside firms to increase liquidity.”Thus far, however, the market for Deutsche Bank CDS has remained active, with the number of quotes registered in the Markit database increasing, said Mr Nolan. Last week’s figures from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation showed that Deutsche Bank swaps were the sixth most heavily traded in their sector, supporting the view liquidity is not a problem yet.“I don’t think what we’re seeing in the case of Deutsche has anything to do with regulation,” said Mr Nolan. “The CDS are reflecting concerns over Deutsche as a bank, so I don’t think it’s an issue of liquidity,” said Mr Nolan.On Friday morning, the spread between buying and selling prices for CDS on Deutsche Bank’s subordinated five-year debt had widened by 42 basis points to 510 basis points. Equivalent CDS on senior debt were being quoted with a spread of 241bp.Other market participants expressed doubt that hedge funds would be inclined to short Deutsche Bank shares or withdraw balances because of CDS liquidity issues.“All in all, with Deutsche Bank there is no liquidity risk, and no solvency risk, only dilution risk,” said one market participant.
53;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-29T17:24:34Z;Short-sellers increase the pressure on Deutsche Bank’s shares;Credit default swaps also reacting sharply to trials of German bank;Traders are increasing their bearish bets against Deutsche Bank, as the share price loiters at multi-decade lows.The percentage of shares out on loan rose to 3.1 per cent, up from 2.4 on Tuesday, according to the latest data from Markit. Traders betting on a lower equity price of a company borrow the shares in order to execute a short sale.Investors have been shorting Deutsche Bank on the expectation that it will need to sell new shares in the market to boost capital, diluting the value of existing holdings, as it faces a potential $14bn settlement with the US Department of Justice. That has sent shares in the lender to a three-decade low, with the stock down 17 per cent this month.In New York the bank’s US-listed ADR plunged as much as 7 per cent late on Thursday after a report that hedge funds were pulling their money from the bank.Short interest remains below levels seen in early July, in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU, when 4.4 per cent of shares were out on loan. This time last year, however, less than 1 per cent of shares were out on loan.“You can see that trend that whenever there’s negative news surrounding Deutsche Bank, people do rush to short,” said Simon Colvin, vice-president at Markit, though he added that it’s not a “super-high committed short”.“If there was a long-term directional play, the companies where people are betting on a longer-term decline don’t see that volatility — generally the short-sellers tend to stay in the name.”Eight other European banks have short interest above 3 per cent, according to Markit. More than 4 per cent of shares in Credit Suisse are out on loan, making it the only large bank with relatively high short interest.Mr Colvin added that a lot of the short interest in Deutsche was probably “more to hedge their coco exposure than anything”.Coco bonds, or contingent convertibles, also referred to as additional tier one capital, are designed to take losses when a bank runs into trouble, and as such represent a higher level of risk than normal bonds. Some investors have gone short Deutsche shares but long their riskiest debt, which is trading at 75 cents on the euro and has this week edged close to its lowest ever levels.Credit-default swaps, which provide investors with insurance against the risk of default on bonds, provide another way to hedge exposure to Deutsche Bank and have reacted sharply to news out of Germany this week.The rates on Deutsche Bank’s senior and subordinated CDS spiked on Tuesday, implying a higher cost to insure, and a higher probability of default. They have since eased slightly — senior five-year Deutsche CDS is trading at 228 basis points, while the five-year subordinated CDS is at 459bp.Last week, there were 135 new contracts on Deutsche CDS, at a gross notional size of $843m, DTTC data shows, making it the most traded bank of the week behind Standard Chartered and Bank of China. Traders said this week volumes were likely to have risen.
54;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-29T10:55:45Z;Short interest in Deutsche Bank jumps;;Short interest in Deutsche Bank jumped on Wednesday, even as the share price recovered from multi-decade lows.The percentage of shares out on loan rose to 3.1 per cent, up from 2.4 on Tuesday, according to data from Markit – matching the highest level this month, writes Thomas Hale.Deutsche bank’s share price is down 1.1 per cent today, having climbed 3.2 per cent yesterday.It collapsed earlier this week to three-decade lows, with fears over the impact of a fine from the US government and weakness in the bank’s capital position harming sentiment. Over the last week and a half, the shares have lost over 17 per cent.Investors have been shorting Deutsche bank on the expectation that it will need to sell new shares in the market, diluting the value of existing holdings.Short interest is still below levels seen in early July, in the aftermath of Brexit, when 4.4 per cent of shares were out on loan. This time last year, however, less than 1 per cent of shares were out on loan.
55;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-23T08:24:32Z;Eurozone private sector activity falls to Jan ’15 low – Markit;;Has the cycle peaked?Business activity across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since the start of 2015 according to a closely watched survey that suggests the single currency’s moderate recovery could be running out of juice.Markit’s purchasing manager’s survey for the eurozone, which measures new orders, expectations, and hiring across services and manufacturing, fell to a 20-month low of 52.6 in September from a reading of 52.9 in August. Any reading above 50 marks growth, but the monthly performance points to still “sluggish” growth in the single currency area, said Markit.It is the worst reading since before the European Central Bank announced it was unleashing a wave of quantitative easing in the eurozone in January 2015 and suggests third quarter growth will slow to just 0.3 per cent.“It remains clear that the economic upturn is still fragile and failing to achieve any real traction”, said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.“Job creation is wavering as a result, with employment rising at the slowest pace since April”, he added.The continent’s services sector, which had been driving a moderate eurozone recovery over the past 18 months, recorded its lowest level of output since December 2014, slowing to 52.1 this month from 52.8 in August.By contrast, manufacturing – a sector that has long been in the doldrums – reported rising levels of new orders and exports to hit a three-month high.In a reversal of the usual pattern between the eurozone’s two largest economies, France enjoyed a bumper month, while Germany reported a surprising slowdown in its service sector, which is close to “stagnation” according to Markit (see more here).“The weakening momentum in Germany is something worth keeping an eye on”, said Julien Lafargue at JPMorgan Private Bank.“Although German manufacturers signalled the strongest rise in new export orders since the beginning of 2014, the services sector which represents two-thirds of German GDP is clearly struggling”, he added.Excluding Germany and France, the average output for the rest of the eurozone has reached its lowest point since 2014, according to Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.“With the PMIs implying that growth is not only still sluggish but also lost momentum at the end of Q3, pressure on the ECB to take action will continue to mount”, said Mr Brown.In a tentative sign of rising inflationary pressures, eurozone businesses reported their first month of rising selling prices since August 2015. Low consumer prices have been a scourge of the ECB for nearly two years, with inflation falling again in September.Higher producer prices are good news but it “will be a while to come before meaningful price growth will return”, said Bert Colijn at ING.

We have delivered a good ‘business as usual’ result with both sales and profit growth. Performance has been driven by Poland and the UK, especially Screwfix, and a stable profit performance in France.She added:In the UK, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the economic outlook, even though there has been no clear evidence of an impact on demand so far on our businesses.UK economic data has been surprisingly decent in the wake of the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Retail sales have been unexpectedly resilient while business activity surveys have rebounded after a deep initial slump.In August, Kingfisher reported a 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter, but again warned that it remains “cautious” amid Brexit-related uncertainty and a wave of strikes in France.

That’s the highest reading since October 2011.Here’s the breakdown:Jack Kennedy at Markit attributed the strong French reading to:Good weather over the tourist season was reported to have boosted trading, while easing wholesale price inflation provided a further boost to retailers. Correspondingly, the squeeze on margins eased to the least marked since early- 2011.The German retail PMI rose to 54.1, the highest level since March.Markit’s Oliver Kolodseike called the rise “robust”, noting:Although some panellists linked the rise in sales to promotional offers, others commented that increased tourism had also helped.Italy’s retail PMI still languished deep in contraction territory, even if it did edge up to a three-month high of 43.2.Markit’s Phil Smith said:Retailers remained in retrenchment mode, reducing spending on items for resale amid attempts to limit stock accumulation while also trimming staff numbers.

The survey’s cover private sector hiring, input prices and new orders.Germany, the continent’s traditional economic powerhouse, had a disappointing month as business activity rose at its slowest pace in nearly three years in August.The country’s service sector expanded last month but at 51.7 registered its lowest level in 37 months, while the composite number fell to 53.3 from 55.3 in July – a 15 month low.This points to eurozone GDP growth “losing rather than gaining momentum” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.With the numbers coming in the same week at the European Central Bank’s latest policy decision on Thursday, pressure for yet more stimulus measures will be ramped up, he added.The survey data will fuel expectations that the ECB would prefer not to wait before injecting more stimulus into the economy, adding pressure for policymakers to act later this week to help shore up confidence in both the outlook for the economy and the bank’s commitment to its inflation target, even if simply by extending its QE programme.There was better news from two of the continent’s traditional weak spots however.Italy’s service sector saw output rise to a six-month high in August on the back of rising orders and the first month of growing outstanding business in 12 months. The index Italian services hit 52.3 last month, up from the 52 hit in July. (Any reading above 50 indicates growth).In France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, services enjoyed their best month since October 2015, as the private sector cut prices at their fastest rate in four months in a bid to attract customers in August.Rising new orders and falling input prices helped France’s PMI gauge to hit 52.3 from July’s 50.5.France’s composite PMI – which combines manufacturing and service sectors – registered 51.9 in August, up from 50.1 in July.But in a worrying sign of future business, optimism in the sector fell to its lowest level in eight months, as respondents reported that “general economic conditions remained fragile”, said Markit.GDP growth in Italy and France was stagnant in the second quarter, but this month’s survey suggests an improved outlook in the latter half of the year, said Jack Kennedy at IHS Markit.Later this morning (0930 BST), Markit will be releasing its latest monthly survey of the UK’s service sector, which makes up nearly 80 per cent of economic activity.Analysts expect the sector to bounce back after its steepest fall since the financial crisis in the wake of the Brexit vote, helping ease the pressure on the Bank of England which had been expected to cut interest rates in the face of a deteriorating economy later this year.
59;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Spanish service sector beats expectations – Markit;;Growth in Spain’s service sector shook off a post-Brexit vote dip to expand ahead of expectations in August, according to a closely-watched business survey.The purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, produced by Markit, increased to 56, from 54.1 last month. Economists had expected only a marginal shift to 54.2. At 56, the index has regained the rate of growth registered before the EU referendum in June.Any reading above 50 represents expansion, and activity in the sector has has risen continuously since November 2013.Both business activity and new orders expanded faster than last month, leading to a further increase in hiring. However, inflation increased for both input costs and output prices.Andrew Harker, IHS Markit csenior economist, said:A key takeaway from the latest survey was further evidence of pricing power returning to firms as they were able to raise their output prices to the greatest extent since prior to the economic crisis.As was the case in July, the performance of the service sector was more encouraging than that of manufacturing, thereby helping to keep the wider economy growing at a solid pace. IHS Markit are currently forecasting a rise in GDP of 2.9% in 2016.The report is good news after last week’s manufacturing PMI showed the sector “broadly stagnant,” and will help assuage fears that political uncertainty could affect the country’s economic recovery.Spain has not had a government since last December, after two inconclusive general elections, and last month’s composite PMI reading, which also includes services and construction figures, fell to a 32-month low.Today’s update, however, helped August’s composite figure climb to 54.8, compared to expectations of 53.8.
60;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-02T08:33:25Z;UK construction shows signs of stability in August – Markit;;Contraction in Britain’s building industry moderated in August, improving significantly but failing to match the post-Brexit vote rebound seen in the manufacturing sector, according to an influential business survey.Output in the construction industry fell for its third consecutive month according to Markit and CIPS purchasing managers’ index which measures companies’ orders, production and deliveries.The PMI reading hit 49.2 from the 45.9 registered in July. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction but the August number is better than the 46.3 expected by economists polled by Bloomberg ahead of the release.The construction figures come after sterling’s 10 per cent post-Brexit vote decline drove UK factories to their best month since October 2015, data showed yesterday.But the falling pound is crimping UK builders according to Markit, which said input costs are rising at their fastest pace in five years as the private sector faces higher prices for imported materials.Uncertainty generated by the referendum result also weighed on construction firms who reported muted house building and commercial activity.Yet, with little changing in the UK’s current status as an EU member since June 23, the survey also found evidence of rising client confidence from the 39-month lows hit in July.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said firms were undergoing a “nascent recovery” in confidence and providing “hope that the near-term fallout from Brexit uncertainty will prove less severe than feared”:The downturn in UK construction activity has eased considerably since July, primarily helped by a much slower decline in commercial building. Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August.Chris Williamson at Markit noted the sector was going through its worst spell since 2009.“Cut through the noise and volatility of the past few months and the overall picture is one of the construction sector in a moderate downturn, and its disappointing performance so far in 2016 is a far cry from the solid growth seen throughout much of the prior three years,” said Mr Williamson.UK manufacturing meanwhile bounced back to report rising new orders, strong international export demand, and the first month of rising employment all year, according to Markit’s survey of the private sector.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
61;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-01T07:27:16Z;Spanish manufacturing ‘broadly stagnant’;;Spanish manufacturing growth “remained muted” in August, but avoided any further slide towards stagnation, according to a closely-watched business survey.Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index remained at the lowest levels since 2013. The reading of 51.0 was the same as last month and slightly brighter than economists had expected.A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The number of new orders returned to growth after a fall in July, but hiring pace fell, while output rose among consumer and investment goods sectors but decreased at intermediate goods producers.Andrew Harker, Markit senior economist, said:August was another challenging month for Spanish manufacturers. On a positive note, new orders returned to growth following a fall in July. However, the rate of expansion was only slight and the recent weakness in demand meant that firms raised output only slightly over the month and reduced the rate of job creation. The sector therefore looks to be in broadly stagnant mode at present, with manufacturers hoping to see some meaningful order growth before the end of the year to reinvigorate the sector.Spain has not had a government since last December, after two inconclusive general elections, raising concerns that the political uncertainty could put a dampener on the country’s economic recovery. Last month’s composite PMI reading, which also includes services and construction figures, fell to a 32-month low.
62;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-09-01T03:29:40Z;Taiwan manufacturing growth strongest in 18 months;;While manufacturing in much of the region muddles through, factory activity in Taiwan remains on the upswing.The Nikkei-Markit Taiwan manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.8 in August, rising further above the 50-point line delineating growth from contraction after exiting contraction with a reading of 51 in July.The export-dependent country saw production expand at the fastest rate since December as new order growth rose and exports picked up, though the latter’s pace of acceleration lessened somewhat last month.The most positive sign came from staff numbers, which rose at the fastest pace in two years to deal with the demands of greater production. Quoth Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist who compiles the survey data:The faster increases in production and employment were not enough to offset capacity pressures, however, with backlogs of work rising solidly again in August. This could prompt firms to ramp up production and staffing levels further in the coming months, particularly if client demand shows further signs of improvement.The improvement from Taiwan’s headline figure contrasts with other PMIs published today for Northeast Asian nations: China’s official manufacturing gauge returned to growth, but at a level well below Taiwan’s and as an independent gauge indicated stagnation, while South Korea’s factory activity fell into contraction and Japan’s finalised manufacturing PMI showed contraction was worse than initially thought.
63;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK jobs market in ‘freefall’, say recruiters;;"Uncertainty after the Brexit vote caused the sharpest drop in new permanent job appointments since May 2009 last month, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.The number of people placed in permanent roles decreased for the second month in a row, with London particularly badly affected, according to the data, which are based on input from recruitment consultancies.Only the north of England recorded an increase in placements.Temporary billings continued to grow, but the increase was the weakest in 10 months. The balance between permanent and temporary hires is a reflection of business sentiment, with companies making more temporary hires when the economic outlook is uncertain.Kevin Green, REC chief executive, said:The UK jobs market suffered a dramatic freefall in July, with permanent hiring dropping to levels not seen since the recession of 2009. Demand for staff remains strong with vacancies continuing to rise, but the sharp fall in placements suggests that businesses are highly cautious about committing to new hires. Economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU is undoubtedly the root cause.The record-high employment rate and ongoing skill shortages have made it difficult for employers to find suitable candidates for the roles available in the past, and this remains the case. We’re now seeing the added problem of individuals deciding to stay put rather than change jobs in the current environment.While there are worrying signs, it’s important we don’t jump to conclusions from one month’s data. The truth is we don’t know what long term consequences the referendum result will have on UK jobs; with the political situation becoming more stable and the Bank of England making sensible decisions, we may well see confidence return to the jobs market more quickly than anticipated.”The Markit/REC report on jobs uses survey data from recruitment consultancies to measure recruitment, vacancies and earnings across the UK labour market.Yesterday, the Bank of England said it expects a rise in unemployment."
64;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-04T08:40:09Z;Dire Italian retail PMI holds back eurozone;;Eurozone retail sales improved slightly in July, thanks to decent expansion in France and Germany, but held were still held back by a deep contraction in Italy, according to a closely watched business survey.The eurozone retail purchasing managers’ index (PMI), climbed to 48.9 in July from 48.5 in June.Readings below 50 indicate contraction, while those above 50 suggest, in theory, that retail sales are expanding.Markit, which conducts the PMI surveys, highlighted the “contrasting trends in sales performance across the bloc’s big-three retail sectors, with a further sharp drop in sales in Italy offsetting steady growth across Germany and France”.Here’s how they stacked up in July:Phil Smith, an economist at Markit, said:While German and French retailers are enjoying periods of steady sales growth, their counterparts in Italy have endured back-to-back steep decreases in sales of the likes not seen for over two-and-a-half years.There was good news in the form of “a tentative renaissance in the French retail sector being supported by the widespread use of promotional offers,” said Mr Smith, although this was “reflected in a notable deterioration in gross margins.”However, French retailers are set to face a bi-polar business environment over the coming months, with some strong tailwinds but also some potentially tough challenges.Markit said:Factors expected by retailers to boost sales over the coming three months include marketing campaigns, promotional activities, increased tourism and the back-to-school period. Those factors expected by French retailers as likely to depress sales over the next three months include a difficult social climate, terrorism, fragile consumer confidence and strong competitive pressures.“Germany remains the brightest light, with sales rising for the sixth month running and up sharply on a year-on-year basis,” said Mr Smith.But Italy was a different matter entirely. Mr Smith writes:It seems the retail sector is in the midst of a renewed downturn. After falling to its lowest level for more than two-and-a-half years in June, the retail PMI signalled another steep monthly drop in sales at the start of the third quarter.The recent downturn has led retailers to pare back staff numbers, with July seeing an acceleration in job losses to the fastest since September last year. Another sharp decrease in gross margins in a relatively low-cost environment demonstrates how hard retailers are finding it to drum up sales.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
65;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-04T07:53:03Z;Markit: German construction growth accelerating;;Growth in the German construction industry accelerated in July, according to a closely-watched business survey, the latest in a series of positive economic readings from the country.The construction purchasing managers’ index, produced by Markit, increased from 50.4 to 51.6. Any number above 50 denotes growth.The rise brings an end to four consecutive months of slowing growth in the country’s construction industry, and follows strong readings for Germany’s services and manufacturing sectors earlier this week.However, despite the improvements on last month, the outlook for the rest of the year was still negative.Growth was driven by increased housing construction, but there were declines in both civil engineering and commercial building output, with firms reporting the worst outlook for construction since last November.Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, said:It’s a bit of a relief that the Construction PMI ended its recent downward trend in July and rose slightly from the 10-month low recorded in June. However, the data signal only a slight rise in total construction output that was solely driven by higher activity in residential building. With new business falling for a second month running and business optimism at an eight-month low, there is still a danger that the headline number may drift into contraction territory in coming months.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
66;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T09:59:33Z;Eurozone economy shows resilience after Brexit vote;Rate of growth in activity quickened in July, PMI shows;The eurozone’s economic recovery remained resilient after the UK’s decision to break ties with the EU, according to a poll of purchasing managers that indicates growth in activity quickened in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.The final reading of the July purchasing managers’ index for the single currency area, compiled by data firm Markit, rose to 53.2, up from 53.1 in June and well above the 50 level that marks an expansion in activity. It was also above an earlier “flash” estimate of 52.9.While the eurozone was able to withstand the immediate impact of the Brexit vote, a PMI reading for the UK’s dominant services sector fell from 52.3 in June to 47.4 last month, the first contraction in activity since December 2012 and the sharpest decline since March 2009.“The UK has suffered a more knee-jerk reaction to the Brexit result. There has been a sudden loss of confidence,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “While there have been reports from the eurozone that firms are concerned about the outlook, actual trading has not yet been affected.”Separate readings for eurozone member states did, however, point to a re-emergence of a divide between conditions in the more prosperous north and the southern parts of the bloc.The German PMI reading was confirmed at a seven-month high of 55.3, while the index for Spain fell to a 32-month low of 53.7. For Italy, the reading fell to a two-month low of 52.2.“The concern is that political uncertainty in Spain and Italy will affect the economy. Along with Brexit, there is a broader ongoing trend of political uncertainty impacting the economy,” said Mr Williamson.Across the region there were signs of improvement in the labour market, with a separate reading for employment close to a five-year peak in Germany and a nine-year high in Italy.Unemployment across the region remains in double figures, just, at 10.1 per cent.There was also welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, with input prices rising at their quickest rate since July 2015, especially for services sector companies facing rising staff costs.Weak price pressures have meant the ECB has struggled to hit its inflation target of just below 2 per cent. Inflation in the region was expected to be 0.2 per cent in the year to July, up from 0.1 per cent the previous month.
67;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T08:57:32Z;‘A mild recession’ awaits? – Economists react to UK services PMI;;The latest purchasing managers’ survey for the UK’s service sector is out and Markit’s final reading has confirmed initial estimates of a sharp deterioration in output.The results follow even worse figures for the manufacturing and construction sectors earlier this week, and come as the Bank of England is widely expected to announce further support for the post-Brexit economy at its latest monthly meeting tomorrow.Here’s a roundup of economists’ reactions.Chris Williamson at Markit says the outlook is uncertain, but a recession is now looking increasingly likely:It’s too early to say if the surveys will remain in such weak territory in coming months, leaving substantial uncertainty over the extent of any potential downturn. However, the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the UK sliding into at least a mild recession.Service providers are certainly bracing themselves for worse to come, with a record drop in business confidence about the year-ahead leaving optimism at its lowest ebb since February 2009.Our forecast is for the economy to slip into a mild recession in late-2016 and to barely grow in 2017, with GDP rising by a mere 0.2%Dean Turner at UBS Wealth Management thinks it’s still too early to tell how concerned to be by this month’s figures, but expects a period of “lacklustre growth” as a minimum.Off the back of equally disappointing manufacturing figures, today’s numbers confirm that the UK economy is slowing. Although not currently our base case, if current levels for the PMIs are sustained, we may need to brace ourselves for a mild recession by the end of the year.Today’s confirmation of the downturn in the Services PMI should not be underestimated, with significant near-term implications for UK businesses.But until the fog of Brexit begins to clear, it is frankly too early to tell whether the latest string of disappointing data is a real cause for concern. Time will tell if a recession is on the cards but it is clear we now face a period of lacklustre growth, a sharp contrast to the above trend growth we’ve enjoyed for the last three years.Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics is more positive, saying the results are bad but may have been affected by initial shock in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.Overall, the weighted-average PMI is at a level consistent, on the basis of past form, with quarterly contractions in GDP of about 0.4%. But activity for the whole of Q3 may not be quite as weak as the July PMI suggests.Given that the survey was conducted fairly soon after the referendum (between 12th and 28th July) there is a possibility that this could reflect an initial shock factor. Meanwhile, other surveys haven’t been quite as downbeat. July’s CBI Growth Indicator points to an easing in growth ahead rather than an outright contraction in output.And the Bank of England’s Agents’ recently reported that a majority of firms did not expect a near-term impact from the referendum outcome on their investment or hiring plans. That said, with the mounting evidence of the initial hit to the economy following the Brexit vote, we doubt that the MPC will wait any longer before acting. We expect a 25bp cut in Bank Rate on Thursday alongside a £75bn expansion of the QE programme.Looking at the composite PMI of the services, manufacturing and construction sectors, Barclays thinks the Bank of England will ease monetary policy tomorrow, but doubts it will be enough to stop a recession that will last for the foreseeable future:The continued deterioration in firm sentiment during July, as illustrated by the decline in composite PMI between the ‘flash’ and ‘final’ estimates, supports our below-consensus forecast that the UK economy will be pushed into a recession from Q3 16, on an initial referendum shock, contracting 0.4% quarter on quarter in Q3 16 and by 0.3% q/q in Q4 16, before stabilising into a prolonged and shallow contraction of, on average, 0.1% q/q until the end of our forecast horizon.Looking forward, confidence seems likely to continue to fall in the coming months as high levels of business uncertainty force firms to become even more cautious with regard to hiring, spending and investment decisions, only to be amplified by a likely prolonged period of non-clarity regarding the post-exit relationship between the UK and the EU and the rest of the world. This view is emphasised by the marked drop in services firms’ business expectations, reaching levels last seen during the financial crisis. All in all, this weakness underscores our call that the Bank of England MPC is likely to materially ease monetary policy at the MPC meeting tomorrow.
68;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T08:32:32Z;UK services industry contracted sharply after Brexit vote;;Britain’s powerhouse services industry suffered a sharp deterioration in the month following Britain’s vote to leave Europe, a closely-watched survey of activity has confirmed.The final reading of the purchasing managers’ index – a well-regarded survey by research group Markit – came in at 47.4 for July, down from 52.3 in June.Although July’s outcome was in line with an initial estimate published last month, it suggests the fastest pace of decline in the sector – which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the UK economy – since March 2009. Any reading below 50 suggests output is shrinking.A similar survey for the UK manufacturing sector, published on Monday, suggested activity deteriorated at an even sharper rate than initially believed in the month following the surprise victory for “leave” campaigners at the June 23 referendum.The UK construction PMI, released yesterday, showed Britain’s embattled building industry fell further into contraction territory last month, although July’s PMI reading of 45.9 was better than the 44 forecast by economists.Taken together, Markit said the surveys point to a 0.4 per cent quarterly rate of decline in GDP. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:It’s too early to say if the surveys will remain in such weak territory in coming months, leaving substantial uncertainty over the extent of any potential downturn. However, the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the UK sliding into at least a mild recession.The pound was sliding against the dollar before the release of today’s services PMI at 9.30am UK time. At publication time it has erased some of its losses and is trading at $1.3350, almost flat on the day against the buck.The latest PMI surveys have been released before the Bank of England’s latest decision on interest rates tomorrow, when rate-setters are widely expected to announce further support for the economy to strengthen it against any downturn after the Brexit vote.
69;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T08:18:16Z;Eurozone services PMI creeps up for July;;The pace of eurozone economic expansion edged up at the start of the third quarter, according to a closely-watched business survey.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) tracking the eurozone services sector ticked up to 52.9 in July, up slightly from the 17-month low of 52.8 seen in June.That’s up from an initial estimate of 52.7. Readings above 50 in theory denote expansion.The composite PMI, which combines services and manufacturing, rose to a six-month high of 53.2 in July, up from an earlier estimate of 52.7, and above June’s 52.8 reading.But although the headline figures are fairly decent, Markit, which compiles the data, cautioned:Although the latest data signalled a solid and steady pace of expansion, national data suggested that the upturn was uneven by nation.Growth was primarily driven by an accelerated rate of output expansion in Germany, the fastest during the year-to-date. Rates of growth moderated in Italy and Spain, whereas France continued to hover around the stagnation markFrance’s service sector clawed its way back into expansion territory after languishing in contraction territory in June. Its services PMI rose to 50.5 in July, up from 49.9 in June. The composite PMI advanced to 50.1 from 49.6.Markit explained:Underpinning the renewed rise in service sector activity was a further increase in the level of new business received by French service providers. The latest rise in new work was the fifth in as many months and faster than that seen in June, albeit modest overall.Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit said France’s services sector compensated “for ongoing manufacturing weakness, leaving overall private sector activity broadly flat on the month,” but warned that:Overall [there is] little sign of any change to the subdued pattern seen throughout the year to date. Indeed companies’ business expectations remain at a historically muted level.Germany’s services PMI was revised down slightly to 54.4 from a flash reading of 54.6, but even so that was a substantial advance from the 53.7 seen in June.Germany’s composite PMI jumped to a seven-month high of 55.3 in July, up from 54.4 in June.Oliver Kolodseike, an economist at Markit said:Germany’s service sector continued to grow at the start of the third quarter with the underlying trend pace broadly in line with that seen over the past three years. Although new order growth also accelerated slightly from June’s recent low, the rate of expansion was relatively mild, however.Meanwhile, companies generally expect activity to increase further over the next year, but the level of positive sentiment fell to an eight-month low, with some companies worried about the consequences of Brexit. There were some more positive news for the labour market as companies raised their workforce numbers to the greatest extent in 2016 so far.The contrast between the collapse in the UK services PMI and the “bullish” eurozone reading underscores a “clear divergence between the bloc state and the UK”, said Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners, adding:Post-Brexit woes appear to be starting to filter into the UK’s most prominent sector which accounts for over 70% of total GDP on the home-front, whilst our European counterparts appear to be breezing through the Brexit debacle with ease.
70;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T07:54:07Z;Italy’s services sector makes further progress in July;;Italy’s services sector continued to expand last month as consumers so far do not appear to have been put off by concerns over the country’s banking sector and its vast pile of bad loans.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a well-respected survey produced by research group Markit – for Italy’s services sector improved to 52 in July from 51.9 the previous month. Economists had been expecting a fall in the reading to 51. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.The reading is positive news after a similar survey for the country’s manufacturing sector suggested output fell to its lowest level in 18 months in July.Italy has been struggling to sustain a recovery from a bruising triple dip recession but its banking sector – and banks’ ability to lend to the wider economy – have been in sharp focus recently, as the country is still grappling with a vast over-hang of bad loans.
71;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Sterling weaker ahead of BoE, services data;;The pound is sliding against the dollar this morning ahead of another round of post-Brexit data – this time from the growth-driving services industry.Sterling is 0.35 per cent weaker against the greenback at publication time to $1.3309 ahead of the release from Markit at 0930 BST. The equivalent survey from the construction industry was not as bad as expected in July, but manufacturing has slumped to its lowest level since February 2013.An initial estimate of service sector output suggests activity will fall to an 88-month low in the aftermath of the referendum.The pound is also selling off a day before the Bank of England is widely expected to make its first interest rate cut since the financial crisis on Thursday. The central bank will also reveal its latest outlook for growth following the referendum, with economists expecting the numbers to show the UK will just about avoid a recession.A weaker currency has also “dramatically changed the near-term outlook for UK inflation” said Chris Scicluna at Daiwa, who expects consumer prices to overshoot their 2 per cent target at 2.5 per cent in 2017.
72;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T04:33:21Z;Evens chance of UK recession by end of next year;Think-tank calls for ‘sledgehammer’ BoE action to counter expected economic downturn;There is an “evens” chance of Britain falling into recession by the end of next year, according to a leading economic think-tank, which called on the Bank of England to wield a “sledgehammer” against the expected downturn.The National Institute for Economic and Social Research revised down its forecast for growth by 0.3 percentage points in 2016 and 1.7 percentage points in 2017 — larger downgrades than those made by the International Monetary Fund last month.Niesr said on Tuesday that the economic slowdown “will add some £50bn to the [government’s] borrowing plans for this parliament” and push debt to more than 90 per cent of national income. This assumed the government would not announce any new fiscal stimulus measures.However, to alleviate the negative economic effects the BoE should deploy “as much of a sledgehammer as they can,” said Jack Meaning of Niesr — cutting interest rates and expanding quantitative easing. Though some have warned of the risk of doing too much too soon, Mr Meaning said he was not concerned about the BoE pushing monetary policy to its limits because “those limits are not far away”.Before the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, the think-tank warned that a vote to leave would increase uncertainty and hurt growth. “Data on post-referendum developments have done little to change our view,” said Simon Kirby of Niesr.The forecasts came as a July survey of construction purchasing managers, released on Tuesday, showed the sector had suffered a second consecutive month of sharply declining output. This signalled “the steepest fall in business activity since April 2009”, said Chris Williamson of Markit, which compiles the survey.The survey suggested the construction industry was “bearing the brunt of the post-referendum collapse in business confidence”, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macro. It comes after many investors sold shares in housebuilding firms shortly after the Brexit vote.Niesr’s central estimate is that the economy will avoid the “technical recession” that Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, said was a possibility in May. A technical recession entails two quarters in a row of the economy shrinking. The probability of this happening by the end of 2017 is “around evens”, said Jagjit Chadha, the think-tank’s director.Observers will watch closely on Thursday to see whether the Bank decides that a technical recession is the most likely outcome for the UK. But Mr Kirby said growth close to, but just above, zero would be significant even if recession was avoided.The first hard data showing the effect of the referendum on economic activity will not be published until later this month. But most survey data suggests growth has slowed and business and consumer confidence has fallen since the vote.Many indicators have fallen back to levels last seen in 2012 or 2013 but remain well above the trough observed during the last recession.
73;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T03:34:58Z;Hong Kong private sector contraction continues;;Sometimes a good old global financial nexus just can’t catch a break.The Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers’ index tracking private business activity in Hong Kong read 47.2 in July, up from June’s 45.4 but still well below the 50-point mark separating contraction from growth.The softening of headline contraction was aided by orders from mainland China dropping at their slowest rate since March 2015, but employment fell at a sharper rate in July and new orders and output once again contracted at a steady pace.Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist responsible for compiling the survey, was less than sanguine on Hong Kong’s prospects for the rest of 2016:Businesses had reportedly struggled in the face of a weak global economic environment, unfavourable exchange rates and a subsequent fall in client spending.Unless there is a meaningful improvement in demand, the data suggest that the sector will contract further in upcoming months, which is likely to translate into more bad news for the labour market.Hong Kong’s economy shrank 0.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter. Second-quarter GDP is expected from the Census and Statistics Department on August 12.
74;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-03T02:15:27Z;Japanese economy grew by a whisker in July;;Expansion in Japan’s services sector helped the country’s economy as a whole expand last month, but only by a whisker.The services purchasing managers’ index for July, compiled by Markit and Nikkei, came in at 50.4, up from 49.4 in June. The reading took the composite PMI for the month to 50.1, from 49 in June, ending a four month streak of contraction for the overall reading.Services typically outperform manufacturing, which drags things down. However the ‘business expectations’ component of the survey was at its lowest point in over four years, Markit said, with respondents expressing concerns over the UK’s recent vote to leave the EU, Japan’s ageing population and the slowdown in the Chinese economy.Data reported earlier this week showed the manufacturing sector remained in deflationary territory for a fifth straight month in July. In the first few months of the year two large earthquakes in the south hurt production, but the disruption merely deepened a downward trend.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:Latest survey data pointed to a slight improvement in business activity at Japanese services firms. New orders declined at a weaker pace, contrasting with the sharpest contraction in nearly five years seen in June. However, services firms cut back on their staffing numbers at the sharpest rate since last October, suggesting confidence towards the outlook is muted.
75;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-02T09:09:53Z;Property stocks fall again after construction PMI;;Property groups’ torrid time continues.It’s been a rough month for builders and estate agents, and today’s UK construction PMI has added to the misery. The results of Markit’s closely-watched survey weren’t quite as bad as economists had expected, but still showed a further contraction of activity in July after June’s seven-year low.Builders’ merchant Travis Perkins is currently fighting RBS for the FTSE 100′s bottom spot after reporting a slowdown in sales growth in the second quarter , down 3.4 per cent at 1493p.Elsewhere at publication time:Today’s drop follows another bad day yesterday, with Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley, Barratt and Persimmon all among the worst performers in an otherwise static FTSE 100.Property stocks have been hit hard by uncertainty following the EU referendum, with all the major housebuilders down more than 20 per cent since the vote.There has been some positivity, however. On estate agents, an update from UBS today reported “clear signs that the London market remains weak,” but added that markets are remaining stable outside of the capital.
76;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-02T08:53:01Z;Pound progresses as construction data not as bad as feared;;Bad news – but it could have been worse.The pound has picked back up against the dollar this morning after a survey of activity for Britain’s construction industry suggested a decline in output following the UK’s vote to leave the EU was not as severe as expected.Sterling is 0.38 per cent higher against the greenback at $1.3223 at publication time, having dipped before the release of Markit’s latest purchasing managers’ index, which suggested activity in the building sector continued to shrink in July.However, July’s PMI reading of 45.9 was not as bad as the estimate of 44 forecast by economists. Any reading below 50 suggests contraction.The pound was trading around 0.15 per cent higher against the dollar before the release at 9.30am UK time.Despite a largely grim report, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said investors were taking a “wait and see” approach rather than curtailing or cancelling projects:While there is little to suggest an imminent turnaround in business conditions, a relief factor appears to have softened the fall in business optimism among UK construction companies.
77;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-02T08:35:03Z;UK construction activity deteriorates further after Brexit vote;;Activity in the UK’s struggling construction industry deteriorated further in July after Britain’s vote to leave Europe, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index.The PMI, a well-regarded survey of activity produced by research group Markit, dipped further into contraction territory in July following the referendum, as investors are reluctant to plough ahead with major projects until they are more certain over the long-term effects of the Brexit vote.The PMI came in at 45.9 for July from a reading of 46 in June, which had been the poorest reading since June 2009. However July’s outcome was better than the reading of 44 forecast by economists prior to today’s release.Any reading below 50 suggests activity is shrinking. Markit said employment numbers fell for the first time since May 2013 last month as there were insufficient new projects to provide work for those who had been employed on completed projects.The weak reading comes after a similar survey for Britain’s manufacturing industry suggested output also contracted in that sector last month.The PMIs will add pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to announce action on Thursday to reinforce the UK economy against any negative impact from the Brexit vote.Property has been among the sectors that have been most under pressure since the referendum, amid forecasts that house prices could fall.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said of the latest PMI:July’s survey is the first construction PMI compiled entirely after the EU referendum result and the figures confirm a clear loss of momentum since the second quarter of 2016, led by a steep and accelerated decline in commercial building.Reduced volumes of new work to replace completed projects contributed to a fall in employment for the first time in just over three years.UK construction firms frequently cited ongoing economic uncertainty as having a material negative impact on their order books. In particular, survey respondents noted heightened risk aversion and lower investment spending among clients, notwithstanding a greater number of speculative enquiries in anticipation of lower charges.
78;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T08:39:56Z;Pound slips on UK’s grim post-Brexit factory data;;A muted reaction from sterling this morningThe pound has edged down 0.2 per cent against the dollar to $1.32, giving up its gains this morning after a confirmed reading from the manufacturing sector showed output had fallen to its lowest level since February 2013 – worse than first expected.Sterling had been up 0.1 per cent against the dollar ahead of the release from Markit at 0930am BST.Last week, an earlier flash reading showed output had dropped at its fastest pace since the financial crisis.The headline number for July was worse than forecast, hitting 48.2 from an initial reading of 49.1. Sterling has now shed 11.5 per cent against the greenback since the referendum.
79;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T08:37:32Z;Post-referendum UK manufacturing PMI deteriorates;;Another sign of the post-Brexit loss in business confidence.Manufacturing activity deteriorated at an even sharper rate than initially recorded by Markit’s closely watched business survey in July according to figures out this morning.The UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 48.2 in July, down from an initial reading of 49.1. That’s the worst pace of contraction since early 2013. Levels above 50 indicate expansion.Last week, Markit said the initial reading showed “a dramatic deterioration in the economy” in the wake of the Brexit vote.On last week’s initial readings, the composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, plunged to 47.7, the lowest since April 2009.Regarding the further decline in manufacturing output, Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said today:The downturn was felt across industry, with output scaled back across firms of all sizes and across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors, although exporters did report a boost from the weaker pound.However, the improvement in exports was less marked than previously estimated, blamed in part on sluggish overseas demand. The downside of the currency was an upsurge in input price inflation to a five-year high on the back of rising import costs.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said this rise will be particularly painful for smaller businesses:Purchasing prices rose at levels not seen for half a decade, with SMEs bearing the brunt of rising input prices while larger corporates were more able to cope. And though export orders rose for the second month in response to the weaker pound, this was not enough to sustain the sector or make up any shortfall from the sluggish domestic market.Mr Noble said hiring deteriorated at the sharpest rate in three-and-a-half years, “as businesses chose redundancy and restructuring to secure themselves against more possible bad news ahead.”“Without new orders coming through, this downward trajectory is likely to get worse,” he added.The dramatic deterioration shown in last week’s flash readings prompted Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, to perform a U-turn on his monetary policy stance.In a speech two weeks ago he insisted the bank should wait “for firmer evidence” before delivering further stimulus. But in an interview with the Financial Times published last week, Mr Weale said the PMI data had convinced him of the need to act immediately.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
80;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T08:16:21Z;Eurozone manufacturing PMI weakened in July;;Eurozone manufacturing growth moderated in July, according to a closely watched business survey, a drop that was driven by contractions in France and Greece, as well as declines in growth in Italy and Spain.The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), produced by Markit, fell to 52 in July, down from 52.8 in June. Levels above 50 indicate expansion.There was a sharp divergence in performance across the trading bloc, with Germany, Austria and the Netherlands recording strong growth, while the outlook was weaker elsewhere.Here’s how countries scored in July:Although the headline figure was fairly strong, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warned:The problem is that growth is looking increasingly lop-sided, which will worry policymakers and add to calls for further stimulus from the ECB.Dig deeper beyond the headline numbers and more worrying pictures appear. Expansions in output and employment are clearly being driven to a large extent by surging growth in Germany, while growth has almost stalled in both Italy and Spain and contractions are being seen in France and Greece.Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics summarised:In one line: Decent, but weakness in the periphery is intensifying.France’s manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.6 in July from 48.3 in June. Although the overall contraction moderated slightly, there were further declines in production levels, new orders and employment. Staffing levels were cut for the fifth consecutive month.Jack Kennedy, at Markit, noted “continued fragility in incoming new orders.” He explained:This was reflected in ongoing cost-cutting measures, with payroll numbers and raw material purchasing reduced further and inventories declining again.Germany’s manufacturing PMI eased to 53.8 in July from a 28-month high of 54.5 in June.Digging into the details, Oliver Kolodseike at Markit struck an upbeat tone, noting:Production volumes grew at the fastest pace in over two years, fuelled by a combination of increased demand and the processing of backlogs. New business growth remained solid and manufacturers were encouraged to further raise their workforce numbers, partly in an attempt to raise capacity.There was also good news on the inflation front in Germany. Mr Kolodseike added:The ECB will be pleased to see that input costs rose for the first time in a year during July and selling prices stabilised, thereby adding to hopes that CPI will edge up in coming months. Higher steel prices and raw material shortages were the main drivers behind increased input costs, according to our panellists.
81;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T08:15:16Z;Greek factories fall back into reverse gear;;It’s nothing like the summer of 2015, but Greece’s manufacturing sector is back in the doldrums.The troubled debtor economy’s factory output contracted in July, according to Markit’s purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which slipped below the 50 mark separating boom from bust.July’s reading of 48.7 was the lowest since May and below the 50.4 hit in June. The declines were driven by an overall “deterioration in operating conditions in the sector” said Markit, as goods production fell, demand was subdued and total new orders fell for the 23rd straight month. Greece has also been hit by strikes at its two major ports in recent months.In slightly brighter news, July did see the fastest expansion in payroll numbers in nine years.July 2015′s reading, by contrast, was the worst ever recorded by Markit for any country since it began compiling the survey.Samuel Agass at Markit said: “With unfinished business still declining and stock levels being reduced further, the likelihood of growth occurring in the second-half of 2016 seems slim”.
82;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T07:51:22Z;Italian factories slump to lowest since Jan ’15;;There’s plenty of banking-based relief for Italy this morning, but Europe’s third largest economy is still stuck in a growth funk.Manufacturing output has fallen to its lowest level in 18 months in July, disappointing analyst expectations, according to Markit’s purchasing manager’s index (PMI) survey.The gauge hit 51.2 last month, down from a forecast of 52.5 and lower than June’s 53.5. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion, but July’s performance was the slowest expansion since January 2015.The declines were driven by falling new orders.“While employment at factories continued to rise, boding well for domestic demand, the outlook for hiring is less bright as manufacturers worked through their backlogs at a faster rate and, in general, the data showed the goods-producing sector losing momentum”, said Phil Smith, economist at Markit.
83;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T03:15:36Z;Exports a bright spot in cloudy outlook for South Korea, Taiwan;;Business activity in two of Asia’s top tech-focused exporters may still be growing, but a subdued global economic outlook cautions against too much optimism.In Taiwan, the Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers’ index for the manufacturing sector came in at 51 for July, up from 50.5 in June and marking a second month of expansion thanks to the strongest growth in new export business in 18 months.Meanwhile, the corresponding gauge for South Korean manufacturers read 50.1 last month, down from 50.5 in June and hinting at stagnation in operating conditions. But it, too, saw new export business grow at the strongest rate since January 2015, with falling domestic demand serving as the primary driver of contraction.In both countries inflationary trends were having a substantial impact on factories.For Taiwan, Markit economist Annabel Fiddes said a “sharp pickup” in inflationary pressures would remain of concern, as both consumers and companies saw the strongest prices increases in more than five years in July.South Korea saw the opposite, as Markit economist Amy Brownbill noted manufacturers had benefited from lower inflationary pressures that helped firms reduce their charges, “often as a result of negotiations with clients.”Whether it’s price pressures or slack demand, both countries will continue to face challenges in staying above the 50-point line separating growth and contraction, particularly if international demand falls substantially in the back half of 2016.
84;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
85;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-08-01T02:14:21Z;Japanese manufacturing shrinks for 5th straight month;;No cheer for Japanese manufacturers as the sector remained in deflationary territory for a fifth straight month.The purchasing managers’ index compiled by Caixin and Markit came in at 49.3 in July from 48.1 in June. The series had hit a historic low of 47.7 in May, as the effects of two large earthquakes in April became clear.Demand remained something of an issue, particular on the international front, with panellists saying that an appreciation in the yen (making exports less competitive) was a factor in keeping demand damp. They also cited terrorism and weaker demand from Europe.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, indicated it was a mixed scorecard for the month, given that the rate of contraction slowed from the previous month.Manufacturing conditions in Japan deteriorated at a weaker pace at the start of the third quarter of 2016. This followed the worst quarter in nearly three-and-a-half years.Both production and new orders declined at slower rates in July, while employment growth picked up slightly, albeit remained marginal overall.Meanwhile, the appreciation of the yen against the dollar had a mixed impact, with manufacturers benefiting from reduced imported raw material prices, although suffering from a sharp fall in new export orders as a result of weaker global competitiveness.
86;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-27T09:43:27Z;‘One last hurrah?’ Economists react to UK GDP;;"Britain’s economy grew by a better-than-forecast 0.6 per cent in the second quarter, in a sign of robust activity ahead of the UK’s referendum on June 23.Here’s fastFT’s round up of the best early reaction.Scott Bowman at Capital Economics finds that most of the upturn in growth was concentrated in April, two months ahead of the referendum, with evidence of slowing momentum towards the end of the quarter.These indices suggest GDP fell in May and ONS initial estimates for June imply that activity was flat in June. This sets a poor base for growth in Q3 and will be compounded by the uncertainty created by the vote to leave the EU.Early indicators of how the economy has fared since the Brexit vote have suggested growth could decelerate significantly in the third quarter – the first period of the year which will fully incorporate the fall-out from the referendum, notes Chris Williamson at Markit.Current indicators point to the economy turning down in the third quarter, though longer term prospects remain more uncertain. Markit’s flash PMI for July pointed to the steepest falls in the survey’s output, order books and future expectations indices on record.The headline PMI is now down to its lowest since April 2009; a level broadly consistent with GDP falling at a quarterly rate of 0.4%.Martin Beck at the EY Item Club says the the second quarter is likely to represent “one last hurrah for the economy” as output could well turn negative in the three months to September. But he thinks a “technical recession” – as warned by governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney ahead of the Brexit vote – could still be avoided:The lack of momentum as the economy entered Q3 means that the chances of a negative reading for the current quarter are relatively high.However, our view remains that the extent to which the economy will slow in the second half of the year has been overplayed and that the UK may avoid a technical recession.The better-than-expected figures will not throw the Bank of England off course, writes Samuel Tombs at Pantheon, who still expects an interest rate cut at the BoE’s latest monthly meeting next week. He writes:Meanwhile, the collapse in all surveys of activity and confidence undertaken since the referendum suggest GDP is on course to contract in Q3.The outlook for above-target inflation in 2017 and 2018, however, due to sterling’s depreciation, suggests that the MPC probably will just cut interest rates to 0.25% from 0.50%, and hold back from unconventional stimulus measures for now."
87;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-27T08:31:06Z;UK economic growth stronger than expected in Q2;;Britain’s economy much grew faster than expected in the three months leading up to, and including, the EU membership referendum, according to official estimates.GDP grew by 0.6 per cent between the beginning of April and the end of June compared to 0.4 per cent growth in the first quarter of the year.This compared to the average 0.5 per cent growth forecast from economists polled by Bloomberg. A poll of economists by Reuters signalled growth in the second quarter would remain steady at 0.4 per cent quarter on quarter.It won’t be until later in the year until official data start to show what has happened in the economy since the surprise victory for Leave campaigners at last month’s referendum.Although initial survey data hasn’t painted a pretty picture, today’s GDP estimate is likely to raise hopes that the effect on the economy could be less severe than some had anticipated.Commenting on today’s estimate, the Office for National Statistics said:Any uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect. Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses.A special set of purchasing managers’ indices – closely watched surveys produced by research group Markit – published last week suggested the UK economy suffered a “dramatic deterioration” after Britain’s vote to leave Europe. The composite PMI – which combines survey readings for the manufacturing and services sectors – fell to the lowest level since April 2009, when the UK economy was still struggling through the financial crisis.Economists noted, however, that the special Brexit PMIs could have reflected a sharp knee-jerk reaction to the surprise outcome to the vote and future surveys may pick up or stabilise.Responding to today’s second quarter GDP estimate, Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, said it was evidence the fundamentals of the UK economy are “strong”.He said:Today’s GDP figures show that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the second quarter of this year our economy grew by 0.6 per cent – faster than was expected. Indeed we saw the strongest quarterly rise in production for nearly twenty years, so it is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength.Those negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence.
88;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK manufacturing gloom deepens;CBI survey shows optimism falling on output, orders and jobs;Manufacturing growth is expected to slow over the next three months following the sharpest fall in company optimism since January 2009, according to the Confederation of British Industry.There are now as many manufacturers expecting orders to decline over the next three months as those expecting an increase, according to the CBI’s industrial trends survey of 506 companies, conducted between June 28 and July 13. This is the weakest outlook recorded since January 2012 when economic growth began to stagnate.The findings are consistent with the Markit/CIPS report published on Friday. This suggested the outlook for manufacturing — though weaker than before the EU referendum — was more positive than for the service sector, where optimism slumped to its lowest level since spring 2009, though remained much higher than the trough in 2008.Neither the CBI survey nor the Markit/CIPS data covered construction, which is expected to be hardest hit by Brexit. Markit data for this sector will be published in early August, providing the first concrete indication of how the sector is faring.The CBI data were collected before Theresa May was appointed prime minister. “It is still early days and the survey evidence so far could reflect an initial shock factor,” said Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. “We will have to wait a while longer before we get a clearer picture of just how big the immediate impact has been”.Manufacturers’ optimism about the next three months — in relation to total output, new orders and employment intentions — fell in July but only to around the average level seen since the data started being collected in 1995.One-in-five manufacturers expects the number of people they employ to fall over the next year, while 14 per cent expect an increase, giving a balance of -6 per cent. Though weaker than recent readings, this is still above the historic average of -12 per cent.Plans for new investment in buildings have also been scaled back. But manufacturers still plan to expand in other areas, such as training and innovation, over the next 12 months.One area of optimism was growth in export demand. There was a large increase in manufacturers reporting that economic and political uncertainty will limit export orders over the next three months. This measure jumped to its highest level since January 1983. But this was offset by a perceived improvement in UK international competitiveness following sterling’s recent depreciation. As a result, manufacturers on balance expect export orders to increase over the next three months.“Manufacturers picked up the pace over the second quarter, with output growing solidly,” said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist. But, she added, “a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over industry post-Brexit. We see this in weak expectations for new orders, a sharp fall in optimism and a scaling back of investment plans”.
89;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-25T10:14:31Z;UK business confidence drops to lowest since financial crisis after Brexit – CBI;;Optimism among the UK’s manufacturer’s has fallen dramatically in the wake of the UK’s vote to leave the EU, according to the latest quarterly survey from the Confederation of British Industry.Business confidence fell to -47 according to the CBI’s industrial trends survey, a severe decline from the -5 registered in April and far exceeding the -15 reading forecast by analysts. It is now at the lowest levels since the depths of the financial crisis in April 2009.The UK’s longest running survey of private sector activity, the CBI’s report also revealed falling export prospects, with industry recording a zero score for total expected orders over the next three months.But in a sign that the UK economy remained reasonably robust ahead of the Brexit vote, manufacturing output in the quarter ending July was stronger than that recorded in April.“Manufacturers picked up the pace over the second quarter, with output growing solidly”, said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, adding:But it’s clear that a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over industry, post-Brexit. We see this in weak expectations for new orders, a sharp fall in optimism and a scaling back of investment plans.The quarterly survey covers the general and export business situation, investment, capacity, as well as domestic and export order books.“Concerns over economic and political conditions abroad as a constraint on exports orders are at their highest level since 1983″, said the CBI.It comes after an influential survey of the UK’s private sector conducted by Markit also showed the steepest fall in output since the financial crisis in the wake of the Brexit vote.Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said: “The evidence is mounting that the economy has taken a hit from Brexit. But it is still early days and the survey evidence so far could reflect an initial shock factor.“We will have to wait a while longer before we get a clearer picture of just how big the immediate impact has been.”The dire set of purchasing manager’s surveys have helped send market expectations of a Bank of England rate cut in August surging to 88 per cent.
90;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T22:02:08Z;UK-exposed stocks sink on slowdown fears;But FTSE reaches highest in almost a year on overseas-oriented equities;Businesses most exposed to the UK economy fell on Friday as indications of a post-referendum slowdown started to appear in data releases.Retailer Marks and Spencer and banks including Lloyd’s were among the biggest fallers in the index following the release of the first UK composite purchasing managers’ survey by Markit.The survey, which tracks activity in manufacturing and services, fell by the most since the 2009 recession.M&S fell by 3.6 per cent to close at 316.8p while Lloyd’s finished at 54.5p, down 3 per cent on the day.Analysts at Barclays cut their price target for M&S to 290p from 410p.“The new management team’s strategy of focusing on customers and product may be the start of a turnaround story but things can get worse before they get better,” Barclays noted.Housebuilders also saw big declines. Berkeley Group fell by 2.3 per cent to £26.05 while Taylor Wimpey also fell 2.3 per cent to 146.9p.A property market analysis by Hometrack, which suggested that house price growth in London is set to slow added to the gloom for domestically exposed stocks and housebuilders in particular.LSL Property Services, an estate agent and surveyor, compounded the misery with a profit warning that led the company to close at 232.5p, down 6.3 per cent since the open.LSL said: “The EU referendum outcome has led to further consumer uncertainty and LSL’s post-referendum trading performance has reflected these market conditions.”Overall, the FTSE 100 rose by 0.5 per cent on Friday as declines in financial and consumer-oriented companies were outweighed by increases in the value of telecoms, miners and pharmaceutical stocks with revenues outside the UK.The two biggest winners were phone company Vodafone, which finished up 4.6 per cent to 235.6p after first-quarter results showed stronger than expected revenue growth, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, which rose by 2.7 per cent to £25.90.Pharmaceutical stocks in general did well. AstraZeneca closed up 2 per cent to £46.13 while GlaxoSmithKline rose by 1.3 per cent to finish at £16.60.For the week as a whole, the FTSE 100 gained 0.9 per cent in total to 6,730.48, its highest level in almost a year. The mid-cap oriented FTSE 250 gained 1.5 per cent to 16,983.46.Travel stocks suffered the most during the week because of the after-effects of the EU referendum, the botched coup in Turkey and terrorist attacks in France.EasyJet was the biggest faller this week and lost 9.9 per cent in total over the past five trading sessions.The company issued a profit warning on Thursday that said average revenue per seat had fallen about 7.5 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in the previous year. It continued its fall on Friday, losing 3.8 per cent to close at £10.27.
91;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T12:22:04Z;Eurozone economy shows resilience despite Brexit;PMI figures show only slight slowdown in pace of recovery;The eurozone economy is proving resilient to the fallout from Britain’s decision to leave the EU, new data suggested on Friday, even as signs of a downturn intensified in the UK.A closely watched poll of purchasing managers for the single currency area showed the pace of recovery slowing only slightly after the June 23 referendum.A separate European Central Bank survey of private sector forecasts also showed economists expect the British decision to have only a minor impact on the region.The purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone, compiled by data firm Markit, fell from 53.1 in June to 52.9 in July.While activity in the eurozone rose at the slowest pace in a year and a half, the decline was less pronounced than some had feared and the figure remains well above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.By contrast, Markit’s comparable figure for the UK plunged from 52.4 per cent in June to 47.7 per cent in July, the lowest reading since early 2009.“The eurozone economy showed surprising resilience in the face of the UK’s vote to leave the EU and another terrorist attack in France,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He added that the fragility of the region’s recovery left plenty of room for speculation about further stimulus by the ECB next year.Brexit could dent trade between the eurozone and the UK, while the British vote has also stoked concerns about the EU’s future cohesion, contributing to a steep fall in bank stocks in countries such as Italy and Spain immediately after the referendum.Some economists expect the eurozone’s monetary policymakers to unveil a fresh round of stimulus at their next policy vote in early September.The latest edition of the central bank’s quarterly poll of professional forecasters showed that economists expected growth in the single currency area next year to be 0.2 percentage points lower than previously thought and a tenth of a percentage point lower in 2018.Economists now expect on average growth of 1.4 per cent next year and 1.6 per cent in 2018, a revision that largely reflects the result of the UK referendum, the ECB said.While only 28 of the 51 economists polled said explicitly that they had taken the UK vote into account, their downgrades were only slightly bigger than those of other forecasters. Longer-term growth expectations remained at 1.7 per cent, while forecasts for this year were also unchanged at 1.5 per cent.Forecasts for inflation were also slightly lower, at 1.2 per cent for 2017 and 1.5 per cent for 2018 — from 1.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively. Longer-term inflation expectations and forecasts for this year remained at 0.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent.The forecasts contrast with inflation expectations based on market measures, which fell sharply following Britain’s vote to break ties with the EU.
92;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T11:42:58Z;Sterling extends losses after painful post-Brexit vote PMIs;;The pound has been on a one-way trip since some grim business surveys published this morning suggested a “dramatic deterioration” in the UK economy since Britons voted to leave the EU.The pound was up against the dollar before the purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) were published at 9.30am UK time on Friday, but dropped immediately after and has been extending its losses ever since.Sterling is now down 1.1 per cent against the dollar, its biggest drop in two weeks, at $1.3088.The PMIs, published by Markit, suggested the UK’s services and manufacturing sectors had both slumped into contraction territory in the wake of the referendum, with activity in the service sector at its lowest ebb since 2009, and manufacturing since 2013.Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, predicts sterling has further to fall in the wake of the “grim” PMIs:UK PMIs declined across the board indicating a significant post-Brexit weakening and signalling a potential economic contraction.Should the economic data continue to deteriorate, expectations for a more dovish BoE in August will weigh heavily on GBP. However, weakness in sterling could drive inflation expectations past the BoE target, and keep the central bank sidelined. Yet, in our view, inflation evolution is a low probability scenario. We remain bearish on GBPUSD, with upside capped by 1.3500, and target Brexit reaction lows at 1.2798.Steven Saywell at BNP Paribas adds:The combination of weak retail sales and the plummet in July PMIs gives considerable ammunition to the doves on the MPC who will push for significant easing in August. Market expectations are already turning more dovish for the August BoE meeting as seen by the 2-year swap spread between the UK and US (see chart), putting the GBP under renewed pressure. We remain short GBPUSD from 1.3350 targeting a move to 1.2800.Further readingUK economy suffered ‘dramatic deterioration’ after Brexit vote – MarkitUK post-Brexit referendum PMIs – economists reactBoE rate cut hopes jump after grim PMIs
93;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK post-Brexit referendum PMIs – economists react;;The first survey data carried in the aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the EU last month has suggested the economy suffered a “dramatic deterioration” in the wake of the referendum. If current trends continue, Markit, which produces the closely-watched survey, believes the UK economy could shrink by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter.Here fastFT rounds up some early economist reaction to the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) surveys.Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the PMI surveys boost the case “for a loosening in monetary policy in August”. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee held fire at its latest meeting last week but suggested most members expect policy to be loosened in August.Ms Gregory notes that given that the PMI surveys were carried out in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, there is a possibility they will stabilise or pick up in coming months “as the dust settles”. She adds:Nonetheless, the latest figures clearly reinforce the case for loosening monetary policy in August. Indeed, the composite PMI is now at a level that points, on the basis of past experience, to the MPC cutting interest rates by 50bp. But post-referendum indicators of activity are still thin on the ground. So this still may not be enough to sway those hawkish MPC members – who are looking for a clearer steer of the impact on the economy – into voting to loosen policy in August. Accordingly, while we are expecting a 25bp cut in Bank Rate in August (alongside a £75bn expansion of the QE programme), the vote will probably not be unanimous.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, notes that the composite PMI – the index that combines survey data for the manufacturing and services sectors – fell well below the crucial 50 mark that divides contraction and growth in 1998, 2001 and 2003 and the economy didn’t then go into recession. Today’s composite PMI dropped to 47.7 – the lowest reading since April 2009.However, Mr Tombs also points out today’s data could be “too sanguine”, as they don’t cover the UK’s construction industry which is arguably at the “sharp end” of any downturn in investment. Overall he believes the latest PMIs provide the “first major evidence that the UK is entering a sharp downturn”.Lucy O’Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management said:This paints a grim picture of the UK economy, with manufacturing and services dropping at their fastest pace on record into contraction mode. It’s important to remember that the survey covers a short and volatile period, but headline PMIs are generally reasonable indictors for what growth will look like. It will no doubt add fuel to the fire for those looking for a rate cut from the Bank of England in August and increase focus on the Autumn Statement – particularly given the Chancellor’s comments about the potential for resetting fiscal policy.Barclays’ economics team said the July “flash” PMIs – which will be replaced by “final” readings next month – are “consistent with an imminent recession”. But they include the important caveat:These estimates, however, are based on approximately 70% of expected responses. Fuller ‘final’ estimates will be released as per usual during the first week of August, and as such the ‘flash’ estimates may be subject to change.
94;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T08:33:39Z;UK economy suffered ‘dramatic deterioration’ after Brexit vote – Markit;;The UK economy has suffered a “dramatic deterioration” since Britain’s vote to leave the EU, according to a closely-watched survey of activity, which has slumped to a seven-year low.A special edition of the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a well-regarded survey of activity produced by research group Markit – has been published to provide a picture of how the UK economy has fared after the referendum. The picture is not pretty.The PMI survey for Britain’s powerhouse services sector – which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the economy – has dropped to a seven year low of 47.4 for July from 52.3 at the June survey. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. The outcome was far lower than economists’ forecast of a reading of 48.8.The manufacturing PMI has also dropped to 49.1 from 52.1 in June. The July reading is a 41-month low although economists had expected a slightly worse reading of 48.7.The composite PMI – combining both manufacturing and services readings – also fell dramatically to 47.7 from 52.4 previously against a forecast of 49. This is the lowest reading since April 2009, when the UK was struggling through the financial crisis.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:July saw a dramatic deterioration in the economy, with business activity slumping at the fastest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in early-2009.The downturn, whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations, a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects, was most commonly attributed in one way or another to ‘Brexit’At this level, the survey is signalling a 0.4% contraction of the economy in the third quarter, though much of course depends on whether we see a further deterioration in August or if July represents a shock-induced nadir. Given the record slump in service sector business expectations, the suggestion is that there is further pain to come in the short-term at least.Regular PMI surveys for Britain’s manufacturing, construction and service sectors have been published since the vote on June 23 but most of the responses were received before the referendum, leading Markit to produce today’s one-off “flash” Brexit PMI. Data for today’s survey was collected between July 12 and 21.Official data showing how the economy has fared since the surprise victory for Leave campaigners at last month’s vote will not start to emerge until next month.The Bank of England last week defied expectations of a rate cut by holding fire, although it indicated most members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee expected policy to be loosened in August.
95;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T07:39:10Z;Germany defies fears of post-Brexit slowdown to hit 2016 high;;Brexit? What Brexit?Europe’s economic powerhouse, Germany, defied fears of a Brexit-induced slowdown in July with economic activity hitting an “uninterrupted” seven-month high.A key gauge of private sector activity reported higher levels of new business, rising job creation and growing new export orders, with evidence of “particularly strong demand from foreign markets”.In its first set of post-Brexit referendum surveys, Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index – beat economists’ expectations to hit 55.3 in July, better than the 53.6 forecast ahead of the release.Output in Germany’s service sector powered ahead to hit a two-month high at 54.6 while manufacturing, despite slipping from June, also exceeded hopes with a reading of 53.7.The eurozone’s dominant economy “is continuing its uninterrupted growth trend at the start of the second half of 2016″, said Oliver Kolodseike at Markit:Strong tailwinds from a healthy labour market and rising demand are propelling the economy forward, while businesses so far seem to be unaffected by uncertainties around the UK’s decision to leave the EU.The news also underscores the gulf between Germany and the eurozone’s second largest economy France, which is still languishing in stagnation as manufacturing activity remains negative and services output was virtually flat in July.“The UK referendum result appears to have been a non-event in the eurozone business sector”, said Claus Vistesen at Pantheon.Later today, Markit will be releasing a one off post-Brexit flash PMI figure for the UK in a bid to capture an early snapshot of economic activity after the referendum.
96;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T07:07:34Z;French factories still ‘faltering’ – Markit;;Activity in France’s manufacturing sector is continuing to contract, according to survey data, but a closely-watched index of performance came in slightly higher than expected for July.The France manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a well-respected poll carried out by research group Markit – has remained below the crucial 50 mark that divides contraction and growth in July, but edged up to 48.6 from 48.3 the previous month. Analysts had expected a further move down to 48. July’s “flash” reading – a definitive reading will be published later in the month – represents a four-month high.The French services PMI is back above water, meanwhile. It has risen to 50.3 from 49.9 in June, exceeding economists’ expectations for a reading of 49.5.This pushed the composite PMI – which combines services and manufacturing – to 50 from 49.6 in June, a two-month high.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit said:The latest PMI data show a French private sector economy treading water at the start of the third quarter. A slight expansion of services activity again acted to offset a faltering manufacturing sector weighed down by falling new orders. However, a dip in services firms’ expectations to the lowest level so far this year suggests that the lacklustre trend in activity is likely to persist through the second half of 2016.
97;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-22T02:08:51Z;Japan manufacturing sector declines for 5th straight month;;Japanese manufacturers suffered a fifth month of contraction in June, albeit at a slower rate, according to a preliminary gauge tracking sector activity.The Nikkei-Markit “flash” manufacturing PMI came in at 49 in July, much improved from a finalised manufacturing PMI for June of 48.1 in June (revised upward from an initial reading of 47.8), but still well below the 50-point threshold separating contraction from growth.The industry has dropped off visibly in 2016, having spent only a month or two in contraction during each of the prior two years. A flash index for manufacturing output came in at 49.3, indicating the slowest contraction rate since March.Amy Brownbill, the Markit economist who compiles the PMI, said:The beginning of the third quarter signalled worsening operating conditions in the Japanese manufacturing sector. Both production and new orders declined, albeit at weaker rates than seen in June. Meanwhile, international demand fell at the sharpest rate in over three-and-a-half years, with many panellists blaming the appreciation of the yen leading to a reduction in global competitiveness.On a more positive note, the stronger yen/dollar rate helped to ease inflationary pressures as input prices decreased at the fastest rate since November 2009. Jobs growth also picked up, although was marginal overall.The Japanese Cabinet Office recently clipped its growth forecast for 2016 to 0.9 per cent from the 1.7 per cent projected in January, citing the government’s delay in raising consumption tax.
98;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-20T11:07:11Z;EC agrees deal with Isda, Markit over credit default swaps;;"European antitrust regulators are set to end a five-year long investigation into alleged collusion in the credit derivatives markets after agreeing a settlement with Markit and Isda, the two organisations that licence the industry’s main data and indices.The European Commission said on Wednesday it had extracted commitments from Markit, the UK data provider, and Isda, the derivatives trade association, to licence their intellectual property used to help price credit default swaps (CDS) to other organisations wanting to trade them, writes Philip Stafford.The settlement is likely to bring to an end to a lengthy investigation that had initially charged 13 banks, Isda and Markit for allegedly conspiring to block the possible development of credit default swaps trading on exchanges.The near-400 page charge sheet alleged collusion to ensure the insurance-like contracts remained an “over-the-counter” (OTC) product –preserving the banks’ lucrative role as middlemen. Credit default swaps provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to manage risk and bet on creditworthiness.Margrethe Vestager, Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said:Today’s decisions ensure that all trading venues can benefit from fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to data and intellectual property owned by Isda and Markit. This will translate into more choice and lower transaction costs for investors and will also increase market stability.The Commission has agreed a binding commitment from both Isda and Markit to exclude CDS dealers from taking individual licensing decisions, and prevent them from influencing such decisions.Both will offer fair and reasonable terms for their main products: Isda will license its proprietary rights to the so-called “final price” for a CDS contract for exchange trading; Markit will license its rights in the iTraxx and CDX indices it owns. The commitments will apply for ten years.The case built by Brussels suffered a major blow last December after it cleared 13 of the world’s largest investment banks – including Citigroup, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan – citing “a lack of evidence”. If guilty, they could have faced fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover."

With future prospects clouded by uncertainty, July data pointed to the worst financial outlook in two-and-a-half years
100;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-06T08:30:50Z;Italian retail sales drop to 31-month low – Markit;;A steep decline in retail sales in Italy – a nation normally renown for its love of shopping and fashion – has pushed the eurozone’s retail sector back into contraction territory, according to a survey of activity.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index for Italy’s retail sector slumped to a 31-month low for June, dragging an index covering the euro area as a whole to a two-month low and back into negative territory.The eurozone retail PMI came in at 48.5 for June, down from 50.6 in May. Any reading below 50 points to contraction.Markit said sales in Italy – which is fighting to stave off a crisis in its banking sector – have now fallen for six straight months.Italy’s prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he is willing to defy EU rules and pump billions of euros into the country’s banking system if it comes under severe distress. Italian banking stocks have come under renewed pressure after Britain’s vote to leave the EU, which has added to existing concerns over capital and bad loans in the sector.Phil Smith, economist at Markit said:The biggest talking point will be Italy’s sharp drop in sales, which contrasted with upturns across both France and Germany. Clearly consumer spending is on the wane in the eurozone’s third-largest economy after recent tentative signs of recovery. But it was a brighter picture for retailers in France, where back-to-back increases in sales were recorded for the first time in two years and employment edged higher. Germany remained the best performer overall, although sales growth there eased from the solid pace seen in May.
101;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-06T02:57:52Z;Hong Kong private sector contraction sharpens;;Sometimes a global financial hub just can’t catch a break. And no, we’re not talking about the City.The Nikkei purchasing managers’ index for Hong Kong’s private business activity came in at 45.5 in June, plunging farther beneath the 50-point mark separating contraction from growth and almost two points below a reading of 47.2 from the previous month.The sharpening fall is a painful setback after contraction had appeared to soften in May to the slowest pace of deterioration in 13 months.Overall activity was dragged down partly by a fall in new orders placed at private sector firms, which in June hit their lowest level since August 2015, when the headline gauge also hit a record nadir of 44.4.Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist responsible for compiling the survey, said the latest numbers signalled the current downturn had intensified at the end of Q2, with little hope for improvement in the near-term:Unless there is a marked improvement in customer demand, it seems unlikely that Hong Kong’s private sector will be able to lift itself out of the current downturn. However, given that global economic conditions continued to be dogged by uncertainty, including the recent announcement of Brexit, it’s likely that confidence and activity will fall further in the second half of 2016.That is discouraging news for Hong Kong, where gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank 0.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.
102;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-05T08:38:13Z;UK service sector growth in Q2 ‘weakest since 2013′;;Growth in Britain’s powerhouse services sector cooled significantly last month, according to the closely-watched purchasing managers’ index, and the industry suffered its worst quarter for more than three years.The services PMI – produced by research group Markit – fell to 52.3 for June from 53.5 the previous month – economists had expected it to drop to 52.8.Growth over the second quarter as a whole was the slowest since the first quarter of 2013, according to Markit. June’s reading matched April’s bleak number, which was a 38-month low.Markit said 89 per cent of responses to the June survey came in before the result of the referendum was known. The research group also highlighted that the 12-month outlook for the sector was the “darkest” since December 2012, writes Nathalie Thomas.The PMIs are among the first surveys to be published following the surprise victory for Leave campaigners at last month’s referendum and all data will be closely scrutinised by both sides of the political divide to test whether the Remain camp went too far with its warnings over the negative economic consequences of a Brexit vote, or whether it waged a pessimistic “Project Fear” as Brexiters have claimed.PMI surveys for Britain’s construction and manufacturing sectors, published in the last week, did not paint an overly optimistic picture, however. The construction PMI suggested the industry suffered its worst performance in June for seven years and fell into contraction territory. The manufacturing PMI showed a “modest improvement” in the run up to the vote but crucially 99 per cent of responses were received before Britons headed to the ballot box.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said UK GDP growth is likely to have cooled to 0.2 per cent in the second quarter from 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year. He said:The PMI surveys indicate that the pace of UK economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, with a further loss of momentum in June as Brexit anxiety intensified.Hiring has also clearly been hit as firms lack clarity on the economic outlook. Business optimism in the vast service sector is down to a three-and-a-half-year low.The services PMI is the most closely-watched of the three surveys given that the industry – which covers everything from retailers to banks and accountants – now accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the UK economy.
103;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-05T08:09:49Z;Eurozone Q2 GDP growth expected to cool to 0.3% – Markit;;Private sector companies in the eurozone ended the second quarter on a “disappointing” footing, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index, a well respected survey of activity.An improvement in the euro area’s manufacturing sector was outweighed by slowing growth in services.The eurozone services PMI dropped to 52.8 for June from 53.3 the previous month, although this was higher than an initial estimate of 52.4. The composite PMI – combining readings for the manufacturing and services sectors – therefore remained steady at 53.1 last month. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys, believes second quarter GDP growth cooled significantly to 0.3 per cent from 0.6 per cent in the first quarter. He said:The eurozone economy failed to gain momentum in June, rounding off a disappointing second quarter. Faster manufacturing growth was countered by a slowdown in the service sector, leaving the overall pace of expansion of business activity unchanged since May.The survey is signalling GDP growth of just 0.3%, similar to the sluggish trend recorded over the past year. The data suggest that the strong upturn seen in the official GDP data at the start of the year will have overstated the underlying health of the economy, and that growth will have slowed in the second quarter.Here is further detail on June PMI survey results for individual eurozone countries:
104;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-04T10:11:54Z;Property stocks knocked after weak construction survey;;Property and housebuilding stocks are crowding the bottom of the FTSE 100 after an influential survey suggested the UK’s construction sector suffered its worst performance in June since 2009.Although the FTSE 100 has recovered its poise after the UK voted to Leave the EU, construction and housebuilding stocks have remained under severe pressure (see chart below) as they are viewed as among the most vulnerable to a potential economic downturn in Britain.The latest construction purchasing managers’ index – a survey of activity produced by research group Markit – has done little to lift confidence, after it suggested output has fallen at the fastest pace for seven years, as investors postponed decisions until they were sure of the outcome of the referendum. Just over 80 per cent of the responses to the Markit survey were received prior to the vote so next month’s PMI will provide a clearer view of the situation post-referendum.British Land, Land Securities, Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 at publication time. Shares in British Land, which initially opened higher on Monday, are down 4 per cent, Land Securities is falling 3.95 per cent, Persimmon is off 3.64 per cent, Barratt is 3.66 per cent lower and Taylor Wimpey has dropped 3.37 per cent.Commenting on the construction PMI today, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit said:Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. However, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post-Brexit economic outlook.
105;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-04T08:33:09Z;UK construction output falls at fastest pace since ’09 – Markit;;Britain’s construction industry suffered its worst performance in June for seven years and has slumped into contraction territory, a closely-watched survey of activity has suggested, as the sector was rocked by uncertainty over the outcome of the EU membership referendum.The UK construction purchasing managers’ index dropped to 46 for June from 51.2 the previous month – economists had expected it to fall to 50.7. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Just over 80 per cent of responses were received before the result of the referendum, writes Nathalie Thomas.The fall in the PMI was triggered by a steep decline in residential building work while the commercial sector was also hit. The result is the worst PMI reading since June 2009 and the first time the index has fallen below the crucial 50 mark since April 2013.The data dented sterling, but only mildly. At pixel time, the currency is flat on the day, chipping away at earlier mild gains, at $1.3260.In one silver lining, Markit, which compiles the survey, highlighted that the rate of contraction was slower than seen during the financial crisis of 2008-09.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said:Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. However, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider postBrexit economic outlook.The construction PMI has been falling sharply this year – it had been as high as 57.8 in December – as investors delayed making decisions until they knew the outcome of the referendum.A number of commercial property deals have fallen through since the Leave campaign snatched a surprise victory at the end of last month while Foxtons, the London and South East-focused estate agent, issued a profit warning last week, saying that a hoped-for upturn in the market in the second half of the year is now unlikely to materialise.While the FTSE 100 has bounced back following the result, housebuilders and construction companies’ shares remain in the red. Persimmon’s shares, for example, have fallen 29 per cent since June 23, the day of the vote. Barratt Developments is also nearly 30 per cent lower – while Taylor Wimpey’s stock has also dropped 29.68 per cent.The PMIs are among the first surveys to be published since the referendum result and will be closely watched for signs of whether the referendum could tip the UK into recession or whether “Project Fear” was overdone, as Brexiters claim.The UK manufacturing PMI last week showed a “modest improvement” for June but crucially 99 per cent of survey responses were received before the referendum result. The construction and manufacturing industries are dwarfed by the services sector, which now accounts for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy. The services PMI will be published tomorrow.
106;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-01T08:19:27Z;Manufacturing PMIs: Germany jumps, France flops;;German manufacturing conditions leapt to a 28-month high in June, which contributed to an improvement for the eurozone overall to a high for the year.However, this was weighed down somewhat by another disappointing showing from France’s manufacturing sector, which remained firmly stuck in contraction territory. Meanwhile in the Nordics, manufacturing conditions in Norway nudged higher, but slipped in Sweden.Germany’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), as calculated by Markit, leapt to 54.5 in June, up from 52.1 in May and the highest level since February 2014.This is the fourth consecutive month-on-month rise in the PMI.Readings above 50 indicate expansion.Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the report said:Germany’s manufacturing engine shifted into a higher gear at the end of the second quarter. The sector was fuelled by a strong labour market, favourable economic conditions and rising demand from both the domestic and foreign markets, according to the survey results.With inventories of finished goods falling and both backlogs of work and new business growing, there’s a good chance that companies will continue to scale up production in coming months. Moreover, the fact that manufacturers raised their buying activity sharply supports the view that German industry will remain on an expansionary path, at least in the short term.The eurozone manufacturing PMI jumped to 52.8 in June from 51.5 in May, which indicated the strongest month of growth this year.It was a very different picture for French manufacturing, however.The French manufacturing PMI slipped yet again in June, dropping even further into contraction territory. It fell to 48.3 in June, down slightly from 48.4 in May.French manufacturing conditions have declined sharply during the course of this year, according to Markit’s PMIs. The last four readings have indicated contraction.Markit noted deteriorating orders, performance and job cuts. It said:Backlogs of work in the French manufacturing sector fell for a third successive month in June. Lower workloads contributed to a further round of job shedding in the French manufacturing sector during June. The latest fall in staffing levels was the fourth in as many months.Purchasing activity by French manufacturers decreased further in June, as firms responded to lower intakes of new work.Average delivery times on purchased inputs continued to lengthen in June. The rate of deterioration in vendor performance was more marked than in May, with some panellists commenting on low stock availability among a number of suppliers.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, added:French manufacturers reported another difficult month in June, with output falling further amid a sharper drop in new orders. A weak demand climate both domestically and externally continues to hold back the sector, with firms continuing to pare stock levels and cut employment in response.Meanwhile Sweden’s manufacturing PMI slipped in June for the first time in four months whereas the reading for Norway jumped to its highest level since January 2012.The manufacturing PMI for Sweden came in at 53, down from 54 in May and below the 53.8 reading forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg, according to data compiled by Swedbank and Slif.In Norway, the June reading was 53.5, up from 51.1 in May. It was the third straight monthly rise and a surprise improvement, as analysts had projected a dip to 50.5.The Norwegian economy bounced back to growth in the first quarter of the year, helped by recovering oil prices.Sweden in contrast, has seen its economy grow for 11 straight quarters, but this has created the challenge of a strengthening currency, which puts pressure on exporters’ earnings.
107;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-01T07:35:01Z;Spanish manufacturing activity clocks rise in June;;Spain’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), as calculated by Markit, jumped to 52.2 in June, up from a seven month low of 51.8 in May and ahead of economists’ expectations of 52.Readings above 50 denote expansion.Markit said:Production growth was supported by a further monthly rise in employment, with the rate of job creation broadly in line with that seen in May. Higher output requirements also led to a rise in purchasing activity, with the rate of expansion quickening to the sharpest since March.Input costs remained stable after increasing for the first time in nine months in May, although output prices declined for the twelfth consecutive month as the spectre of deflation still looms large over the eurozone.Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, said:While there was a positive sign from the latest Spain manufacturing PMI survey as output growth picked up, this was counteracted by a further slowdown in the pace at which new orders increased. It seems unlikely that production could continue to rise at the current pace should weakness in new business continue, and so firms will be anxious to see client demand pick up in coming months, particularly from domestic sources.
108;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-01T06:24:33Z;Russian manufacturing clocks quickest growth since 2014;;Russia’s manufacturing sector expanded at the quickest pace in 19 months in June, while new orders increased as the quickest pace in nearly two years.Russia’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), as calculated by Markit, jumped to 51.5 in June, up from 49.6 in May and its highest level since November 2014.Readings above 50 mark expansion.It is the first time the sector has expanded in seven months, having been mired in contraction as Russia’s economy struggles under the weight of weak oil prices and western-imposed sanctions.Economists had forecast a reading of just 50. Samuel Agass, economist at Markit, said:Russian manufacturers enjoyed one of their most prosperous months for almost two years in June, with expansions recorded in production, new order intakes and workforce numbers. Demand for Russia’s goods picked up as new order growth quickened to a 19-month high. However, the rise stemmed from the domestic market only, as new export orders contracted further. Similarly with production, the rate of expansion was the sharpest seen since November 2014.Encouragingly, goods producers looks intent on fuelling output growth. Staffing levels rose, albeit at a relatively subdued pace, in an attempt to support the strain from greater workloads, while manufacturers increased their purchasing activity at the fastest in three years in the face of a further marked rise in input costs. With backlogs also edging closer to stabilisation, Russia’s manufacturing sector could be set to shift into a higher level of growth over the second half of 2016.
109;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-07-01T02:48:49Z;Taiwan manufacturing activity rises as external demand steadies;;Factory activity in Taiwan ended a two-month streak of contraction last month as manufacturers reported improved operating conditions.The Nikkei Taiwan manufacturing PMI came in at 50.5 in June, popping back above the 50-point line separating growth from contraction and bouncing back from a seven-month low of 48.5 in June.Manufacturing output for the export-dependent country rose for the first time since March, and export sales saw a broad stabilisation in June, ending five months of reduction.Those figures stand in contrast to official and independent manufacturing sector gauges for China reported earlier today, with an explanation that ran alongside official figures blaming subdued activity in part on lower external demand.However Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist who compiles the survey data, cautioned against too much optimism:Driving the PMI higher was the first expansion of output in three months, alongside a slightly faster pace of job creation, suggesting that firms have become more optimistic towards the outlook.However, soft client demand continues to act as a drag on the sector, which has generally struggled to expand for much of the past year-and-a-half. Although new export sales stabilised over the month, thereby ending a five-month period of decline, unless there is a meaningful upturn in customer demand companies may start to think about restricting output and staff numbers.Taiwan’s central bank trimmed its benchmark rate on Thursday to 1.375 per cent from 1.5 per cent, amid heightened attention on central banks due to economic volatility in the wake of Brexit.
110;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;UK equity funds suffer heavy post-referendum outflows;;The vote to leave the EU took a heavy toll on UK equity funds, and global equity funds more broadly, as investors yanked funds out in the wake of the vote.On Monday UK equity funds suffered outflows of $350m, according to data from EPFR, the second largest outflow of the quarter, writes Joel Lewin. This was moderated by the fact that investors “moved to the sidelines ahead of the vote”, said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, with a net $2.8bn pulled out of UK equity funds between mid-April and mid-June.The outflows were also moderated by the fact that:A majority of those that remained appear to have heeded professional advice not to lock in the portfolio and foreign exchange losses that have accumulated in the wake of Thursday’s referendum.EPFR’s data shows that in the days leading up to the referendum, institutional investors bet heavily on a “remain” vote, while retail investors pulled out.Global equity ETFs suffered heavy outflows on the day of the vote and on the two days following it, during which $13.1bn was whipped out, according to Markit data. This coincided with a deep slump in global stock markets, which shed $3tn in just two sessions, the worst loss of market value on record.EPFR’s data suggests “mutual investors view the EU as the weaker of the two parties on either side of the ‘Brexit’ vote,” says Mr Brandt, pointing out that funds tracking German, Italian and Spanish equities have suffered far larger redemptions than funds exposed to the UK.This was reflected in stock market moves after the vote, which saw eurozone equities hit by steeper losses than UK stocks.The usual suspects have benefited from the post-referendum flight to safety- namely US and Japanese government bond funds, as well as gold, US investment grade corporate debt and real estate.Gold ETFs have continued to lure huge inflows, attracting $729m on Friday and $650m on Monday. In the first quarter they lured $12.8bn, and so far this quarter have attracted $8.6bn, the largest two quarters of inflows over the last six years, show Markit data.Charts courtesy of EPFR
111;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-23T08:12:12Z;German factories enjoy best month since early 2014;;What Brexit woes?Germany’s dominant manufacturing sector outstripped economist expectations in June, powering to record its best monthly performance since the start of 2014.Output in the sector, as measured by Markit’s purchasing manager’s index, rose to 54.4 this month, as international demand for German exports from the US and China recorded its best level in 24 months.The expansion was also better than the 52 expected by analysts (any marker above 50 indicates growth). Private sector companies surveyed by Markit reported a better international economic environment which lead to strong demand for German goods. New export orders rose at their best level in 2.5 years.But robust factory performance was not matched by a subdued month for services, where output fell to a 13-month low but still expanded with a reading of 53.2.Germany’s overall composite PMI hit 54.1, moderating from the 54.5 registered in May but enough to suggest Europe’s largest economy is “continuing its uninterrupted expansionary trend that started over three years ago”, said Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit.Having expanded by a bumper 0.7 per cent at the start of the year, June’s PMI figures suggests GDP will grow steadily again in the second quarter.“Today’s PMIs indicate that the cyclical momentum in the eurozone’s core economy remains strong, and that it is increasingly balanced between manufacturing/exports and domestic demand”, said Claus Vistesen at Pantheon.“The only dark spot for the private sector as a whole was that margins contracted as firms maintained selling prices, despite rising input costs due to higher commodity prices and higher wages”, he said.
112;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-23T07:16:30Z;French manufacturing falls to 16-month low;;Zut alors!France’s manufacturing sector has suffered its worst month since start of 2015 as the country is gripped by nationwide labour strikes this month.The health of manufacturing, as measured by Markit’s purchasing manager’s index, dropped to 47.9 – falling well below the 50 mark which indicates expansion. It is worse than the 48.7 expected by economists surveyed before the release.The contraction helped push France’s overall composite PMI down to 49.4 – a four month low for the eurozone’s second largest economy and its first negative reading since February.Services also fell below the 50 market to 49.9 from 51.6 recorded in May.The figures come as France has been gripped by more than a month of union-led public strikes and disruption as the country hosts the Euro 2016 football championships this month.Despite hosting the tournament, the private sector reported difficulty in securing employment in June, said Jack Kennedy, economist at Markit.“A flagging manufacturing sector was again the main source of weakness in the latest month, with the service sector broadly holding its ground,” he said.
113;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-23T02:19:15Z;Japan’s manufacturing sector shrinks steadily in June;;Japan’s manufacturing sector contracted in June for the fourth month in row, showing negligible improvement from May.Nikkei-Markit’s “flash” manufacturing PMI edged higher to a reading of 47.8 in June from 47.7 last month. That keeps it below the threshold of 50 that separates contraction from expansion.Japan’s manufacturing sector only saw activity contract in one month in 2015, and in just two months the previous year, so industry is going through a bit of a soft patch at the moment.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said the latest survey data point to a further deterioration in Japan’s manufacturing conditions.Both production and new orders declined at marked rates, led by a sharp drop in international demand. The earthquakes that occurred back in April still seem to be having a detrimental effect on the goods-producing sector, although uncertainty caused by negative interest rates could also be a factor. Consequently, employment growth eased to the weakest in nine months of expansion suggesting further stimulus may be needed in order to improve Japan’s economy.Japan’s southern island of Kyushu was hit by a series of earthquakes in April, which prompted concerns this could disrupt supply chains and crimp growth. Recent GDP data showed Japan’s economy posted solid growth in the first three months of this year, while other data suggested activity had been quite resilient in the wake of the April earthquakes.
114;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-20T15:56:13Z;Cost to hedge against UK market risk eases;;UK creditworthiness, as judged by investors, has been given a shot in the arm by Brexit referendum polls.The cost to insure the UK against default fell 6 basis points on Monday – the largest one day move since the depths of the eurozone crisis – as polls on the EU referendum showed the two camps running neck and neck, writes Elaine Moore.UK CDS rose sharply last week after it was reported that the Leave campaign had edged in front of Remain for the first time but fell back on Monday from 41 basis points to 35 basis points – or $35,000 to insure $1m of government debt annually for five years, according to data provider Markit.While few investors expect the UK to renege on its debt, the derivative contracts exist as a way for traders to express an opinion on UK creditworthiness and to hedge against market risk more broadly.All three of the world’s largest credit rating agencies have warned that a vote to Leave would have a negative impact on the UK’s credit score, with S&P warning that the UK could lose its final AAA rating.Fitch, which cut its rating on the UK to a notch below AAA level in 2013, said that leaving the EU would bring short-term disruption and long-term risks.
115;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-17T18:56:58Z;Investors bolster defences against European bond sell-off;;Trading activity in products that protect against falls in European corporate bond prices jumped above $50bn for the first time since March this week in a sign of rising investor angst ahead of the Brexit referendum next week.Volume on the Markit iTraxx Europe index, which tracks credit default swaps that rise in value as European corporate debt prices fall, rose to $54.4bn this week, according to Bloomberg data compiled at mid-day in New York. That is the highest level since the week of March 25, writes Adam Samson in New York.The price of the iTraxx index , which is often used by investors to protect against European market risk, also rose on Tuesday to its highest level since early March, although the cost had receded somewhat by the end of the week.The increased activity in the European CDS market is one of several signs in recent days of concern over the June 23 vote by UK citizens on whether the country should remain a member of the European Union.Indeed, data released on Thursday showed that UK equity funds faced redemptions of $1.1bn in the week to June 15, the second-sharpest outflow on record.“Markets are tense going into the EU referendum next week,” Morgan Stanley’s currencies team noted.
116;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-15T12:12:10Z;UK unemployment falls to decade low: economists react;;Britain’s robust labour market defied fears of a slowdown to chalk up another impressive fall in unemployment and jobs growth in the three months to April. Here’s what economists make of it all:With the headline unemployment rate now falling to 5 per cent – its lowest since October 2005 - and the number of employed people hitting fresh highs, the labour market seems to be showing no signs of a referendum-induced slowdown, says Ruth Miller at Capital Economics.However, behind the rosy picture, she notes that most of the rise in employment has come from self-employed people “which may not be a good thing if it reflects people struggling to find jobs”.Sonali Punhani at Credit Suisse adds that regular pay growth also rose to 2.3 per cent on an annual basis, with the monthly rise in April jumping from 1.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent in more good news for British workers:In the short term there has been an acceleration in the pace of wage growth, and after the weakness we saw a few months ago, wage growth is back on its trend since 2014. Regular private sector pay growth is running at a 2.7% annualized growth trend having grown at a pace of around 1% before that. This rise in wages is partly likely to be due to the introduction of the National Living Wage.Higher wages should also help drive along the UK’s consumer-driven economy, notes Chris Williamson at Markit:The improving labour market is helping support the economy via increased consumer spending. Separate survey data indicated that households enjoyed increases in both workplace activity and income from employment in June which, alongside low inflation, helped lift households’ views on their finances.Reduced labour market slack also suggests inflationary pressures will soon begin to pick up through higher wages.“With productivity growth stagnant, either growth will slow or wage inflation will pick up further – probably a bit of both”, said economists at Fathom.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon agrees, suggesting the first Bank of England rate rise since the financial crisis could well be on the way:Workers are extracting wage increases at the top end of what employers can afford. We continue to expect wage growth to increase and to average nearly 3 per cent in the second half of this year, as inflation rises and the labour market continues to tighten. Unless productivity growth suddenly accelerates, this should provide the basis for an interest rate increase just before the end of this year.But even if the UK decides to stay in the EU, Sam Hill at RBC thinks a rise in interest rates is still way off the cards, coming in the later part of 2017:The bottom line is that despite slightly better than expected numbers for April, wage growth is still too modest at current rates to expect the MPC will feel the need to start putting Bank Rate up in the aftermath of a Remain vote. If the first hike in Bank Rate doesn’t come in February 2017 as we forecast, the likelihood is it will be later rather than earlier.
117;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-10T16:41:35Z;European stocks having worst day since Feb;;European stocks are having their worst day since February, falling heavily as investors whip money out of the region’s equity funds for the 18th consecutive week.The Eurofirst 300 and FTSE 100 have fallen 2.35 per cent and 2 per cent respectively today, which puts both of them on track for their biggest one-day drops since early February as concerns over Brexit and negative bond yields weigh.Bank stocks are leading the slide, with the Stoxx 600 bank index dropping 4.2 per cent, its biggest daily decline in 17 weeks, writes Joel Lewin. The decline takes the index’s loss to more than 25 per cent so far this year.Greece’s Eurobank has been the hardest hit by Friday’s sell-off, dropping 10.5 per cent, while Italy’s Unicredit has shed 6.4 per cent amid reports it will not appoint a new chief executive until July, and Deutsche Bank is falling 4.8 per cent.Sentiment towards the sector has not been helped by the renewed plunge in bond yields over the past week, which has coincided with the start of the European Central Bank’s latest policy experiment- corporate bond buying, and refocused concerns on the impact of negative interest rates.The ECB has already bought debt worth about €1.1trn and cut interest rates deep into negative territory, helping to haul German Bund yields, as well as Gilt and Japanese government yields, to new record lows this week.This has sparked a fresh bout of concern over the earnings of financial groups, and a warning from Bond King Bill Gross that the world’s $10tn pile of negative-yielding government bonds is a “supernova that will explode one day”“It’s a bit frustrating the ECB is reducing the strength of the financial system,” Jean Medecin, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac Gestion tells fastFT.“We have been absent from eurozone bank stocks for quite a long period of time now,” he adds.Even though Europe has been supported by a flurry of favourable circumstances over the last year, including lower oil prices, a weaker euro and interest rate cuts, growth is still languishing around 1.5 per cent, he says.Soon “those tail winds may transform into headwinds”, which “will really effect the momentum of the economy,” and potentially dent equities, he warns.In addition, oil prices are sliding today… oh, and then there’s Brexit. How could we forget?Didier Saint-Georges, another member of Carmignac’s investment committee, warns a vote to leave the EU:would at the very least present a serious threat of disruption to growth and inter-European trade… and at worst, could trigger a chain reaction. This is because any vote to break away from the past would set a major precedent that would boost, and even give legitimacy to, other anti-establishment or anti-European votes.Friday’s sell-off comes as new data showed European equity ETFs suffered their 19th consecutive week of outflows, putting them on track for a record quarterly outflow with most of the month to spare. Year-to-date $18.8bn has poured out, compared with an inflow of $49.9bn in the same period last year, according to Markit data.
118;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-03T08:38:15Z;UK growth could cool to 0.2% amid Brexit jitters;;Britain’s services sector recovered slightly last month after an index measuring activity hit a 38-month low in April but the rate of growth was still one of the weakest seen over the last three years, according to a closely-watched survey.The latest purchasing managers’ index for the UK’s dominant services industry edged up to 53.5 in May from 52.3 the previous month, which was the lowest reading since February 2013. May’s outcome was also better than the forecast of 52.5 expected by economists. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, writes Nathalie Thomas.But Markit, which produces PMI surveys, said the pace of growth remained “subdued” and provides further evidence that economic expansion in the UK is likely to have cooled significantly in the second quarter, to just 0.2 per cent, as uncertainty around the outcome of the EU membership referendum puts the brakes on investment. The UK economy expanded by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, which was itself a slowdown in growth from the pace of 0.6 per cent recorded in the final three months of last year.The uninspiring UK services PMI follows lacklustre surveys for the construction and manufacturing sectors. The construction PMI, published yesterday, suggested new orders had fallen for the first time since April 2013.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:The PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as ‘Brexit’ worries exacerbated existing headwinds. The data so far indicate that the second quarter is likely to see the economy grow by just 0.2%.Growth has collapsed in manufacturing and construction, leaving the economy dependent on the service sector to sustain the upturn, though even here the pace of expansion has remained frustratingly weak so far this year.However the survey detected a fairly positive outlook from most services companies, although whether they maintain that optimism will hinge on the outcome of the referendum on June 23, Markit said.The services industry accounts for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy.This week’s PMI surveys will be the last before the referendum later this month.
119;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-03T08:07:49Z;Eurozone PMIs ‘point to Q2 growth of 0.3%’;;European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned that growth in the euro-area may possibly cool in the second quarter and the latest purchasing managers’ survey data so far appear to be supporting that suspicion, despite consumers powering the bloc’s services industry.A final reading of the well-regarded purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone for May came in at 53.1. Although this was better than a preliminary reading published last month of 52.9 and a reading of 53 in April, Markit, which produces the surveys, said growth “remained subdued”. The rate of expansion achieved so far in the second quarter is a “touch below” the previous three months, Markit said.The composite PMI combines services and manufacturing surveys.The eurozone services PMI came in at 53.3 for May compared to a “flash” reading of 53.1 and flat on the previous month. But the manufacturing PMI edged down to 51.5 last month from 51.7 in April, giving rise to a warning by Markit that eurozone factories are stuck in a state of “near-stagnation”.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said:The final PMI numbers for May have come in slightly ahead of the earlier flash readings, but still point a eurozone economy which seems unable to move out of low gear.The survey data are signalling a GDP rise of 0.3% in the second quarter, suggesting the growth spurt seen at the start of the year will prove frustratingly short-lived.He also cautioned there was unlikely to be a significant pick-up in June:June looks likely to prove equally disappointing, as inflows of new business slowed in May to the weakest for almost one-and-a-half yearsThe performance of individual member states varied considerably in May, with a shock result from Italy’s services sector in particular. Here are some key points from today’s releases:Mr Draghi said at a press conference yesterday, following the ECB’s latest monetary policy decision, that growth in the second quarter may possibly be “at a lower rate than in the first quarter”, when GDP expanded 0.5 per cent.
120;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-03T08:07:42Z;Italian services clock first contraction in 17 months;;Italy’s services sector slipped into contraction for the first time in 17 months in May, raising concerns that the country’s economic recovery has slowed in the second quarter.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the service sector fell to 49.8, down from 52.1 in April and well below the 51.5 expected by economists. Readings below 50 denote contraction.It’s the first time the PMI has slipped into contraction since December 2014, and a number of managers reported “the recovery [is] failing to gain traction” and demand is softening.The rate of job creation was weaker than the eight month average, and Markit noted “the overall degree of optimism signalled was the lowest since August 2015”.The average prices charged by Italy’s service providers continued to contract, a trend that runs all the way back to August 2011.“Anecdotal evidence suggested that companies lowered output prices due to competitive pressures and attempts to stimulate new business”, said Markit.Backlogs of work also continued falling in May “posing further downside risks to business activity and employment in coming months”.In April, Italian unemployment unexpectedly jumped to a nine-month high, a further indication of pressure on the country’s economic recovery.Phil Smith, economist at Markit, said:The latest PMI data raise the likelihood of Italy’s economic recovery slowing in the second quarter. Activity fell slightly across the vast service sector in May, which coincided with a slowdown in manufacturing output growth to a three-month low.
121;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-03T07:29:55Z;Spain’s roaring services drive economy ahead of elections;;More good news for Spain.The eurozone’s fourth largest economy has notched up another robust month of growth in its dominant services sector, beating economist expectations in May.Output in services hit 55.4 last month, better than April’s 55.1 and exceeding a forecast of 54. Any number above 50 indicates expansion in the purchasing manager’s index (PMI) survey conducted by Markit.Transport and storage was the best performing sub-sector, while the country’s hotels and restaurants also posted strong increases in output prices. Inflationary pressures are good news for the economy which has been stuck in deflation since mid-2014.The robust health of the services sector will come as welcome news after the country’s manufacturing industry has slipped into stagnation. Output in Spanish factories ground to a halt in May, with economists warning of a “protracted slowdown”.Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said the services performance will come as a “relief” for the country, which has been without a government for the last seven months:The figures provide hope that the sector will be able to successfully weather headwinds such as a weak global environment and domestic political instability and remain in growth territory in the near-term at least.”Spain is also finally making inroads in tackling its mass unemployment problem ahead of new elections on June 26. Last month, the number of jobless Spaniards dipped below 4 million for the first time since the start of the country’s debt crisis in 2010.
122;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-03T02:51:33Z;Hong Kong private sector shrinks at slowest pace in 13 months;;Sometimes bad news is the good news, particularly after 15 straight months of contraction.The Nikkei purchasing managers’ index for private business activity in Hong Kong came in at 47.2 in May, still painfully far beneath the 50-point mark separating contraction from growth but almost 2 percentage points above the somewhat more harrowing depth of 45.3 from the previous month.The softening of headline contraction is not the first such improvement since the gauge of business activity hit a nadir of 44.4 in August 2015, but it does mark the slowest pace of deterioration in 13 months. The survey results are the first since Hong Kong reported GDP shrank 0.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist responsible for compiling the survey, greeted the softer fall with caution:As global economic conditions remain unfavourable and client demand remains weak, it’s likely that private sector companies in Hong Kong will continue to see business conditions deteriorate in the coming months. The next releases of PMI data for the region will, however, give a steer as to whether the extent of the downturn softens further as we head into summer.Both output and new orders shrank at a slower rate in May, prompting “only a marginal reduction in staff numbers,” as per Nikkei’s description, leading the headline figure higher. Sharp weakness in demand from mainland China also dulled somewhat, as new work from across the border declined at the softest rate in over a year.But prices charged fell still further as companies reported greater competition for new businesses and a minor rise in staffing expenses running opposite a marginal fall in input costs.
123;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-02T08:40:11Z;UK construction: new orders drop for first time in 3 years;;We are definitely not the builders at the moment.New orders in Britain’s construction industry have fallen for the first time since April 2013 as customers delay decisions until they know the outcome of the EU membership referendum, according to a closely-watched survey of activity.Output is also hovering near three-year lows, Markit’s construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) shows. The PMI has fallen further to 51.2 for May, after tumbling to 52 the previous month, which was the lowest level since June 2013, as weaker economic growth knocked confidence in the industry, writes Nathalie Thomas.UK GDP growth slowed to 0.4 per cent in the first three months from 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and there are concerns growth will slow further as uncertainty around the outcome of the Brexit referendum causes some companies to postpone investment and consumers to rein in spending.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said:Survey respondents noted that the forthcoming EU referendum has disrupted new order flows and the timing of client decision making in particular. Heightened uncertainty and subdued general economic conditions in turn contributed to the first outright fall in new work received by construction firms for just over three years.However it was’t all doom and gloom, Mr Moore added, highlighting that employment in the sector remains healthy – for the moment at least.The main positive aspect was a pick-up in staff hiring to its fastest since the beginning of the year. Positive employment trends not only contrasted with falling new order volumes in May, but the gap between these indices was the largest since the survey began in 1997.An optimistic interpretation is that construction firms are looking through the second quarter weakness and feel that workloads will recover momentum. However, should this fail to materialise later in 2016, then job creation is likely to come under pressure given its elevated trend relative to current demand patterns.The construction PMI has fallen sharply since December last year when it was at 57.8.A similar survey for the UK’s manufacturing industry yesterday showed an improvement in output for May following a sharp plunge into contraction territory the previous month but Markit cautioned there were signs the EU referendum was weighing on investment spending in that sector too.
124;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T08:39:03Z;UK factories fight back – Markit;;British manufacturers fought back last month with the help of strong demand for consumer goods, pushing a keenly-watched gauge of activity back into growth territory, but there are signs that investment could slow around the UK’s EU membership referendum later this month.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index for the UK manufacturing sector rose to 50.1 for May from a reading of 49.2 in April. Economists had been expecting a slight improvement to 49.6.Last month the PMI slumped to its lowest level since March 2013 and below the 50 mark that divides contraction and expansion.May’s survey was boosted by robust demand for consumer goods. But Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, expressed caution over this month’s positive number:The manufacturing sector continued its lacklustre start to 2016. Although key indicators for output, new orders and the headline PMI all ticked higher in May, the latest survey is still consistent with around a 0.8% quarterly decline in the official ONS Manufacturing Production Index. The sector will therefore remain a drag on broader economic growth, adding pressure on the service sector to sustain the upturn in GDP.He added:Although the domestic market remains positive for manufacturers, especially for producers of consumer and intermediate goods, softer global growth is weighing on new export orders. There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum is weighing on investment spending. Manufacturers will have to wait and see whether this trend improves in the coming months.A number of recent surveys have suggested UK economic growth is continuing to slow ahead of the EU membership referendum later this month. GDP growth in the first quarter slipped to 0.4 per cent from 0.6 per cent in the closing three months of 2015.Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s has today warned that a vote to break ties with the European Union would potentially “paralyse” investment in the UK.Sterling has been rattled over the last few days by a number of polls suggesting public sentiment is starting to move towards exiting the EU.
125;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T08:07:57Z;Eurozone factories stuck in ‘slow growth’;;Manufacturers in the eurozone are still stuck in “near stagnation”, according to a closely watched survey of activity.The final reading of May’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for eurozone manufacturers – produced by research group Markit – was unchanged from a “flash” estimate published last month of 51.5 but this was down from 51.7 in April.May’s survey was still above the 50 mark that divides contraction and expansion but Markit’s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the sector is struggling to break out of a “slow growth” phase.The latest data are likely to support suspicions that GDP growth in the euro area has cooled from the 0.5 per cent pace of expansion recorded in the first quarter. He said:Manufacturing in the euro area remained stuck in a state of near-stagnation in May, failing to break out of the slow growth phase that has plagued producers since February.The disappointing performance of manufacturing adds to suspicions that the pace of eurozone economic growth in the second quarter has cooled after a surprisingly brisk start to the year based on the latest estimate of GDP.As usual, there was a mixed bag across the continent. Here are a few key points from this morning’s PMI releases:
126;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T07:31:16Z;‘Not a blip’: Spanish manufacturing misses forecasts;;Spanish manufacturing is still growing, but not at its previous pace, and not as fast as expected.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index for the sector, a broad measure of health including orders, employment and prices, just came in at 51.8 for May, from 53.5 in April and behind the 52.5 reading that economists had predicted.At over 50, the sector is still expanding. But as Markit points out:The latest improvement was the weakest in seven months amid slower rises in output, new orders and employment.Andrew Harker at Markit said:The Spanish manufacturing sector moved closer to stagnation in May, according to the latest PMI release, suggesting that the current period of expansion could be coming to an end.The rate of growth in new business has now eased in four successive months, suggesting we are seeing a protracted slowdown rather than a temporary blip.More from Markit here.
127;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T06:16:42Z;Russian manufacturing almost out of contraction;;Russia’s manufacturing sector contracted at the most moderate pace in four months in May, according to Markit’s latest purchasing managers’ index, underscoring the industry’s tentative oil-driven recovery.The index rose to 49.6 in May, the highest level since January. That’s a sharp jump from 48 in April, and well ahead of economists’ expectations of a reading of 48.5. Readings above 50 denote expansion.Russia’s manufacturing sector has been buoyed by the recovery in oil prices, which have surged more than 80 per cent since touching its lowest point in over a decade in January. Last week Brent broke $50 per barrel for the first time in six months.But nonetheless, Russia’s manufacturing sector remained in contraction for the sixth consecutive month, and has only managed two months of expansion out of the last 18.Samuel Agass, an economist at Markit said “the latest reading suggested that conditions were moving closer to stabilisation.”He added:Although falling demand for Russian goods remains a worry for policymakers, output returning to expansion territory and workforce numbers increasing, albeit in each case only marginally, highlights that the worst may have passed. Also, with input buying rising at the fastest pace for 18 months, companies look set to boost production in coming months if new orders pick up.(Chart: Bloomberg.)
128;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T04:50:40Z;Vietnamese manufacturers buoyed by influx of new orders;;Vietnamese factories paid little heed in May to apparently tepid growth elsewhere in the region as new orders rose at their fastest rate in a year.The Nikkei-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for Vietnam rose to 52.7 in May, notching a 0.4 percentage point gain over April’s reading and rising further above the 50-point line separating expansion from contraction.Accelerating growth in the headline measure of factory activity was driven by faster expansion of both output and new orders, with the latter rising at the quickest clip in twelve months.As factories responded to increasing demand in May employment levels also rose, though at a slower pace than in April – as was also the case with new export orders.Input prices also jumped to their fastest rate since August 2014, but while prices for finished goods saw their second straight month on the rise, factory-gate inflation remained modest. Andrew Harker, the senior economist at Markit who compiles the index, said that could change:It is becoming clearer that the recent period of deflationary pressure has come to an end, but Vietnamese firms have so far been able to restrict the extent to which they have raised their output prices. This could change should the rate of cost inflation continue to build.
129;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T04:26:46Z;Consumer inflation steadies in Indonesia;;Prices of consumer goods in Indonesia hit the mark in May as inflation held more or less steady from the previous month.Consumer inflation rose 3.33 per cent year-on-year in May, just above economists’ consensus forecast of 3.3 per cent and steadying after a dropping 0.85 percentage points in April to 3.6 per cent, according to Statistics Indonesia.Core inflation – which strips out jumpy food and administered prices, including subsidised fuels and electricity billing rates – was up 3.41 per cent, unchanged from the previous month and in line with expectations of 3.43 per cent.A Markit/Nikkei purchasing managers index published earlier today indicated input costs for manufacturers had also risen in May at the sharpest rate this year – though still well below the inflationary peaks seen in 2015.
130;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-06-01T03:42:41Z;Indonesia factory activity growth softens;;Growth slowed in Indonesia’s manufacturing sector in May only a few months out from a stretch of contraction that had lasted almost a year and a half.The Nikkei-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for Indonesia fell back to a reading of 50.6 in May, 0.2 percentage points closer to the 50-point line delineating expansion from contraction compared to the previous month.Although new orders rose for a third straight month in May, order growth was slower, and a sub-index for output dropped to 50, reflecting no change in output from April. Orders from abroad fell for the twentieth consecutive month, albeit at a somewhat slower rate.Input costs also rose, reflecting the sharpest rate of inflation producers have faced this year – though still well below the peaks seen in 2015. (Official inflation data are due out some time today.)Even so, the latest reading was far better than this time a year ago, when manufacturers in Indonesia were struggling to claw their way back from an all-time low reading of 46.4 that March.Despite last month’s fall-back in activity growth, Pollyanna De Lima, the Markit economist who compiles the index, pointed to signs that conditions are improving:May’s stagnation in output is unwelcome news, given that manufacturers have only recently seen the end of a prolonged sequence – 17 months – of contraction in production. Total new orders rose at a weaker pace than in April, while external demand continued to fall. The outlook, however, appears encouraging as businesses continued to take on additional workers and scaled up their buying activity to the greatest extent since July 2014, suggesting that a pick-up in demand is expected.
131;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-27T09:04:48Z;Squashing of the gold bugs runs into week 4;;Poor gold bugs.Things have turned sour quickly for the shiny stuff. Gold prices have fallen for the last four consecutive weeks, sliding more than 5 per cent as a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve has put a June rate rise back on the cards, writes Joel Lewin.It’s a rapid change of fortunes for what was the world’s best performing major asset class in the first quarter. Gold surged 16 per cent in the first quarter, its best since 1986.Market turmoil had pushed expectations of a Fed rate rise way back, boosting non-yielding assets like the yellow stuff. Declining rate rise expectations also hammered the dollar, which gave a boost to dollar-denominated assets like gold.A series of hawkish statements from Fed officials, which culminated in last week’s meeting minutes, pushed market expectations of a June hike from 4 per cent to 30 per cent.But even sliding prices haven’t halted flows into gold exchange traded funds.After investors pumped $12.4bn into gold ETFs in the first quarter, the biggest inflow since 2009, there was a brief pause in April. But over the last four weeks $4.5bn has flowed in, according to Markit data, suggesting some investors think the rally could resume eventually.“Short-term weakness in gold should be viewed as an opportunity to build strategic positions,” says Joni Teves at UBS.“Many market participants over the past few months have expressed interest to buy a dip in gold – this is now the time to see whether those intentions would be or are being translated into action,” he says, adding:positions being put on this year are strategic in nature, and as such we would expect interest to hold some gold as a hedge against uncertainty would still be intact. This suggests that those who had missed the move in January, and were unwilling to chase the market, should now have the opportunity to build gold exposure at more attractive levels.Georgette Boele at ABN Amro suggests gold will rebound. She says the Fed is unlikely to raise rates this year, which will weigh on the dollar and boost gold, as will a likely pick up in inflation. She writes:All in all, we continue to be positive on the outlook for gold prices. For a start, we think that the multi-year US dollar rally has come to an end and the recent recovery is just temporary in our view. Moreover, we expect US real yields (taking into account inflation expectations) to peak and to move lower. This will make gold as an asset attractive. In addition, gold’s price is relatively attractive compared to other assets with safe haven attributes.
132;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
133;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK economy grows 0.4 per cent in Q1;;The UK economy grew by 0.4 per cent at the start of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics, confirming an earlier flash estimate for GDP performance in the first quarter.It is the slowest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2015. Annualised growth was however revised down to 2 per cent from an earlier flash estimate of 2.1 per cent, writes Mehreen Khan.Services, the main driver of the British economy, grew at 0.6 per cent from January to March, but industrial output and construction both saw output decline 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.Accounting for around six per cent of the economy, construction has been in the doldrums of late, with the 1 per cent decline higher than an initial 0.9 per cent fall calculated by the ONS last month. Manufacturing output also fell 0.4 per cent, delivering another blow to the Government’s hopes of rebalancing the UK economy away from a reliance on services.“The recovery is perilously dependent on consumers”, said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon.The pace of growth is set to deteriorate further in the second quarter, said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit.“The disappointing start to the year suggests the economy will struggle to attain 2 per cent growth this year without a substantial rebound in the second half of the year, which in turn will of course largely depend on the EU referendum.”But not all Britain’s woes this year can be attributed to the looming “Brexit” vote said economists.“Household real income growth is fundamentally slowing as job growth moderates, the fiscal consolidation intensifies and inflation revives”, said Mr Tombs.
134;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-23T20:05:18Z;US stocks drift lower in light trading;;The S&P 500 sputtered on Monday, with trading volume on the Big Board running about 25 per cent below the 30-day average, as investors eyed a smattering of corporate news.The materials sector stole the spotlight on the benchmark S&P 500, rallying 1.2 per cent, as Monsanto got a bid after Germany’s Bayer offered to buy the US agribusiness group for $62bn and CF Industries rallied after the US fertiliser company said it would ditch its planned buyout of the European and North American operations of Dutch rival OCI.On the other end of the spectrum, the utilities sector struggled after sliding more than 2 per cent last week as rising expectations for a rate rise by the Federal Reserve this summer put pressure on the group that is seen as a bond alternative because of its consistent dividend streams.Elsewhere, on the economic front, investors got a disappointing report on the US manufacturing sector from Markit, which showed factory growth nearly stalled this month. The continued struggle for manufacturers underscores the complexity of the decision faced by policymakers on when the Fed should raise interest rates.In commodities, US crude oil prices dipped by 0.7 per cent to $48.08 a barrel.The US dollar slipped by 0.1 per cent against a basket of six global currencies, but the greenback is set for its biggest monthly rise in half-a-year.
135;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-23T13:03:47Z;Poll points to eurozone growth slowdown;Purchasing managers’ index dips to 16-month low;The eurozone’s pace of growth may be slowing after a rapid recovery at the start of the year, according to a closely watched poll.The purchasing managers’ index, which is compiled by Markit, the data provider and used by officials across the region to monitor the direction of economic activity, dipped to a 16-month low of 52.9 in May — down from 53 in April.While PMI remains above the 50 level that marks an expansion in activity, the downward trend raises doubts about the strength of the recovery in the 19-member single currency area.The data are based on surveys of variables such as output, new orders and employment at thousands of companies and shows new business growth at its lowest level since the beginning of last year.The figures contrast with relatively strong recent performances by France and Germany, the eurozone’s two biggest economies, and may indicate diverging fortunes between the region’s core and peripheral economies such as Italy, Spain and Greece.Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics, said the data provided “little evidence that another strong quarter of growth was on the cards in the second quarter”.However, the figures underestimated the pace of expansion recorded in the first quarter. In March, Markit’s economists estimated growth for the period of 0.3 per cent — lower than the 0.5 per cent figure recorded by Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics bureau.In France, activity in May rose at its fastest pace in seven months, as rapid growth in the dominant services sector compensated for the decline in manufacturing.“There are signs of improving life in the ‘core’ countries of France and Germany, led mainly by their service sectors, as manufacturing continued to struggle. However, elsewhere the rate of expansion slowed to its weakest for almost one-and-a-half years,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.He added: “The survey therefore paints a picture of a region stuck in a low-growth phase, managing to eke out frustratingly modest output and employment gains despite various European Central Bank stimulus ‘bazookas’, a competitive exchange rate and households benefiting from falling prices.”The ECB cut rates to a record low in March and expanded its bond-buying programme, dubbed quantitative easing, by €20bn a month to €80bn.
136;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-23T08:09:40Z;Eurozone PMI hits 16-month low;;The eurozone economy may have expanded at a decent pace of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year but the latest survey data are pointing to a slowdown in growth in May.A preliminary reading of the eurozone purchasing managers’ index, published on Monday, suggested the closely-watched gauge of activity hit a 16-month low for May.The composite PMI – which combines readings for the manufacturing and services sectors – came in at 52.9 from 53 in April.The manufacturing PMI also fell unexpectedly to a three-month low of 51.5 from 51.7 in April.Economists had been expecting an improvement in the manufacturing PMI to 51.9 and for the composite PMI to edge up to 53.2 .The eurozone economy exceeded economists’ expectations in the first quarter but Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said today’s PMI surveys add further weight to suspicions that the growth rate of the first three months “will prove temporary”.He said:The PMI is signalling lacklustre GDP growth of only 0.3% in the second quarter.The forward-looking indicators also suggest that growth is more likely to weaken further than accelerate. Inflows of new work showed the smallest rise for nearly a year-and-a-half, while optimism about the business outlook in the service sector sank to its lowest since July 2015.Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out the eurozone PMI outcome was “odd” given an upbeat survey earlier on Germany. He suspects Spain is likely the “key driver” behind the disappointing eurozone survey. But he added:Overall, the headline data indicate that solid EZ GDP growth in the first quarter will not be repeated in Q2. New business growth in the private sector as a whole rose at its slowest pace since January, and margins contracted. Employment, however increased slightly.Today’s PMI numbers represent a preliminary reading – a final reading will be published next week.
137;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-23T02:08:32Z;Japan manufacturing sector continues to contract;;"As if things couldn’t get any worse for Japanese manufacturers.Nikkei-Markit’s preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index hit a fresh low this month with a reading of 47.6, down from the previous record low of 48.2 in April.The 50-mark separates contraction from expansion, and the sector has now been contracting for three consecutive months.Markit, which helps compile the survey, attributed the poor performance to sluggish global demand and the lingering effects of two severe earthquakes which hit Kyushu in April, disrupting activity in one of Japan’s main manufacturing regions. A strengthening yen won’t have helped matters, either.Earlier on Monday data showed that Japan’s trade surplus rose to its highest level in just over six years in April – a period when the yen traded at its strongest level in eighteen months amid falling imports and exports.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:Manufacturing conditions deteriorated at a faster rate mid-way through the second quarter of 2016, suggesting the aftermath of the earthquakes were still weighing
heavily on goods producers.One of the primary reasons behind the fall in total new orders was a marked contraction in foreign demand, which saw the sharpest fall in over three years. Goods producers were also less optimistic towards their hiring policies with the rate of job
creation easing from April’s three-month record."
138;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-18T10:52:01Z;China and a fast Fed top list of worries;Keeping track of bearish signals in recent market corrections;"Société Générale this week published a list of indicators that it reckons have provided bearish signals in the early phases of recent market corrections.With the caveat that such indicators are not static and can be changed by unknown risks, here are a selection.SocGen has broken down the markets’ main risks into four areas.First, there is concern about a hard landing in China and by extension slowing global growth.The market indicators to watch out for in this regard are: a weakening renminbi, which has become a good indicator of market stress; rising China sovereign credit default swaps, reflecting indebtedness fears; and falling oil and base metal prices, on fretting over waning demand.Next is corporate leverage, which has been increasing in response to ultra-low interest rates.Keep an eye out for signs of stress in the US Markit investment grade and high-yield CDS indices. SocGen also thinks the Bloomberg US dollar Emerging Market Corporate Bond yield should be watched for signs of worrying about faster Fed tightening.Third is equity valuations. “Despite the corrections in equity markets over the summer 2015 and Q1 16, there is still a mismatch between expensive valuations and sluggish global growth,” says SocGen.Keep an eye on price/book ratios and downward earnings revisions.Finally, the market’s worry about European political uncertainty can be gauged by “peripheral” nation CDS and the Markit iTraxx Europe Financial indices.jamie.chisholm@ft.com"
139;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-13T11:35:29Z;Equity outflows accelerate to 5-year high;;Investors whipped $7.4bn out of global equity funds this week, taking the total outflow over the last five weeks to five-year high of $44bn, underscoring deteriorating sentiment towards global equity markets.European equity funds suffered outflows of $3.9bn, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and EPFR. That’s the 14th straight week of redemptions and the longest losing streak for European equity funds since February 2008, writes Joel Lewin.More than $15bn has poured out of European equity ETFs so far this year, compared with inflows of almost $50bn in the same period last year, according to data from Markit. The $8.47bn outflow seen so far this quarter is already a record.Cameron Brandt at EPFR said political risk in the continent, from the UK to Greece, and foreign exchange volatility drove redemptions:The eurozone has lost momentum, hit by the shared currency’s appreciation versus the US dollar, concerns about Greece’s willingness to meet the terms of its current bailout package and the UK’s late June referendum on its EU membership.Emerging market equity funds shed $2.3bn, the largest outflow in 16 weeks, while $2.2bn flowed out of US equity funds.The accelerating equity outflows also highlight mounting concerns over the health of the global economy.Mr Brandt adds:Driving this latest shift are doubts about the effectiveness of the policies pursued by Japan and the eurozone to kick-start economic growth, the erosion of corporate profit margins in the US and China and the structural issues dogging many of the major emerging marketsThe flight from risk has also been underlined by a shift from speculative grade to investment grade bond funds. Investors pulled $1.5bn from high yield bond funds this week, the second week of outflows after a long run of inflows.As the high yield rally has stalled, investors have turned to less risky investment grade funds, which lured $3.2bn this week.
140;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;General Atlantic frontrunner in £950m Argus Media auction;Private equity group eyes controlling stake to value energy reporting group at £950m;General Atlantic has emerged as the frontrunner in an auction to buy a controlling stake in Argus Media, which would value the energy reporting company at around £950m.The London-based company, which helps assess global oil prices and provide industry news, is expected to enter exclusive talks with General Atlantic, a US private equity group, in the next couple of days, people involved in the process said.The sale of a 50 per cent-plus stake would see members of the founding Nasmyth family pocket hundreds of millions of pounds. It would also make dozens of Argus employees — including some of its senior journalists — paper multimillionaires. These include chairman Adrian Binks and Ian Bourne, the editor-in-chief.General Atlantic declined to comment, while Argus could not be reached for comment.Argus is expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around £45m in 2016, the people said, placing a multiple of at least 20 times on the business.In contrast to traditional news organisations, which have struggled amid falling circulation and the shift to digital advertising, groups that focus on providing specialist industry data are thriving.There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies over the past couple of years. These include the planned $13bn merger of data providers Markit and IHS, Verisk Analytics’ agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn in March, and McGraw Hill Financial’s proposal to purchase SNL Financial for $2.2bn in July.Argus was founded in the 1970s by Jan Nasmyth, a former Treasury official and British Army officer, as a weekly newsletter covering the Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp products market. Over the following decades it expanded into other markets. The company’s closest rival is S&P Global Platts.The company appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch earlier this year to conduct a review of its business after receiving approaches from several prospective investors, including trade buyers and private equity funds.Mr Binks, who announced in June that he was stepping down as Argus’ chief executive, is understood to be committed to retaining his stake in the company.

141;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;General Atlantic frontrunner for stake in Argus Media;;General Atlantic has emerged as a frontrunner in an auction to buy a controlling stake in Argus Media, in a deal that could value the energy reporting agency at around £950m, according to people familiar with the matter.The London-based company, which helps assess global oil prices and provide industry news, could enter exclusive talks with General Atlantic, a US private equity group, in the next couple of days, they said.The sale of a 50 per cent plus stake would see members of the founding Nasmyth family pocket hundreds of millions of pounds. It would also make dozens of Argus employees – including some of its senior journalists — paper multi-millionaires. These include chairman Adrian Binks and Ian Bourne, the editor in chief, report Joseph Cotterill, Neil Hume and Arash Massoudi.General Atlantic and Argus Media could not be reached for comment.In contrast to traditional news organisations, which have struggled amid falling circulation and a shift to digital advertising, groups that focus on providing specialist industry data are thriving.There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies over the past couple of years. These include the $13bn merger of data providers Markit and IHS, Verisk Analytics’ agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn in March, and McGraw Hill Financial’s proposal to purchase SNL Financial for $2.2bn in July.Argus is expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around £45m in 2016, the people said, placing a multiple of at least 18 times on the business.
142;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-06T12:58:07Z;‘Anyone wanting a June hike should look away now’;;So says Luke Bartholomew at Aberdeen Asset Management, in light of the latest disappointing headline number from the US payrolls release. The same can probably be said of anyone who just sold dollars against the euro.Mr Bartholomew adds:The headline number is disappointing, while the household survey looks particularly ugly and the recent improvement in the participation rate has gone into reverse. If there’s a bright spot then it’s wages which were a bit better than expected. That’s important. The lack of any meaningful increase in wages has caused much head scratching at the Fed. But there’s probably not enough here to keep a June hike a clear and present danger.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, offered a similar sentiment, noting Fed rate increases may be on hold for some time:April’s data are especially important to policymakers, who are eager to see if the slowdown in the economy in the first quarter will be only temporary. By adding to signs that economic weakness is lingering into the second quarter, these disappointing numbers greatly reduce the likelihood of the Fed hiking rates this side of the Presidential election.Deutsche Bank’s Alan Ruskin is concerned that the slowdown in US business investment may have begun seeping into the labour market:The US payroll report for April was disappointing. The data suggests that US investment in labor has not completely decoupled from the slowdown in investment in plant and machinery, and weak corporate profitability. Weaker data will raise some serious questions about the resilience of the global economy, if the US as ‘locomotive in chief’ is slowing down. The data today is the kind of combination that fits in the terrain that could be dollar negative, as Fed rate hikes are further scaled back. However, there was not much Fed tightening to price out. This has given the dollar downside a degree of protection.The dollar is more than holding its own, which is a strong indication that EM and commodity FX are extremely nervous about global growth momentum. The yen has been and will remain the main beneficiary of these concerns.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, also argued that it “is hard to see why the US Federal Reserve would rush to raise rates” in June. He said:Low interest rates may, in theory, help support the stock market but with lofty valuations already pricing in a strong recovery in the economy and corporate profits this week’s soggy trio of jobs readings could warn of disappointment and further share price volatility ahead.Peter Tchir at Brean Capital noted the big miss on the headline figure and noted the downward revisions, adding:Simply awful report — If June is on table it’s June 2017.

On Tuesday, Commerzbank shares dived more than 11 per cent, UBS shares fell as much as 8 per cent, while Aberdeen Asset Management dropped more than 10 per cent following weak earnings.European banks have fallen 6.7 per cent so far this week, while European miners have dropped more than 12 per cent as fears for China’s economy and a fresh downturn in emerging markets resurfaced.The FTSE 100 has dropped to a four-week low today, 5.5 per cent below its April peak.And outflows have continued from European equity ETFs (exchange traded funds) for the 14th consecutive week, during which they have shed more than $16bn, according to Markit data.Rabobank strategists write:It is still just the beginning of May, but the old market saying “Sell in May and go away” is the best way to describe price action in the first week of the month. A cautious approach prevailed amid renewed concerns about the state of the global economy as revealed in the latest set of data. Market participants also have to assess the odds that the Fed may raise interest rates in June.

Despite the moderation in output, German builders still reported their highest levels of business confidence since March 2006.Construction companies also continued to add jobs in April, but the rate of employment growth weakened to a five month low.The slowdown also indicates the eurozone is set to experience a softer period of growth in the second quarter having defied expectations by expanding by an impressive 0.6 per cent at the start of 2016.But April’s performance evidence Germany’s construction industry was “down but not out” said Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit:It looks likely that the sector will continue to experience favourable conditions in coming months, with constructors the most optimistic about their future prospects since 2006, underpinned by rising new business and sustained job creation.
145;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-06T07:02:33Z;Capital & Counties reassures with London sales;;Capital & Counties, a property company that is the target of short-sellers on concerns over the declining market for high-end London homes, said Friday it has sold another nine units at its Lillie Square development in Earl’s Court.The transactions represent a slower rate of sale than over much of the past two years but may provide some reassurance to investors after its share price dropped by a quarter since the start of 2016, writes Judith Evans, the FT’s Property Correspondent.Investors were spooked by news in February that the developers had sold no new apartments in the scheme since November, playing into fears that demand for luxury apartments had stalled. Some 5.7 per cent of the company’s shares are out on loan to short-sellers, according to data from Markit.Capco said on Friday in a trading update that it had sold 37 of 70 units made available to purchasers in September last year, after earlier selling more than 90 per cent of 237 flats that went on sale in March 2014. The homes are still under construction.It has sold £300m of homes at Lillie Square, with those in the current phase selling for about 5 per cent more than “comparable units” in the first phase, the group said.Capco plans a mixed-use development covering 77 acres in Earl’s Court but also owns swathes of Covent Garden, where it said it had signed 37 new commercial leases and was on track to achieve rental growth targets.

The headline reading fell to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in the previous month.This is the lowest reading since February 2013 and well below the long-term average of the survey. Although any reading above 50 indicates activity is growing, the lower than expected survey suggests there will be only a muted rise in output from the sector which accounts for about 80 per cent of the UK economy.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said that while the EU referendum had had a “profound effect” on the sector, keeping prices stagnant and delaying orders, the sector also has other problems.“Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends,” he said.
147;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-05T08:32:51Z;UK services growth weakest ‘in over 3 years’;;Growth in Britain’s dominant services industry slowed significantly in April, according to a closely-watched indicator of performance, raising fresh concerns that the forthcoming EU membership referendum is putting the brakes on economic expansion.Markit’s services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 52.3 in April from 53.7 the previous month. April’s reading is the lowest since February 2013 and was far worse than forecast – economists had expected a dip to 53.5. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, writes Nathalie Thomas.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the reading “indicates that uncertainty emanating from the E.U. referendum has brought the recovery to its knees.”“The headwinds stemming from the referendum will only intensify over the next two months, he added.The UK economy expanded by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year, down from 0.6 per cent growth in the final quarter of 2015.Recent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors for April have suggested growth has since continued to cool, as businesses and consumers hold back amid concerns over the outcome of the referendum on June 23.Markit’s manufacturing PMI for April fell into contraction territory, registering its worst reading since March 2013, while a similar survey for the construction sector suggested expansion last month had slowed to its weakest rate since June 2013.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the recent PMI surveys suggest GDP growth has slowed further, from 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, to just 0.1 per cent in April. He said:The slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter.The PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April.While he pointed out that some of the slowdown in services growth in April may be down to the earlier timing of Easter this year – it fell at the end of March – he also noted:April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts.The survey also picked up rising input prices, as services companies shouldered a bigger wage bill in April following the introduction of the higher minimum wage – or national living wage – for over 25-year-olds.Mr Williamson highlighted that the April PMI surveys were in territory “which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or through non-standard measures such as QE [quantitative easing]“.The services PMI has now fallen three times in five months. It is the most closely-watched of the PMIs, as services account for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy.
148;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-05T02:53:29Z;Hong Kong PMI shows contraction unabated;;It has been a rough year for Hong Kong’s private sector.The April reading for the Nikkei Hong Kong purchasing managers’ index was 45.3, down from 45.5 in March.The gauge’s 14th month below the 50-point line delineating contraction from expansion saw further falls in output and new orders at Hong Kong businesses, with new orders from mainland China declining for the 21st consecutive month – albeit at a slightly softer rate compared to March.That led to job shedding across the private sector in April, as has been the case in every month for this year. Reduced staffing costs contributed to lower cost burdens, but the rate of deflation remained slight overall.One of the only (relative) bright spots was improvement in delivery times, but even that stemmed from the worsening dearth of orders placed in April.“The weak start to the second quarter indicates that the sector continues to struggle in the face of poor economic conditions and reduced client demand, particularly across mainland China,” said Annabel Fiddes, the Markit economist who compiles the survey. “The latest data therefore add to evidence that more policy action is likely to be required to lift the performance of the economy.”

Ahead of the closely-watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday, the privately prepared ADP payrolls report on Wednesday showed the private sector created a below-expectations 156,000 jobs in April. However a reading on the services sector from the Institute of Supply Management showed the activity expanded at a faster pace last month.The dollar index, a gauge of the US currency against a basket of its global peers, rose a quarter of a percentage point to 93.179, posting back-to-back gains. That saw the yen weaken by 0.4 per cent on Wednesday, although the Japanese currency was sitting 0.1 per cent stronger at Y106.92 today.Here is the economic calendar for today, with the Caixin-Markit survey of the Chinese services sector likely to be one of the most closely-watched releases (Hong Kong times):
150;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-04T10:41:52Z;Downbeat construction survey fuels fears for UK recovery;PMI report records worst month in three years;Britain’s construction industry suffered its worst month in nearly three years in April, in a further sign the economic recovery is losing momentum.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers suggests that while activity is still expanding — just — it is doing so at the slowest pace since June 2013. The headline PMI reading fell to 52.0 in April, down from 54.2 the previous month, but remains above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon, said the survey — the latest in a string to fall to multiyear lows — “adds to evidence that the economic recovery has ground to a near standstill”.With the manufacturing industry also struggling, the UK economy looks like it will again be entirely dependent on the service sector to deliver growth in the second quarter of the year.However, that is also looking softer than before. The Confederation of British Industry reported at the weekend that retail sales had unexpectedly dipped and the GfK consumer confidence indicator has fallen to a 16-month low.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said there were “real and mounting” risks to his forecast of 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter, and if upcoming surveys of the service sector remained weak he would likely cut it further.Sterling slipped again on Wednesday on the weaker than expected economic data and also on the release of a new ICM poll which put the Leave campaign in the lead.Respondents to the construction survey were also gloomier about the outlook for orders, citing increased uncertainty and a “general unwillingness” to commit to new projects.The most recent official data showed the industry contracted by 0.9 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and the downbeat survey suggests the slowdown is likely to persist.Tim Moore, senior economist at survey data provider Markit, said “softer growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted.”Despite the widespread political support for new housebuilding, the sector remains unexpectedly weak, with residential housing activity hovering close to a 38-month low.Commercial building was the strongest performing category, with civil engineering activity also weaker.However, staffing levels continue to increase across the sector, where job growth has been recorded every month since June 2013 — the longest period of sustained increases for around a decade, Markit said.David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said the firms were becoming more cautious and using subcontractors to tide them over until the outlook becomes clearer. “Sunnier times may still be a way off for the construction sector,” he said.
151;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-04T08:51:32Z;Eurozone services growth estimates trimmed;;Estimates of the eurozone service sector’s output in April have been revised down slightly following initial forecasts, with growth remaining “only modest” but still reassuringly widespread.The eurozone service sector purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for April – a well-regarded indicator of performance produced by data group Markit – has been trimmed to 53.1, down from a preliminary reading of 53.2, and in line with March’s number. Anything over 50 denotes expansion.All of the “big four” eurozone countries – France, Germany, Italy and Spain – racked up expansions.However, an estimate of service sector expansion in both France and Germany in April was snipped back slightly from a previous forecast, but nonetheless held comfortably at multi-month highs.France’s purchasing managers’ survey was trimmed back to 50.6 by Markit, down from an initial estimate of 50.8 .Germany’s services PMI fell to 54.5 in April, down from 55.1 in March.Spain clocked a three-month high in the PMI reading of 55.2, while Italy hit a two-month high of 53.1Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the report said:The rate of eurozone economic expansion remained only modest in April. Output rose at a pace slightly below the average seen in the opening quarter of the year, with only moderate growth seen in both the manufacturing and service sectors.He added:Germany’s service sector continued to grow at a steady pace at the start of the second quarter
152;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-03T15:22:21Z;Aberdeen shares suffer worst day since crisis;;Shares in Aberdeen Asset Management have dived 9.7 per cent today, the worst one-day drop since the depths of the financial crisis, after the emerging markets-focused investment group suffered heavy outflows and a deep fall in profits in the six months to March.Even as global equities, and emerging markets more than most, have rebounded since January, outflows from Aberdeen funds have remained heavy, with a net £16.7bn leaving in the six months to March, writes Joel Lewin.A number of analysts have slashed their earnings forecasts for the Scottish asset manager. Tom Mills at Credit Suisse cut his earnings per share forecasts 4 per cent for 2016 and 9 per cent for 2017, predicting net outflows of £30.6bn this year.The heavy outflows from Aberdeen funds over the last six months, particularly emerging market funds, have contrasted starkly with emerging market ETFs, which have attracted substantial inflows.Over the last six months, Aberdeen’s emerging market equity and fixed income funds have suffered outflows of £1.9bn, while equivalent ETFs have lured inflows of $16.7bn in the same period according to Markit data, underscoring the rapidly rising popularity of passive investment funds, which have tended to outperform their active counterparts whilst levying lower fees.Mr Mills said this disparity is one of the reasons “the company remain somewhat cautious”. He writes:Their experience suggests that, so far, investors have been using ETFs to gain market exposure, ahead of allocating to specific managersThere are some signs of hope. The second consecutive quarter of slowing net outflows, the improvement in performance and the recent strengthening of the management team give cause for optimism.Even after today’s heavy drop, Aberdeen shares are up 28 per cent from their February low, and there were a few bright spots in today’s earnings report. Justin Bates at Liberum Capital says:There are some signs of hope. The second consecutive quarter of slowing net outflows, the improvement in performance and the recent strengthening of the management team give cause for optimism.But the optimism was not shared by everyone. S&P Global Market Intelligence Analyst slapped Aberdeen with a ‘sell’ rating. Analyst Caren Ngo Siew Teng writes:Net outflows were still strong at £16.7bn due to weak investor sentiment. The poor results reflected the challenging market conditions, in particular the weakness in emerging markets. We are negative on Aberdeen as we believe net outflows and withdrawals will continue to be strong in the next few quarters
153;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-03T11:47:24Z;UK manufacturing activity contracts for first time in 3 years;Uncertainty over UK referendum on EU membership starts to weigh on economy;Activity in Britain’s struggling manufacturing industry contracted in April for the first time since 2013, as uncertainty generated by the referendum on EU membership weighed on the sector.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers fell to 49.2 in April, the lowest level in more than three years and below the key 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.The combination of the slump in the oil and gas sector, the strength of sterling and a weaker global outlook has been a drag on the industry for some time, with the strength of domestic consumption the only real bright spot.But companies are reporting softer domestic demand as clients delay spending ahead of the referendum.Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said the survey was the “clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy”.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said that an “atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk”.Based on the responses to its survey, Markit estimates that close to 20,000 jobs have been lost in the sector during the past three months.Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, said it was “always on the cards that when growth in domestic demand, which has been supporting recovery, began to falter, the performance of UK manufacturing was going to look more vulnerable”.Sterling fell against the dollar and euro on the weaker than expected data.The poor manufacturing survey data, following a marked slowdown in GDP growth in the first quarter, will fuel concerns about the health of the overall recovery.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was a “worrying and disappointing” survey and Martin Beck, senior economic adviser at EY Item Club, said it offered “further causes for pessimism.”However, as manufacturing only accounts for about 10 per cent of GDP, the overall prospects for the UK remain firmly reliant on the service sector, the only driver of growth in the first quarter of the year.The equivalent PMI for the service sector will be released on Thursday and will be closely watched for signs of a further slowdown in the second quarter of the year.Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, said the concerns cited by respondents to the manufacturing survey of falling retail confidence were an “additional worry” considering the extent to which the UK recovery has been driven by private consumption.Now-casting.com, which uses a statistical model to determine what individual economic data points signal economic growth, is forecasting 0.4 per cent for the second quarter — a more optimistic picture than most.Separately on Tuesday, the European Commission cut its UK growth forecast for the year to 1.8 per cent from the 2.1 per cent it suggested in the winter, saying the risks to the outlook are “tilted to the downside” because of weaker external demand and the uncertainty in the lead-up to the June referendum.
154;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-02T08:01:06Z;French manufacturing downturn deepens;;"Zut alors.A final reading of April’s French manufacturing PMI shows the well-regarded indicator of performance at a one-year low, led by a steep reduction in new orders. In response, manufacturing companies are cutting jobs, according to Markit, which compiles the survey.The purchasing managers’ index slipped to 48 in April from a reading of 49.6 the previous month. The final reading for April, published on Monday, was also worse than an initial estimate of 48.3. Any result below 50 indicates contraction.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the France manufacturing PMI survey, said:The French manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction during April, precipitated by a steeper reduction in new order intakes. This was despite output prices being cut at the steepest rate since mid-2009, highlighting the sector’s struggles in the face of persistently weak demand.
Manufacturers responded with another round of job
shedding and a further cut in purchasing of inputs.One factor to note: despite a series of lacklustre PMI readings, the French economy managed growth of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter.As well as a disappointing result in the French PMI survey, the final reading of April’s Germany manufacturing PMI was revised slightly lower, to 51.8 from an initial estimate of 51.9, although this was still higher than 50.7 in March.However the PMI for the eurozone as a whole for April edged up slightly to 51.7 from 51.6 the previous month, better than the initial estimate of 51.5. The eurozone reading was driven higher by a good result from Italy’s manufacturing sector and an improvement in the headline number for Spain, although as fastFT reported earlier, it wasn’t all good news from Spanish manufacturing companies as growth in new orders fell to a six-month low.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, isn’t getting too carried away with the better than expected eurozone PMI, however. He said:The PMI has now edged higher for two successive months, but has improved only marginally from what was a worryingly low base earlier in the year.The survey is signalling an anaemic annual rate of growth of manufacturing production of just less than 1%, which is half the pace seen in the months leading up to the recent slowdown.Prices also continue to fall, both in terms of raw material costs and average prices charged for goods leaving the factory gate, albeit at reduced rates compared to prior months.The survey data therefore so far show no signs of ECB [European Central Bank] stimulus or the weaker euro helping to revive the manufacturing sector, at least for the euro area as a whole. Hopes are therefore pinned on recent signs of increased bank lending and more aggressive quantitative easing providing the much needed boost."
155;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-02T07:46:18Z;Turkey manufacturing PMI sinks to 7-month low;;There hasn’t been a lot of good news so far this year for the Turkish economy, as tourist numbers have dwindled following a string of terrorist attacks and its manufacturing sector is slowing. Today’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) does little to lift the mood.The PMI – a closely-watched indicator of performance – slipped to a seven-month low in April, to 48.9, falling further below the crucial 50 mark that divides contraction and growth.Although April’s PMI reading remains some way off the low of 48 reached in March last year, Trevor Balchin, senior economist at Markit had little good to say about today’s survey.Commenting on the latest PMI data he said:Turkish manufacturing started Q2 on a weak footing, with the PMI showing steeper falls in both output and new orders amid worsening export demand. The latest PMI data provide a further warning sign that the official growth rate of industrial production – currently updated only to February – will begin to slow in the coming months. More positively, the PMI price indices suggest that inflationary pressures are subsiding.However it should be noted that despite a series of poor PMI readings in 2015 the Turkish economy still expanded by 4 per cent.
156;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-02T07:33:10Z;Spanish manufacturing PMI: ‘Mixed signals’;;The latest survey of activity in Spain’s manufacturing sector is a bit of a mixed bag. While the headline reading of the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is slightly stronger than economists had anticipated, despite the country’s recent political drama, growth in new orders fell to a six-month low in April.The Spain manufacturing PMI – a closely watched gauge of activity produced by data group Markit – came in at 53.5 for April, a slight increase on a reading of 53.4 the previous month and better than the 53 that had been forecast by economists. But it wasn’t all good news, as the survey picked up slower rises in new orders, employment and purchasing activity.Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the PMI report explained:There were mixed signals from the latest Spanish manufacturing PMI, with output growth accelerating but other key variables such as new orders and employment increasing at slower rates. There was also a noticeable weakening in the pace of cost deflation in April in a sign that inflationary pressures may be returning.While there remains little obvious sign that the lack of permanent government in Spain is affecting the sector, a number of respondents mentioned that investment decisions and the securing of new contracts were more difficult given the current uncertainty. This would likely be exacerbated should we have to wait until new elections at the end of June for a government to be formed.Spain has been without a government since its elections late last year, although the stalemate did not appear to affect GDP growth in the first quarter. While unemployment in Spain remains eye-wateringly high, at 20.4 per cent, figures published on Friday delivered the welcome news that the Spanish economy expanded by 0.8 per cent in the first three months of the year, in line with the previous quarter, but better than the 0.7 per cent expansion that had been forecast.

The reading came in just shy of an expected 3.44 per cent.A Markit/Nikkei purchasing managers index also published today showed producer prices rising for the second consecutive month after ending a 19-month stretch of contraction in March.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
159;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-02T03:04:25Z;Taiwan manufacturing falls back into contraction;;Taiwan’s manufacturing industry fell back into contraction in April as output and new orders shrank just a month after the sector had managed to claw its way back into expansionary territory.The latest reading of the Markit/Nikkei purchasing managers index for Taiwanese manufacturing came in at 49.7, falling back below the 50-point mark delineating contraction from expansion after the headline figure had jumped 1.7 percentage points to 51.7 in March.Production saw a mild dip into contraction, while output was also down modestly due to fewer new orders. New work at firms surveyed contracted at the fastest rate in six months, with companies reporting domestic and external demand both remained relatively weak.But despite those setbacks – and in a development similar to that seen in South Korea’s own PMI earlier on Monday – a subindex for employment rose at the fastest rate since 2015. Higher prices for raw materials likewise drove up input prices.Even so, greater competition for work in Taiwan led manufacturers to cut again in April, albeit at the slowest rate in 20 months.Markit economist Annabel Fiddes said:A positive takeaway this month was sustained jobs growth across the sector, with the rate of staff hiring reaching a nine-month high in April. However, unless there is an improvement in client demand and new order books, companies may look to restrict staff numbers in the coming months as downside risks to growth remain.
160;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-05-02T02:05:54Z;S Korea manufacturing decline hits pause in April;;South Korea’s manufacturing industry ended a three-month stretch of contraction in April, but inflationary pressures continued to weigh on the Asian exporter.The Markit/Nikkei purchasing managers index came in at a reading of 50 last month up from 49.5 in March, sitting neatly on the 50-point line dividing expansion from contraction after spending the first three months of 2016 below it.Production declines eased in April, with companies blaming the falls that did occur on weak global demand as new export orders contracted for a third consecutive month. But total new orders held steady thanks to increased domestic demand.That local momentum may have helped boost staff hires, which jumped in April even as inflation rose to a three year peak that the firms surveyed attributed to greater cost burdens from rising raw materials prices, particularly for oil- and metal-related goods.Amy Brownbill, the Markit economist who compiles the South Korea PMI, said:Manufacturing conditions in South Korea stabilised in April, having contracted throughout the first quarter of 2016. Production declined at only a slight rate, while new orders were broadly stable. Meanwhile, firms were more optimistic towards their hiring policies with employment increasing during the month. This shows positive signs for the goods producing sector, and suggests that the official manufacturing production index will remain in positive territory.On a less positive note, inflationary pressures intensified to the greatest extent in over three years, amid reports of higher raw material costs. Moreover, companies were unable to compensate for greater cost burdens, as reports of increased competition and price negotiations from clients led firms to reduce their own charges further.”
161;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-29T13:52:25Z;European ETFs hit by record outflows;;ETFs tracking European assets have suffered a rush to the exits, with particularly heavy redemptions from equities as the rally that pushed the region’s stocks to multi-month highs runs out of steam.Some $2.63bn poured out of ETFs tracking European assets in the first four days of this week, according to Markit data, which is already a record outflow. Most of these redemptions- $2.41bn- came from equity funds, writes Joel Lewin.Of course, outright redemption figures are bound to grow in a growing overall market. Still, including active funds, redemptions from European equity funds hit $4.8bn this week, the largest in 80 weeks. Year-to-date outflows have topped $24bn, according to data from EPFR and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.This comes even as the European Central Bank launches its souped up easing package, including cutting rates even deeper into negative territory and jacking up its monthly bond purchases by €20bn. ECB watchers have raised concerns that after the first round of negative rates and QE failed to ignite inflation and spark a sustained equity rally, more of the same won’t work either.Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR said:Investors are skeptical monetary stimulus alone will kick the Eurozone economy into high gear and remain worried that some of the measures, such as negative interest rates, will cause more problems than they solve.In the first half of last year, when the ECB launched its first round of easing, European equity ETFs lured in almost $50bn. So far this year, they have shed more than $13bn.European credit funds, on the other hand, have proved popular, drawing in $1bn this week, the seventh straight week of gains, according to BAML and EPFR data.BAML strategists write:The ECB corporate QE has been the catalyst for a U-turn on credit flows. The sudden course of action the ECB ignited for credit might have also caused another consequence for flows: with inflation expectations still anchored, equities have seen more outflows.UK equity ETFs have suffered outflows of $175m so far this week, according to Markit data, their largest in at least six months.But the outflows could intensify yet.BAML strategists predict a “summer of shocks” as the most plausible outcome for global markets given the plethora of risks lurking, including a potential June Fed rate hike, the yen’s surge, China’s slowing economy and volatile markets, as well as the UK’s EU referendum.
162;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-28T17:21:28Z;EU regulators closer to ending five-year CDS investigation;European Commission says it has won concessions from Markit and Isda in CDS investigation;European antitrust regulators have indicated they are moving closer to ending a five-year long investigation into alleged collusion in the credit derivatives markets by settling for more independent decision-making from the organisations that licence the industry’s main data and indices.The European Commission said on Thursday it had received potential concessions from Markit, the UK data provider, and Isda, the derivatives trade association at the heart of the long-running probe.Brussels said the two had proposed to licence their intellectual property used to help price credit default swaps to exchanges wanting to trade, and clear them “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”. It has opened a month-long period for the market to comment on the proposals.An acceptance would mark a comedown by Brussels, which had initially charged 13 banks, Isda and Markit for allegedly conspiring to block exchanges from developing the trading of credit default swaps on exchanges.The near-400 page charge sheet alleged collusion to ensure the insurance-like contracts remained an “over-the-counter” (OTC) product – preserving the banks’ lucrative role as middlemen.Credit default swaps provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to manage risk and bet on creditworthiness.However the case built by Brussels suffered a major blow last December after it cleared 13 of the world’s largest investment banks - including Citigroup, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan - citing “a lack of evidence”. If guilty, they could have faced fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover.Both Isda and Markit agreed to prevent investment banks - which dominate Isda’s membership and sit on Markit advisory committees - from influencing their decisions on licensing. Both sets of commitments would apply for ten years and be monitored by an independent trustee, the regulator said.Markit, which owns credit data indices, said it believed it had acted appropriately at all times and the proposals “would resolve the investigation without any finding of wrongdoing or monetary liability.”Isda, which runs the process to determine if there has been a corporate default that would trigger a payout, said it was “confident that the proceedings will ultimately be terminated” and was “committed to ensuring the CDS market functions safely and efficiently.”Investigators claimed that from 2006 to 2009 the banks protected their dominant position in what was then a $25tn global market. However, the CDS market has fallen out of favour with investors since the financial crisis while attempts to push credit derivatives onto exchanges have foundered due to lack of interest.
163;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-28T10:54:30Z;EU ready to drop probe into CDS collusion;;European antitrust regulators are looking to end a five-year investigation into possible collusion in the credit default swaps market after receiving potential concessions with Markit, the UK data provider, and Isda, the derivatives trade association.The European Commission said on Thursday that both Markit and Isda had proposed to licence their derivatives trading intellectual property for exchange-based trading and clearing “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”, writes Philip Stafford, FT Trading Room editor.Both also agreed to prevent investment banks – which dominate Isda’s membership and sit on Markit advisory committees – from influencing their decisions on licensing.The commitments would apply for ten years and be monitored by an independent trustee, the regulator said. It is inviting comment from interested parties on the proposals.According to the commission’s preliminary concerns in 2013, Isda and Markit refused to license to exchange trading platforms certain data and indices used by the industry for the pricing of CDS.This may have blocked or delayed the emergence of an effective market for exchange traded credit derivatives, the regulator said.However, the case built by Brussels suffered a major blow last December after it cleared 13 of the world’s largest investment banks, citing “a lack of evidence”.The commission had tried to show that the investment banks — including Citigroup, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan — had colluded with Isda and Markit to shut out exchanges.
164;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-27T13:21:30Z;ICE’s Trayport deal faces in-depth competition probe;;Intercontinental Exchange’s $650m purchase of Trayport, an electronic energy trading platform, last autumn faces in in-depth antitrust investigation by UK authorities.The acquisition from interdealer broker BGC Partners gave ICE a dominant position in the hybrid energy trading markets in Europe, in which markets such as oil and coal remain brokered over the phone although they are traded in blocks of futures, writes Philip Stafford.Trayport is a London-based software platform that allows traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct both voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions markets. It is widely recognised as the pre-eminent platform by which those markets price and execute trades.The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday:The CMA is concerned that ICE could use its ownership of Trayport’s software to raise prices and/or reduce the quality of its service to rival exchanges, brokers and clearing houses in order to divert its rivals’ trades to ICE’s exchange and clearinghouse and/or to protect its market position from increased competition.The deal will be referred for an in-depth investigation by an independent group of CMA panel members unless ICE is able to offer undertakings which address the CMA’s concerns.ICE beat US rival CME and UK data provider Markit to the purchase last November. ICE already owns extensive energy assets in Europe, including the venue that was once the International Petroleum Exchange.
165;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-27T09:45:50Z;UK growth slowdown: economists react;;An expected slowdown in UK growth was confirmed this morning, after the economy expanded by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent at the end of 2015. Here, fastFT rounds up reactions to the figures.The first quarter GDP growth figure is in line with analyst expectations, but is the worst opening quarter in three years. On an annualised measure, the UK economy expanded 2.1 per cent during the period.Economists across the board cite the looming EU referendum as one of the drivers.But Samuel Tombs at Pantheon notes the UK’s ills should not all be pinned on the referendum:The fiscal squeeze has tightened this year after a pre-election pause, while the boost to growth in household spending from falling saving and rapid employment growth has run its course.Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate remains uncompetitive and its recent fall likely won’t be sustained if the UK remains in the EU.A weak economic outlook over the rest of the year could also prompt the Bank of England into cutting interest rates, says Chris Williamson at Markit:The outlook beyond the second quarter has inevitably become increasingly cloudy with the uncertain outcome of the referendum, meaning all forecasts of economic growth carry huge health warnings.Similarly, any decisions on policy at the Bank of England are likely to be kicked into the long grass until after the referendum, but these disappointing numbers will no doubt add to speculation that the next move in interest rates will be a cut.But Ruth Miller at Capital Economics expects economic activity could quickly rebound after the summer vote:Many of the factors likely to be to blame for Q1’s weakness should prove short-lived. Uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum in June appears to be taking some toll on economic activity, but it probably does not account for all of the softnessOf course, there is still a risk that Brexit jitters will further sap the recovery of its momentum in Q2. But even if growth did continue to slow, if the UK voted to stay in the EU, we would probably just see a bounce-back in Q3.There are also worrying signs that economic rebalancing is yet to take hold, despite a weaker sterling, said Rain Newton-Smith at the CBI.Weak manufacturing output highlights the pressures the sector continues to face despite some relief from the depreciation in sterling. Construction has also had a surprisingly weak first quarter, although the data are highly prone to revision.Flash estimates from the Office for National Statistics are also highly prone to revision, notes Kallum Pickering at Berenberg, who expects today’s numbers to get a healthy downgrade from the statisticians:With today’s data, we suggest particular caution.Remember, this year was the worst start in financial markets since 2008. Underpinning the rout were concerns about a global recession that reached a crest in February.PMI data across all three major sectors, while still suggesting expansion, pointed to multi-year lows before ticking up in March. As such, February data will probably be the worst performing month in Q1 and might have caused the typically conservative ONS to lowball the March estimates.
166;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-27T08:33:59Z;UK GDP growth slows ahead of Brexit vote;;Britain’s economy has slowed down ahead of the EU referendum in June, growing by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year, from a previous quarterly pace of 0.6 per cent.The GDP figures came in line with analyst expectations, according to a first estimate from the Office for National Statistics.The year-on-year growth hit 2.1 per cent, in line with the previous quarter’s reading, but is the weakest first quarter reading for three years.Britain’s dominant services continued to power the bulk of the expansion, growing by 0.5 per cent in the three months to March. By contrast, all three industrial sectors – production, construction and agriculture – contracted or fell flat at the start of 2016.ONS Chief Economist Joe Grice said:Today’s figures suggest growth has slowed as compared with the pace up to the middle of last year. Services continue to underpin the economy but other sectors have shown falling output this quarter.Economists have warned of a slowdown in economic activity as Britain prepares to vote on its EU future in a referendum on June 23.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has been the latest to weigh into the debate this morning, calculating an EU exit would cost Britons the equivalent of a whole month’s salary by 2020.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said more recent monthly economic data suggests the economic slowdown has “gathered pace significantly… suggesting that the economy started the second quarter on the back foot”.Williamson adds:Uncertainty about the economic outlook appears to have intensified ahead of the EU referendum, and the danger is that this will cause a lull in businesses decision making as the June vote draws closer, which will in turn reduce business spending, investment and hiring in the second quarter.
167;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-22T08:30:41Z;Eurozone manufacturing and services stuttering;;"The eurozone’s manufacturing and service sectors kept expanding moderately in April, but failed to pick up momentum, suggesting the region “remains stuck in a slow growth rut”.Markit’s preliminary estimates for its purchasing managers indices showed a miniscule improvement in services expansion, and a small drop in manufacturing.The manufacturing PMI fell to 51.5 in April, slightly below 51.6 in March, but well short of economist forecasts of a 51.9 reading. Readings over 50 indicate expansion.The services sector index came in at 53.2, very slightly ahead of 53.1 in March, but also undershooting economists’ forecasts of 53.3.Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said:A failure of business expectations to revive following the ECB’s announcement of more aggressive stimulus in March is a major disappointment and suggests that the modest pace of growth is unlikely to accelerate in coming monthsThe eurozone economy remains stuck in a slow growth rut in April, with the PMI once again signalling GDP growth of just 0.3% at the start of the second quarter, broadly in line with the meagre pace of expansion seen now for a full year.Even more aggressive policy action may therefore be required to drive a more robust and sustainable recovery and reignite inflationary pressures.Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics also raised concerns over deflationary pressures. He writes:Selling prices continue to fall in the Eurozone as a whole, which suggests that firms still face competitive pressures which force them cut prices to maintain market share.He said the PMIs show:growth remains below its long-run average… but also that the survey remains far off levels normally associated with economic downturns. In other words; the cyclical recovery, while sluggish, likely will continue.Chart courtesy of Pantheon Macroeconomics"
168;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-22T07:13:17Z;Services doing heavy lifting for France;;The initial estimate of France’s purchasing managers’ indices, broad measures of health in the business sector, show that services are picking up a lot of the slack from manufacturing.Markit, which compiles the data, said the index covering services rose to 50.8 in April, from the slightly sub-50 mark indicating contraction in March. The reading beat forecasts among economists for a rise to 50.1. The manufacturing index, however, dropped unexpectedly to 48.3, an eight-month low.Markit’s Jack Kennedy said:Expansion was centred on the dominant service sector, as manufacturing was weighed down by a sharp drop in incoming new orders. While service providers reported a pick-up in new business growth, their future expectations slipped back. The PMI data continue to paint a picture of a private sector economy stuck in a weak growth trajectory accompanied by little meaningful job creation.The bright reading for services meant that the composite index rose faster than expected to 50.5 from 50.Here is the release from Markit.
169;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-22T02:19:42Z;Japanese manufacturing shrinks by most since 2013;;Japan’s manufacturing sector is having a terrible month, with recent earthquakes compounding already-sluggish growth according to a closely watched PMI series.Nikkei-Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 48 this month, down from 49.1 in March and setting a new record low for the series. This is the worst result since January 2013, according to Markit.Two major earthquakes struck the southern island of Kyushu earlier this month, disrupting activity across one of Japan’s manufacturing heartlands. Exporters are also grappling with a resurgent yen.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:Manufacturing conditions in Japan worsened at a sharper rate in April. Both production and new orders declined markedly, with total new work contracting at the fastest rate in over three years.The sharp drop in total new work was underpinned by the fastest fall in international demand since December 2012, and following the two earthquakes on the island of Kyushu (one of Japan’s key manufacturing regions), the outlook of the goods-producing sector now looks especially uncertain.

Generali’s five-year credit default swaps – which protect investors against the risk of default – fell sharply, implying a boost in the value of its bonds.A bond sold by German insurer Allianz, which matures in 2031, rose to trade at 100.6 cents, from below 99 cents before the meeting.Insurance bonds have been hit hard this year, with fears over negative interest rates sparking concerns over the business model.In early March, they were the worst performing of any major corporate bond sector so far in 2016, according to a Markit data.
171;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-08T15:11:04Z;US inflation bond funds lure record inflows;;New York Fed head Bill Dudley said today that weak inflation remains a “cause for concern”. However, many investors are concerned about quite the opposite, as record inflows into US inflation-linked bond ETFs highlight.In the first quarter, a record $2.31bn flowed into ETFs tracking Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), according to Markit data. After just four days this week, investors have pumped an unprecedented $628m into these funds, writes Joel Lewin.Inflation-linked bonds provide investors protection against inflation, and guarantee a return higher than inflation if held to maturity.As commodity prices have jumped and oil prices have rebounded strongly, rising more than 50 per cent from their February low, US inflation expectations have surged.Inflation expectations have also been helped along by a sharp decline in the dollar, fuelled by a dovish turn from the Fed which has pushed down expectations of the future path of interest rates.Chart courtesy of BloombergThe US 5-year breakeven inflation rate (the difference in yield between nominal and inflation adjusted long-term Treasuries) has jumped from a 7-year low of 1.43 per cent in February to 1.70 per cent today.But while US investors and some Fed officials fret over the risks presented by resurgent inflation expectations, central bankers in the eurozone are facing very different concerns. In February, eurozone inflation expectations hit a record low, and have hovered there since, failing to advance even as oil prices rebound.Chart courtesy of Markit
172;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-05T13:18:29Z;IHS, Markit do not expect inversion curbs to halt deal;;IHS and Markit have said they do not expect their $13bn stock deal to be affected by planned new US rules designed to rein in transactions that allow American companies to switch their tax residence.Denver-based IHS agreed to combine with London’s Markit last month to create a data powerhouse to challenge Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. The new company would be headquartered in London, writes Philip Stafford.“We expect that the new rules would not result in the IHS Markit merger-of-equals transaction being subject to US Code 7874,” the two companies said in a statement on Tuesday.“Based on our preliminary review at this time, we also believe that the other US Treasury rule changes will not impact the combined company’s adjusted effective tax rate guidance of a low to mid-twenties percentage range.”
173;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-05T08:35:19Z;UK services suffer weakest quarter of growth since 2013 – Markit;;Growth in the UK economy is expected to cool to around 0.4 per cent in the first quarter after a closely-watched survey of activity in Britain’s dominant services sector indicated the industry suffered its weakest quarter of output growth for three years.The UK services purchasing managers’ index, produced by research group Markit, came in at 53.7 for March, after staging a surprise drop to 52.7 in February. Economists had been expecting an improvement in the March reading to 53.5.But despite the better than expected outcome last month, Markit said the performance over the first quarter as a whole indicated the weakest quarter of output growth in services since the first quarter of 2013.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the survey, said:An upturn in the pace of service sector growth in March was insufficient to prevent the PMI surveys from collectively indicating a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year.Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, which helps to produce the services PMI, cited the Brexit referendum as a possible factor at play. He said of the March services PMI:The sector appeared to have pressed ‘pause’ on significant progress during March, with the level of new business rising at its slowest pace since January 2013. Though the index was still in positive territory, the impact of increased competition, uncertainty over Brexit and new buy-to-let and stamp duty rules possibly cooling the housing market showed that there was less appetite for a more robust response in activity.Services, covering everything from hotels and retailers to banks, account for nearly 80 per cent of the UK economy. But recent PMI surveys for other sectors such as manufacturing and construction have also painted a picture of slowing growth in the first quarter.The UK manufacturing sector’s performance over the first quarter as a whole was one of the most feeble in the last three years, according to the PMI surveys for that industry. The pace of growth in the construction sector continued to languish at a 10-month low in March, the construction PMI, published yesterday, indicated.
174;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-05T08:17:23Z;Eurozone services sector disappoints heavily;;It has been a disappointing morning for the eurozone’s services sector, which expanded at the slowest pace in 15-months in March following some sharp downwards revisions to Markit’s surveys of managers.The eurozone purchasing managers index, compiled by Markit, was revised down to 53.1 from an earlier reading of 54. That’s the lowest reading since January 2015. (Readings above 50 indicate expansion.)The drop was driven by negative revisions in Italy, France and Germany, all of which saw their service sectors turn in surprisingly underwhelming performances in March.“Ominous”, said Pantheon Macroeconomics’ Claus Vistesen of the trading bloc’s services sector. “Weakness in services amid persistently sluggish manufacturing is a worry,” he added.The French service sector was the bottom of the bunch, contracting for the second consecutive month after the PMI was revised down to 49.9 from an earlier reading of 51.2. This is the first time it has contacted for two months in a row since 2014.Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, said of the French reading:There remains little sign of the stagnancy lifting – although business expectations rose to the highest since last August they remain subdued in historical terms. Competitive pressures saw another round of output price cutting as firms competed for new business, underlining the challenging environment.The German services PMI was revised down to 55.1 from an earlier reading of 55.5, which dragged the composite PMI down to 54 from 54.1. The growth in new work slowed to the weakest in five months, while the rate of job growth declined to the slowest since July.Italy’s services PMI suffered a particularly chunky downwards revision, falling to 51.2 from an earlier estimate of 53.9.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said:The eurozone economy failed to show any significant gain in momentum in March.Sluggish growth is the result of lacklustre demand, accompanied by falling prices as firms compete at the expense of profit margins. Not surprisingly, hiring is coming under increased pressure as firms struggle to contain costs.Hopes are pinned on the economy being rejuvenated by the ECB’s more assertive policy initiatives, and the upturn in service sector optimism seen during the month suggests that firms are taking a more positive view of the outlook
175;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-05T07:50:38Z;Italian services record slowest growth rate for 13 months – Markit;;"Ouch.Activity in Italy’s services sector, covering everything from banks to retailers and hotels, rose at the slowest rate for 13 months in March, according to a closely-watched survey, adding to concerns that the country’s recovery is grinding to a halt.The Italian services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in March from 53.8 the previous month, dramatically undershooting economists’ expectations for an improvement to 53.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. The March reading was the lowest since February last year.Last year was a tale of two halves for the Italian economy; it triumphantly returned to growth following a triple dip recession but concerns began to mount at the end of the year that the recovery was already grinding to a halt. The economy only managed to eke out growth of 0.1 per cent in the final four months of 2015.Phil Smith, economist at Markit and author of the Italy Services PMI said:The drop in the services PMI signals a loss of growth momentum at the end of the first quarter.Furthermore, beyond the disappointing headline reading there were other warning signals from latest PMI data. The amount of work-in-hand at businesses showed the greatest monthly fall for over a year, while employment growth slowed to near-stagnation as companies’ expectations towards future performance weakened.There was also evidence of service providers lowering charges to support demand amid a highly competitive environment. This trend was also shown by the latest manufacturing PMI data, to signal broad-based deflationary forces.The PMI survey for Italy’s manufacturing sector, published last week, showed the country’s factories ended the first quarter on a better note after the index fell to a 12-month low in February. But the manufacturing PMI performance for the first quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2015."

Apart from last year’s pre-election blip, this is the weakest since the summer of 2013 although it still indicates activity is increasing.Companies report that while the underlying economic fundamentals are supportive, uncertainty about the business outlook is leading to more cautious spending from clients.“Clients were unwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work,” Mr Noble said.The survey is the latest indicator that uncertainty around the outcome of the referendum is starting to feed through to the real economy as companies adopt a wait-and-see attitude.A separate Deloitte survey of chief financial officers on Monday showed respondents expect caution and cost-cutting to dominate.Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said the similar readings across multiple surveys “suggest that Q2 could see a marked slowdown in the economy, as businesses put longer term decisions on hold ahead of the EU referendum”.Sterling fell to a more than two-year low on a trade-weighted basis on Monday. The cost of buying protection against a plunge in the value of sterling after the EU referendum has also soared as the polls have narrowed.The drop in the housebuilding section of the PMI will be a particular concern to politicians. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon, said this suggested the sector’s problems “run deeper than business concerns about Brexit”.“It seems that the stimulus to housebuilding from strong gains in house prices is being offset by sharp increases in labour costs due to skilled worker shortages.”There was a slightly brighter picture in civil engineering and commercial work that both increased slightly. The industry is also being helped by the fall in commodity prices as companies enjoy the lowest rate of cost increases for more than six years.
177;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK construction activity remains at 10-month low – Markit;;The pace of growth in the UK construction industry remained at a 10-month low in March, adding to a picture of weakness in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the closing months of last year.The purchasing managers’ index for the construction sector, a survey produced by data group Markit, was unchanged at 54.2 in March – a 10-month low. Economists had been expecting a further fall in the reading to 54.1.Although there was a rebound in commercial and civil engineering work last month, Markit said this was offset by the residential housing sector, which recorded the weakest pace of growth since January 2013 despite efforts by the government to encourage more housebuilding.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said:Residential building has seen the greatest loss of momentum through the first quarter of 2016, which is a surprising reversal of fortunes given strong market fundamentals and its clear outperformance over the past three years.Construction firms were reliant on a rebound in commercial building and resurgent civil engineering growth to offset the slowdown in housing activity. Civil engineering delivered its strongest performance for just over a year, suggesting that a healthy pipeline of infrastructure projects continues to boost construction output.However, heightened uncertainty about the business outlook appears to have weighed on overall construction demand so far in 2016, with survey respondents citing cautious client spending patterns and a reduced willingness to commit to new projects.UK GDP growth for the fourth quarter was last week revised up to 0.6 per cent from a previous estimate of 0.5 per cent but more recent survey data has pointed to a drop in the pace of expansion in the first three months of 2016.The latest PMI data for the manufacturing industry, published last week, suggested the sector was stalling amid disappointing demand for British exports. Services now account for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy.
178;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T12:34:31Z;"US adds 215k jobs; Jobless rate rises";;The pace of US job growth remained robust, while wages climbed more than forecast in March. However a rise in the jobless rate added credence to the Federal Reserve’s caution on the economy.The labour market has been a bright spot in the world’s most important economy, producing consistent payroll gains despite slow growth for many US trading partners and a sharp cut-back in investment and jobs in the energy sector caused by the a sustained period of low oil prices.Indeed, the economy added 215,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said, from 245,000 the month prior. That compares to economists’ expectations of 205,000.Meanwhile, the jobless rate ticked up by 0.1 percentage point to 5 per cent, compared with expectations that it would hold steady. Part of the reason for the rise was people entering the labour market, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Indeed, the labour force participation rate climbed to 63 per cent from 62.9 per cent the month priorThe jobless rate is also just above the rate that many economists consider to be the structural level in a well-functioning economy. It also represents a stunning improvement from the crisis-era peak of 10 per cent in October 2009.Even as slack in the labour market has tightened, several measures have remained subdued, causing concern among Federal Reserve policymakers.Indeed, Fed head Janet Yellen said earlier this week that “there is a little more slack in the labour market than one would surmise by looking at the unemployment rate alone”.Perhaps the most closely-watched statistic has been wage growth, which has remained fairly tepid despite the fall in the jobless rate – which in theory should put upward pressure on wages. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 per cent in March from the month prior, while the year-on-year rate climbed to 2.3 per cent from 2.2 per cent in February.The sluggish pace is of particular concern to policymakers since slow growth and low energy prices have weighed heavily on inflation abroad. While the Fed does not want inflation to pick up too much, excessively low inflation could weigh on economic growth by cooling consumer spending.Ms Yellen also warned this week of the potential for the weak global environment to begin weighing on the US labour market, even if that has not yet been indicated in the data.“…if foreign developments were to adversely affect the US economy by more than I expect, then the pace of labour market improvement would probably be slower, which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices,” she said in a speech in New York this week.That has caused the Fed to take a cautious tone on its rate rise plans, forecasting in March just two quarter-point rate increases this year, from a December estimate of four. Fed fund futures handicap just one raise this year, according to Bloomberg calculations on CME group data.
179;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T11:46:59Z;UK manufacturing hit by weak export orders;Factories struggle with commodity slump and strength of sterling;Activity in Britain’s manufacturing industry has stalled, with companies cutting jobs as export orders continue to disappoint.Factories across the UK are struggling against the headwinds of weaker global growth, the commodity price slump hitting investment in the oil and gas sector and the historic strength of sterling.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers recorded another month of near stagnation, with the index broadly flat at 51.0 in March, close to February’s 34-month low of 50.8, with 50 being the neutral point that indicates flat activity.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said that the sector “remained in the doldrums” and will struggle to make any contribution to overall growth.Some analysts believe the sector will pick up in the second half of the year as the sharp decline in the value of sterling starts to feed through to bottom lines and make exports more competitive.Sterling fell to a new 16-month low against the euro on the weaker than expected survey data.It is unclear to what extent uncertainty about the prospects of a British exit from the EU is impacting on investment decisions and orders.The domestic market remains the main source of new contract wins for manufacturers, the PMI survey suggests, reinforcing the extent to which consumer consumption is driving the economic recovery.By contrast, new export business declined for the third straight month. While there were reports that small businesses were still hiring, jobs were lost at larger businesses.On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics reported that business investment had fallen in the final quarter of 2015 and that it was private consumption that drove the upward revisions to gross domestic product growth.Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC, said in a note to clients that “the old imbalances remain very much in place”.Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers’ association, said that while there are still “ pockets of growth” in the sector — notably in areas such as chemicals and electronics — the overall picture was subdued.“There isn’t anything in this, or other surveys of late to suggest that manufacturing will make much of a dent in the imbalanced growth across the UK economy in the coming quarters,” she added.
180;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T08:36:55Z;UK manufacturing sector ‘in the doldrums’ – Markit;;This is unlikely to alleviate fears that uncertainty caused by the Brexit referendum is harming economic activity.Growth in the UK’s manufacturing sector was weaker than expected in March while the sector’s performance over the first quarter as a whole was one of the most feeble in the last three years, according to the closely-watched purchasing’ managers index.The UK manufacturing PMI for March came in at 51. Although this was an improvement from 50.8 the previous month – a 34-month low – economists had been expecting a slightly stronger reading of 51.2. The PMI had dropped substantially in February from 52.9 in January.This meant that over the first quarter as a whole the PMI averaged out at 51.6, equalling the lowest record since early 2013.Figures released yesterday showed the UK economy expanded at a stronger pace than expected in the final three months of 2015 but recent survey data has raised fears that growth may cool substantially in the first quarter of this year as consumers and businesses rein in spending amid uncertainty around the outcome of the forthcoming Brexit referendum. The PMI for the UK’s dominant services industry in February, for example, showed the weakest pace of growth since March 2013.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys said:The UK manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums during the opening quarter of the year. Although March saw modest improvements in the trends for production and new orders, industry is still hovering close to the stagnation mark and will struggle to make a meaningful contribution to the next set of GDP growth figures.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply added:Though the overall index showed a rise [for March], the marginal increase will fuel concerns around strong supply chain continuity and any further impacts from major economic challenges such as the results of the Brexit vote.Fourth quarter GDP growth was yesterday revised up to 0.6 per cent from a previous estimate of 0.5 per cent and the numbers contained some better news for the UK’s manufacturers. It had previously been estimated that the manufacturing sector flat-lined in the fourth quarter but the ONS yesterday said it in fact grew 0.1 per cent.However, Britain’s services sector still did all of the heavy lifting in the final quarter of last year. The services sector, covering everything from hotels and restaurants to accountancy firms, now accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the UK economy.While the fourth quarter GDP figures were better than expected, other figures released yesterday showed Britain’s current account deficit ballooned to £32.7bn in the fourth quarter, the biggest deficit as a share of GDP since records began in 1955, equating to some 7 per cent of GDP.
181;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T08:18:53Z;Eurozone manufacturing improves, but gloom persists;;There’s a dash of good news for Europe’s manufacturing sector, as a closely-watched survey tracking sentiment improved for the first time this year, edging up from the year low it hit in February.The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) compiled by data group Markit rose to 51.6, up from an initial reading of 51.4 and February’s reading of 51.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.However, that is still only a whisker above the year-low it hit last month, and behind the headline figure there are some alarming details.Output prices fell at the fastest pace in more than seven years, while the decline in selling prices was the steepest in more than six years, underscoring the challenges the region faces in stoking inflation. France and Germany suffered particularly intense deflationary pressures, and every country except Austria saw selling prices drop.Manufacturing employment increased for the nineteenth consecutive month, but the increase in March was the weakest seen during that period.Germany’s manufacturing PMI improved for the first time this year. The reading was revised up to 50.7 from an initial reading of 50.4, and last month’s reading of 50.5Italy and Spain’s PMIs rose to three-month highs of 53.5 and 53.4 respectively.However, France slipped back into contraction for the first time in seven months, slipping to a reading of 49.6.“Eurozone manufacturers are clearly still finding life difficult,” said Howard Archer at IHS, and added:The Eurozone manufacturing sector is clearly suffering as export orders are limited by muted global growth. On top of this it appears that recent weaker Eurozone business and consumer confidence is limiting demand for capital goods and for consumer durable goods.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said:Policymakers will also be worried by the further intensification of deflationary pressures in manufacturing supply chains, with prices charged at the factory gate falling at the steepest rate since late-2009. Discounting was widespread as firms competed on price amid weak demandFirst chart courtesy of Bloomberg software, second and third charts courtesy of Markit
182;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T07:50:40Z;Italian manufacturers end Q1 on better footing;;Italy’s manufacturing sector ended the first quarter on a better note, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index.The PMI index, a well-regarded survey of activity, came in at 53.5 for March after falling to a 12-month low of 52.2 in February. Economists had been anticipating a smaller rise to 52.5.The Italian economy finally returned to growth in 2015 following a painful triple dip recession but came close to stagnating in the final quarter, eking out GDP growth of just 0.1 per cent, sparking fears that its recovery was grinding to a halt.The latest PMI readings have only served to support these concerns. After hitting a high of 55.6 in December, the manufacturing PMI shrank to 53.2 in January and fell further to 52.2 in February. Although it still remains safely above the 50 reading that divides contraction and growth, the PMI performance for the first quarter as a whole is the weakest since the same three months in 2015.Phil Smith, economist at Markit which compiles the Italy Manufacturing PMI, said:The manufacturing sector ended the first quarter on a solid footing, according to the latest PMI data, with March seeing accelerated growth in output and inflows of new orders. Moreover, with inventories of finished goods falling sharply, there’s a good chance that production will be ramped up further to replenish stock.However, demand was partly boosted by the lowering of output charges, which showed the largest monthly fall in over a year in March, as falling input prices provided manufacturers with yet more scope to slash tariffs.
183;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T07:23:07Z;Growth in Spain’s manufacturing sector slows – Markit;;Spain’s manufacturing sector had a disappointing March, according to a closely watched survey of activity.The Spanish purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 53.4 in March from a reading of 54.1 in February. Economists had expected a slight dip, but only to 54. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.Spain’s manufacturing sector had a decent start to 2016, clocking up a reading of 55.4 in January despite political uncertainty following its general election in December, which failed to hand a clear majority to either the political left or the right.Spain’s economy expanded by 3.2 per cent last year but the country is still dogged by a large public deficit, which was ballooned beyond forecasts last year. Figures yesterday showed Spain racked up a far worse than expected deficit of €56.6bn in 2015, equivalent to 5.2 per cent of GDP and a full percentage point above the target set by Brussels.As the FT’s Tobias Buck has been reporting, Spain has been without a proper government since its elections. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is continuing to serve as the country’s de facto leader but does not have the constitutional or parliamentary power to introduce new budgetary measures.However Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, which produces the PMI surveys, said it was not all bad news despite the disappointing outcome for March:Although growth in the Spanish manufacturing sector has slowed from the start of the year, the latest monthly improvements in output and new orders were still respectable and there is little sign at this stage of a move towards stagnation. In fact, some firms highlighted positive expectations as a factor supporting job creation in March, re-enforcing a positive near-term outlook for the sector.
184;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
185;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T02:48:24Z;Taiwan PMI points to mixed recovery;;Taiwan’s manufacturing sector returned to growth in March, popping up 1.7 percentage points to a reading of 51.7 after falling to 49.4 in February.The latest reading of the Nikkei Taiwan manufacturing PMI comes after several months of flirting above and under the 50-point mark which delineates growth from contraction.Taiwan’s manufacturing sector spent eight straight months in contractionary territory in 2015, only to pop up to a peak of 51.7 in December.Input costs for manufacturers rose for the first time in 18 months, albeit modestly, as did new orders and output. But prices continued to fall as firms sought to line up more work, and export orders fell as well, contrasting with an uptick in the latter in China as reported in PMI readings also released today.“Higher production contributed to a moderate expansion of purchasing activity. However, as client demand was relatively subdued, firms maintained cautious inventory policies, with stocks of both finished and production inputs falling again in March,” said Nikkei.Annabel Fiddes, economist at Markit, added:Soft demand conditions were also highlighted by the fact that companies continued to discount their selling prices in order to secure new work.Unless global economic conditions start to improve and demand picks up, it is uncertain whether Taiwan’s manufacturing sector can sustain the current upturn in growth momentum into the second quarter.
186;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-04-01T01:43:47Z;South Korean manufacturing decline slowed in March;;South Korea’s manufacturing sector contracted for a third consecutive month in March, but the decline was slower than in February and the decline in new orders arrested.South Korea’s purchasing manager’s index compiled by Markit/Nikkei was 49.5 in March, from 48.7 the previous month.The 50 mark separates contraction from expansion – the index was last above this level in December but only just, with a reading of 50.7 and in only three months last year did it expand.However the survey showed that production decreased at a slower pace than in the first two months of the year, and the accompanying report by Nikkei said that new orders had stabilised. “Meanwhile, buying activity picked up, reversing the decline seen in the previous month,” it added.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:Operating conditions at South Korean manufacturers worsened at a weaker rate at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Production contracted at a slower rate, supported by a stabilisation in new orders.Amid reports of higher raw material prices, cost pressures intensified for the first time since August 2014 in March. Despite this, manufacturers continued to lower their selling prices due to increased competition and price negotiations with clients.
187;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-31T20:50:05Z;Chinese join the mega-dealmakers’ club;Outbound M&A takes off as business leaders grow in status;A new class of Chinese dealmaker has joined the global heavyweights of mergers and acquisitions — business leaders with the connections, confidence and backing to pursue their own multibillion-dollar takeovers, and even gatecrash others.In an otherwise lacklustre quarter for M&A activity, it was the bids and bargaining from China’s biggest companies that drove the country’s cross-border deals to record highs, even as previously red-hot US takeover activity fell to a two-year low.China’s appetite for overseas assets helped push the overall value of cross-border M&A to $311bn — representing a record 46 per cent of the $682bn in deals in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Chinese deals, at $101bn, accounted for roughly a third of that cross-border activity, an all-time high.They also took China’s percentage of total global M&A activity to its highest in any quarter: 15 per cent of deals in the period involved an overseas Chinese acquirer.China’s dealmaking surge helped to mask a 29 per cent fall in deal value in the US, to $256bn, as M&A activity was slowed by sharp market volatility in January. Europe’s first quarter values improved on the year before, however, rising 11 per cent to $181bn.For a handful of politically-connected Chinese business leaders — such as Anbang Insurance’s Wu Xiaohui, ChemChina’s Ren Jianxin and HNA Group’s Chen Feng — the takeover successes of early 2016 have served as an induction into an elite club of global dealmakers: those capable of consecutive billion-dollar deals in a matter of months.In several cases, the businessmen have asserted their status with higher bids for existing takeover targets — upending previously agreed deals, often with superior, all-cash offers.That tactic was best highlighted in March by Anbang’s chairman, who stepped into a months-old deal between Starwood Hotels & Resorts and rival US hotel group Marriott International. Earlier this week, an emboldened Mr Wu raised his all-cash offer to $14bn for Starwood, heaping greater pressure on Marriott to increase its cash-and-stock bid. Despite repeated questions about the source of his funding and warnings from the Chinese insurance regulator, Mr Wu then attempted to put to rest questions over his ability to pay, telling Chinese media he had Rmb1tn in assets.However, the Chinese group pulled its offer late on Thursday. (The figures in this story were compiled before Anbang informed Starwood on Thursday that it was pulling its $14bn offer.)Anbang’s original bid for Starwood came just one day after it had secured a $6.5bn deal for 15 prime US luxury hotel properties owned by private equity group Blackstone.“You get extra points for certainty right now because we are closer to a ‘risk-off’ than a ‘risk-on’ market,” explains Michael Carr, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs, who says this partly explains why Chinese companies are winning the fiercest bidding wars.In February, ChemChina succeeded in the the biggest outbound acquisition a Chinese company has made to date with its $44bn all-cash buyout of Swiss agrochemical company Syngenta — the largest-ever takeover in the chemical sector. It came a mere four months after chairman Ren finalised a $7.7bn takeover of Italian tyremaker Pirelli.Chinese aviation and logistics conglomerate HNA Group also returned to the market in the first quarter, agreeing to buy US electronics distributor Ingram Micro for $6bn in February. Just months earlier, group chairman Chen Feng had added US-listed aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings for $2.6bn and closed a $2.8bn takeover of airport operator Swissport last year.But this spate of deals has not been solely based on the personalities of the chairmen themselves. Experts say low interest rates, coupled with a growing reliance on in-house investment banking expertise on the mainland, have enabled the wave of first-quarter deals.“Now they have the liquidity and sophistication to do this,” says Raghu Narain, head of corporate advisory at Natixis. “These leaders have been able to amalgamate the resources that have allowed them to go out.”China’s central bank has cut interest rates six times during the past year and a half, lowering the cost of bank financing. In addition, mainland regulators have recently granted permission, or so-called “road passes”, for multiple companies to hunt down the same takeover target.In November, Beijing Enterprises Water Group, Beijing Capital Group and China Everbright International, were all found to be competing for German waste management company EEW. Beijing Enterprise won the contest in February for $1.6bn.Miranda So, a Hong Kong-based partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, says: “A ‘road pass’ may not mean exclusivity for a Chinese buyer, as we have seen cases where a second Chinese buyer enters bidding for the same asset.”Even as M&A activity slumped in the US, the trend of large corporates seeking to lower their US tax bills by acquiring an overseas-headquartered rival remained prevalent.For example, US conglomerate Johnson Controls agreed a $20bn reverse takeover of Ireland-based Tyco International — a deal that would have the same effect as a so-called ‘tax inversion’.Meanwhile, US company IHS agreed to combine in a $13bn all-stock deal with UK-based financial information provider Markit in a deal that would create a corporate information powerhouse based in London — and also lower its tax bills.Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan’s head of M&A in North America, said deal activity had slowed down in certain sectors such as healthcare and tech, which were very busy in 2015, while others — such as financial services and industrials — have picked up.Bankers say one area that remains ripe for further dealmaking is the consumer sector, which produced some of last year’s blockbuster transactions but saw relatively little dealmaking activity in the first quarter.Jens Welter, head of consumer and retail group at Credit Suisse, says the buyers are there.“Strategic acquirers continue to be very confident and those that pursue a specific strategy are being rewarded when it comes to M&A . . .” he says. “Overall, the larger deals that captured the headlines last year were highly complex and relied on intricate structures. Some of that will continue to happen in highly consolidated sectors.”Private equity dealmakers made it through tough conditions in the debt markets in early 2016 to secure not one but two $10bn-plus buyouts by the end of the first quarter, writes Joseph Cotterill.But in a twist that reflects the dominance of Chinese outbound dealmaking, the biggest buyout was Chinese insurer Anbang’s $15bn cash offer to take Starwood Hotels of the US private. However, the Chinese group pulled its offer late on Thursday, said people familiar with the matter.Classic private equity buyout groups were not bidders.One of the big four private equity groups, Apollo Global Management, was involved in the next-largest buyout: the $12bn acquisition of home-security group ADT. Apollo is known for its unusual skill in navigating tough debt markets to leverage deals.Raising debt finance proved difficult as investors nursed losses on oil and gas company bonds and became unwilling to buy into junk bonds and leveraged loans, making buyout financing more volatile.This year Carlyle cut the price it could pay for Veritas — the biggest buyout announced in 2015 — to $7.4bn as banks struggled to sell the debt attached to it.In a reflection of these conditions, Apollo had arranged fully committed financing before it announced its cash offer for ADT, including a relatively large slug of equity — $4.5bn — from funds and co-investors.Thanks to those two large deals, private equity-backed M&A in the first quarter surged to $52.9bn by volume, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters — a 36 per cent increase on the same period last year.Take out these two deals, though, and the total is only $25.5bn — lower even than the $29bn recorded in early 2015, which at the time was the slowest three months for buyouts since 2009.“In January and February we were all getting a bit worried,” said Karan Dinamani, a partner at Allen & Overy. “But in the last two weeks, several processes have started.“Whether that translates into deal activity remains to be seen.”In Europe $1bn-plus deals — such as EQT’s buyout of travel company Kuoni and KKR’s acquisition of a unit from Airbus — suggest private equity dealmaking may be on the mend. Last year’s $4bn buyout of LeasePlan, a Dutch car lessor, was also successfully financed in March.“The tone has definitely improved, as the success of LeasePlan showed,” said Klaus Hessberger, co-head of financial sponsors for Emea at JPMorgan.But in some situations “you might see a little less leverage and a little more equity being used”, he added.
188;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-25T13:28:30Z;Markit chief’s persuasive skills needed for bet on IHS tie-up;The $13bn merger will create a new force in the world of specialist financial market data;Lance Uggla, Markit’s charismatic chief executive, was once asked if his UK data company would consider taking over the administration of Libor, the bank lending rate hit by a rigging scandal.His answer was typical of the 53-year-old Canadian’s passion for the $5bn company he built from nothing in just 15 years: “I don’t know the answer but if we did, I know we’d be really good at it.”Such enthusiasm will be needed to make a long-term success of the $13bn merger between Markit and its US counterpart IHS, announced this week.It will create a new force in the competitive world of specialist financial market data. IHS will dominate the board of the combined company, which will be based in London. And from 2018, Mr Uggla will take over as chief executive when Jerre Stead, the 74-year-old boss of IHS retires.Mr Uggla’s success at Markit is down to a mixture of his own infectious enthusiasm and a voracious appetite for deals.A former credit trader at TD Securities, he co-founded Markit to sell banks difficult-to-value credit data. Executing nearly 30 deals in 12 years has turned Markit from a provider of niche data into a small empire offering data, analytics, outsourcing and derivatives trade processing in off-exchange markets.His skills of persuasion will be needed for his biggest bet. There are few overlaps between IHS and Markit. The former provides benchmarks, analytics and data in commodities, energy and the automotive sectors. Cost savings will be a relatively meagre $125m by the end of 2019.Instead the deal will be about cross-selling services used by Markit’s 3,500 clients into IHS’s 50,000 customers. In theory it should give Markit more cash to invest and compete with rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.Deutsche Bank cautioned about too much diversification. “We worry that in three years when the merger benefits are realised, the increased scope of the products being sold to the larger client list will dilute the sales focus,” it told clients.Markit brings closeness to the financial markets and deep expertise in data management and analytics. I am very excited about this as our two firms share so much in commonThis is where Mr Uggla hopes to persuade the doubters. “It would take me a decade to get even 5 per cent of their customer base,” says Mr Uggla. “Markit brings closeness to the financial markets and deep expertise in data management and analytics. I am very excited about this as our two firms share so much in common.”He had mixed feelings about Markit’s 2014 listing in New York. Many of its banking shareholders were keen to sell down their stakes. But typically, he used the equity currency from the float to strike Monday’s deal.His enthusiasm for Markit’s services has won him affection in the industry, even if Markit insiders say it creates a demanding standard to live up to. Even so, customers rarely complain about Markit’s service.Markit has been hurt by the European Commission’s investigation into whether it was involved in collusion in the credit default swaps market. However, it has faced no charges in the five-year old probe. Last December, 13 investment banks were cleared because of a lack of evidence. Markit maintains it ”believes it has acted properly and will continue to co-operate fully with the commission”.Away from business, London-based Mr Uggla is a keen outdoor sportsman and enjoys skiing, sailing and following the progress of his home town Vancouver Canucks’ ice hockey team.

The Office for National Statistics noted that, when measured on a three-month to three-month basis, this has been the longest run of consecutive decreases since 1991.Melanie Richard, head of retail at the ONS, said stores had also reported “sales of their new spring & summer collections were hit by the cold and wet weather last month”.Earlier on Thursday, Next, the retail chain, lowered its forecast for sales this year and warned that consumers may be reducing spending on clothes in favour of going out more.Consumer spending has been the main driving force behind the UK’s economic recovery so the regular retail sales data are closely scrutinised for any loss of momentum.Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon, the research firm, said spending will “lose its vim this year” due to the government squeeze on spending and signs that the pace of hiring is slowing.Much of current spending is driven by low prices — the value of goods bought rose by only 1.4 per cent on a year ago. This reflects the supermarket price war and the legacy impact of the historic strength of sterling making imports cheaper.Sterling has weakened considerably this year but it will take time for the impact on prices to feed through.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, thought the growth rate in retail sales was likely to slow slightly by the end of the year. He said: “I think we will all look back on this last year and think ‘why were we so downbeat when we had it so good?’”

Any reading above 50 indicates growth.Economists had forecast a manufacturing reading of 51.4, 53.3 for the services sector and 53 for the composite index in March.The eurozone economy expanded by a steady but unspectacular 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year and Markit economist Chris Williamson said growth in the first quarter is likely to be similar. He said:“The eurozone saw renewed signs of life at the start of spring. The March PMI showed a welcome end to the worrying slowdown trend seen in the first two months of the year, putting the region on course for a 0.3% expansion of GDP in the first quarter. “The German economy looks to have expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter, but France remains close to stagnation despite seeing a return to growth in March
191;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-22T08:38:18Z;German manufacturing PMI slips to 16-month low;;A pattern is emerging here. Germany’s services sector ended the first quarter on a solid footing but manufacturers had a disappointing March, similar to a pattern in neighbouring France.The closely-watched German manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a survey of activity in the sector – dipped to 50.4 for March compared to 50.5 the previous month – a 16-month low. The services PMI improved to 55.5 from 55.3 in February.Economists had been expecting a reading of 50.8 for the manufacturing sector and 55 for the services sector. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.The composite PMI, which combines services and manufacturing readings, held steady at 54.1, the same as in February, although January recorded a more robust reading of 54.5.Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit which complies the PMIs, warned growth in the eurozone’s biggest economy is likely to remain “sluggish”. He said:Today’s flash PMI results signal ongoing growth of private sector output in the euro area’s largest member state, despite the pace of expansion failing to accelerate from February’s five-month low. Moreover, it looks as if momentum in the German economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead, as slowing new order growth was accompanied by the weakest increase in backlogs of work since the summer of last year. Furthermore, there are signs that subdued demand is now also affecting the labour market, as the rate of job creation eased to a near one-year low.
192;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-22T08:06:16Z;French manufacturers suffer weak March, services better;;"France’s manufacturing sector slipped into contraction territory in March, according to a closely-watched gauge of activity.The latest purchasing managers’ index for France’s manufacturing sector has slipped to a seven-month low of 49.6 for March, down from 50.2 in February. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction.However there was better news for the services sector, which returned to growth. The services PMI, a survey of activity produced by research group Markit, improved to 51.2 from 49.2 the month before and a five-month high.Economists had been expecting a manufacturing reading of 50.2 and 49.5 for services.Despite the weak March outcome for French manufacturers, the composite index, which combines services and manufacturing survey data, rose to a five-month high for March, of 51.1, up from 49.3 in February.Markit economist Jack Kennedy said:The French private sector economy ended the first quarter on a more positive note, reversing the dip in output seen during February. The latest data showed broad-based output growth across the manufacturing and service sectors, alongside strengthening optimism among service providers.
However, there were also pockets of notable weakness, such as manufacturers’ new orders and employment, which both fell. Overall, PMI data suggest a further modest rise in GDP during Q1, doing little to suggest any break from the sluggish growth pattern seen during recent times.Today’s PMI readings are “flash” or preliminary readings."
193;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-22T02:33:23Z;Japanese manufacturing activity shrinks for first time in 11months;;"Pass them another arrow; manufacturing activity in Japan contracted during March and to its lowest level in at least three years.Nikkei-Markit’s ‘flash’ manufacturing PMI fell to 49.1 this month, from 50.1 in February. That is the lowest reading for the data series, according to Bloomberg data going back to March 2013. Markit’s numbers go back further, and suggest this is the worst result since late 2012.The result is below the threshold of 50 that separates expansion from contraction, and fell short of the expansion to 50.5 economists forecast.The previous time the index was in contractionary territory was April last year, while its most recent high level was 56.6 in January 2014.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, noted that production and new orders both contracted, while output decreased for the first time in almost a year. “This suggests industrial production will continue to fall,” she said.“One of the key drivers behind the decline in total new work was a slump in international demand, as new export orders decreased at the sharpest rate in over three years. As a result, goods producers cut back on input buying and were less confident in hiring additional workers,” she added.The Bank of Japan in its recent policy statements has said the country continues to “recover moderately”, but notes business investment and industrial production had been sluggish. On the plus side, the consumer has remained resilient and employment has held up, the BoJ has said."
194;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-21T18:45:47Z;IHS deal moves Markit away from credit market origins;The two companies hope to create new products to challenge Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters;Lance Uggla, Markit’s irrepressible chief executive, has long spoken of his ambition to be “the best of the biggest financial data providers”.So it was with great disappointment that he lost out in a last minute $5bn bidding war with Intercontinental Exchange for Interactive Data Corp last October.However, in the background he had already begun talks about a combination with US data provider IHS, a company he had long admired and held brief discussions with more than two years ago before Markit’s listing in New York. Soon after the IDC defeat, Mr Uggla intensified negotiations with his counterpart Jerre Stead at IHS.The two deals could not be more different. If Markit had acquired IDC, it would have emboldened the company’s march on financial data and reliance on selling to big banks, its largest customers. The $13bn combination with IHS, announced on Monday, moves Markit into an array of corporate data and analytics removed from its credit market origins.The two companies are betting that armed with IHS’s specialisms in energy, automotive, commodities and chemicals data, London-based Markit can create new products and form the basis for a new $30bn-$45bn challenger to Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters.The deal is the largest in a spree of financial and corporate information deals over the past two years as the value of market intelligence — with billions of dollars of trades and loans tied to proprietary data — has soared.In addition to ICE, the London Stock Exchange Group bought Russell Investments for $2.7bn, Bloomberg bought Barclays’ index benchmarking business for about £520m and Verisk Analytics’ bought Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn in March.“In the world we live in, information is key. How you value an asset, create indices, do valuations . . . it can help people to make decisions,” said Mr Uggla. “Every time you have a piece of content, you can make money in different ways. And what’s more important is that our customers demand this content.”The deal is also being cast as another alternative to Bloomberg. People familiar with the talks said IHS, with its 50,000 corporate customers, had looked at every option in financial services and “liked the contrarian nature to Markit”. Mr Stead said he “was fascinated by what [Mr Uggla] was doing, so impressed with what we had found as an attack mechanism to a huge market growing quickly”.The combined company, IHS Markit, would make about $3.3bn in revenue, producing $1.2bn of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It will be headquartered in London.“Each company offers unique, sophisticated, decision-making information that should enhance each other’s product lines and be appealing to each other’s client base,” said Douglas Taylor, managing partner at Burton-Taylor International Consulting. “This deal could create a significant and major future player in the space.”In particular Markit can sell its managed IT services to new clients. “It would have taken me a decade to build 5 per cent of their customer base,” said Mr Uggla.Nevertheless it will also have to assure analysts and investors about the combined company’s long-term growth. In the last year organic growth at Markit has fallen from 8.9 per cent to 3.8 per cent as it instituted price reductions in its derivatives processing product and recorded lower primary loan issuance volumes. IHS recorded organic growth of just 2 per cent last year, although the subscription-based business that accounts for the majority of revenues was a more healthy 5 per cent.The new company expects to realise cost synergies of $125m over time. In comparison, the LSE’s all-share deal with Deutsche Börse is expected to realise €450m in three years. Shareholders will instead be offered a $1bn share buyback in both 2017 and 2018.To that end, US management will dominate in the early years. The 74-year Mr Stead will be the chief executive until his retirement in December 2017, when Mr Uggla steps up from president. IHS will also have a majority on the board, allowing IHS to control the integration process.One person familiar with the talks said that there will be $3bn-$5bn in cash flow available over the next three years.Equally, if Mr Uggla was looking to expand, he has also been wary of becoming prey to a big exchange. The industry has been pursuing its own frenzied merger and acquisition activity since last summer. Deutsche Börse, for one, had briefly considered a bid before it pursued merger talks with the LSE.“Exchanges are not happy being just exchanges any more. They want to be in the content space,” said Mr Uggla. Already traders are speculating that a rival exchange will launch a counterbid and Markit shares rose 11 per cent to $32.75 in New York. But while exchange attention is turned on the LSE, Mr Uggla has stolen the first move.
195;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-21T18:03:11Z;Lance Uggla: Markit force driving the mega-merger with IHS;Canadian has built business by consolidating assets that serve niche parts of financial markets;Markit’s mega-merger with IHS to create a $13bn data provider based in London bears all the hallmarks of Lance Uggla, the UK group’s chief executive and co-founder.The 53-year old Canadian has built a formidable business by consolidating assets that serve niche parts of financial markets and carried out more than 30 deals since its inception over a decade ago.Known for his infectious enthusiasm, Mr Uggla started Markit when he left TD Securities in London as head of global credit trading to start a business selling data on hard-to-value credit swaps to banks.Through acquisition, it has branched out into pricing, valuation and risk data for often opaque financial markets from fixed income and over-the-counter derivatives markets.His ambition has been for Markit to become the “best of the largest” financial information companies but not all his takeover approaches have been successful. He was beaten in his attempt to buy LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house, in 2012 by the London Stock Exchange Group.His achievements have been recognised — he was Ernst & Young’s UK Entrepreneur of the Year while fellow chief executives such as Michael Spencer of ICAP are friends. British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the world wide web, is one of his inspirations.The decision to make London the combined IHS/Markit’s headquarters and Mr Uggla the chief executive-in-waiting is also significant. The UK capital has been Mr Uggla’s home for 20 years and he did a postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics. He follows Arsenal football club and regularly cycles down traffic-choked Oxford Street on his commute from his house to Markit’s City headquarters.Nevertheless, he remains equally affectionate to his home country. Each year he returns to the country to go skiing while Canadian names and mementos are splashed through Markit’s London office. He also watches the progress of his home town Vancouver Canucks ice hockey team.
196;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;IHS/Markit: defensive deal;Consolidation among banks and exchanges makes this logical;"At first glance Markit and IHS make an odd couple. One is focused solely on the financial services sector, best known for exotic niches such as credit-default swaps and the bespoke derivatives market. The other centres on industrials, including transport, energy and resources companies, the latter two accounting for around half of total revenues historically.That may be why the proposed all-share merger between the two information providers contains virtually no equity premium, once the debt is subtracted. The limited overlap in markets and clients means the back-office savings needed to finance such a premium, at $125m, are fairly small.For both companies, the strategic rationale is defence rather than attack. Energy-focused IHS rode the wave of the commodity supercycle, still its biggest division by earnings despite acquisitions in the automotive sphere. Faced with a prolonged downturn in the resources sector, a merger with Markit is the latest part in that diversification strategy. The new company, in which IHS shareholders will hold 57 per cent, will earn a third of its revenues from financial companies. It will also be less dependent on the US than IHS is.The deal has defensive merits for Markit, too. Faced with cost-cutting at banks, its main customers, IHS gives Markit access to new markets in energy, defence and transport.Harder to fathom is why the new company feels the need to pledge a $2bn share buyback over two years, beginning in 2017. True, both companies had bought back stock in the past. But even using their optimistic assumptions for free cash flow of $900m in 2017 (it was $760m last year) buybacks on the scale proposed mean additional borrowing. On a pro forma basis, the combined entity start life with net debt of just under three times projected 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, thanks to IHS’s bigger debt pile.The buyback will also straddle a leadership change; IHS chief executive Jerre Stead will be handing over to Markit’s Lance Uggla at the end of 2017. The company says that increased ebitda, cash flow and moving the domicile to the UK will allow it to retire debt quickly. Maybe. But company integrations are tricky at the best of times. Best to wait until Mr Uggla steps up before splashing the cash.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
197;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-21T17:14:18Z;IHS and Markit merge in $13bn all-share deal;The merger is the latest in a flurry of transactions in financial information and data analytics;Data providers Markit and IHS are to combine in a $13bn stock deal to create a financial and corporate information powerhouse to challenge Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters.The merger is the largest in a wave of takeover activity among market intelligence companies over the past two years, bringing together Markit’s proprietary credit market data with IHS, which is best known for its energy, commodity and transportation sector analysis.Shareholders in US-based IHS will own 57 per cent of the combined company, while investors in London-headquartered Markit will hold the remainder.It will also allow IHS to relocate its corporate tax base to the UK, in a politically controversially manouevre known as a tax inversion. A feature of the boom in mergers and acquisitions, the move allows a US company to capture a lower tax rate by using a takeover to move its domicile overseas.IHS said some operations would remain in Englewood, Colorado, where it is based, but added that its anticipated tax rate would be in the “low-to-mid 20 per cent range” after the deal.For Markit and its founder Lance Uggla, the deal is the latest step in its remarkable rise from a start-up formed by a group of credit derivatives traders at TD Securities in 2001 from a shed in St Albans, the leafy London commuter belt town.After Markit listed in New York in 2014, it intensified a hunt for further acquisitions, but its most recent effort failed in October after a last-second bid by Intercontinental Exchange during a $5bn battle for Interactive Data Corp, a valuer of illiquid credit products.Talks between Mr Uggla and Jerre Stead, chairman and chief executive of IHS, intensified soon after that, according to people close to talks.“Markit is perfect for IHS. It’s not anchored to a specific desktop product in the way that Bloomberg or Reuters are, so it won’t be hit by the cost cuts taking place at banks,” said one person close to the deal.The companies said they expected cost savings to be as much as $125m within three years of closing. The merger is also a bet that Markit will be able to write new products to sell to banks with access to IHS’s data.If successful, the companies intend to use future cash flow to make further acquisitions in attempt to challenge larger rivals such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. The companies added that they would repurchase $1bn in shares in 2017 and 2018.Mr Stead, who will be chairman and CEO at IHS Markit until his retirement at the end of 2017, said: “In all my years of business experience, including leading seven public companies and serving on 35 public company boards, I have never seen a transaction with as much value-creation potential as with this merger.”“At the heart of our shared vision is the opportunity to offer our customers a broader and richer content set through both existing and new products that will support their critical decision making and manage regulatory change,” said Mr Uggla, who will serve as president until Mr Stead’s retirement and then assume his chairman and CEO roles.A new 11-member board will include six IHS representatives and five from Markit. The deal is structured so that IHS shareholders will receive 3.5566 common shares in IHS Markit for each share they own.Shares in Markit jumped 10.7 per cent to $32.64 just after midday in New York, while IHS climbed 6.7 per cent to $118.13.At least one adviser, not involved in the deal, suggested Markit might be a more natural takeover target for ICE, which has said publicly that it is considering a rival bid for the London Stock Exchange Group. There is a break fee amounting to 3.5 per cent of each company’s market capitalisation at the time of signing the deal.Other big acquisitions in the market data space over the past year include Bloomberg’s £520m purchase of Barclays’ index benchmarking business, Verisk Analytics’ agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn, and McGraw Hill Financial’s $2.2bn deal for SNL Financial.IHS was advised by M Klein and Company, a boutique bank founded by former Citigroup dealmaker Michael Klein, and Goldman Sachs. Markit was advised by JPMorgan Chase.

Congress is pursuing efforts to impeach Ms Rousseff, last week a judge blocked her move to appoint former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to her cabinet and published incendiary recordings from tapped phone conversations, while protestors have flooded the streets.The Ibovespa has climbed 19.4 per cent so far in March, putting it on track for its best month in 16 years, since 1999.Shares in Petrobras, the state oil company from which the corruption allegations that threaten to topple Ms Rousseff originally stem, have been among the biggest winners from the recent rally, surging more than 90 per cent over the last month.Shares in steel group Usinas Sider Minas have risen 123 per cent over the last month, buoyed by the triple boon of the politics fuelled rally in Brazil, the recovery in emerging market assets and the rebound in metal prices.Meanwhile shares in telecoms group Oi have skidded 50 per cent over the last month after a deal for Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s investment firm to bolster it with a $4bn cash injection fell through.And as investors look to gain exposure to Brazil’s rally, ETFs tracking Brazilian assets have enjoyed 13 consecutive days of inflows, according to Markit data.First two charts courtesy of Bloomberg.
199;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-21T12:15:35Z;Lance’s point will be to tip balance of IHS Markit;Combination of the City prices group and US-based IHS has a defensive look;Lance Uggla admires Malcolm Gladwell, the sage with the mushroom cloud updo who believes that when ideas reach a “tipping point” they gain unstoppable force. The founder of City prices group Markit, whose hairstyle is of the easycare variety, is talking up its $13bn combination with IHS of the US in similar terms. But the deal could be a more obvious tipping point for his own career.To rise from founder of an outhouse start-up to heir apparent for the top job at a multinational data group in 13 years is impressive. A deal billed as a “merger of equals” is set to loft the former credit trader into the middle ranks of well-paid US chief executives.The transaction has a defensive look, reducing the chances either Markit or IHS will be picked off by a predator. Both have their challenges: slowing organic growth in the case of London-based Markit and hefty exposure to oil sector clients for IHS.The combination gives Mr Uggla the chance to become a consolidator. He will join the IHS board with the expectation he will replace boss Jerre Stead in late 2017. Even bearing the ill-defined role of president, he may be able to lead deals of the kind that have propelled the growth of Markit.The project has big risks for Mr Uggla and shareholders in both groups. NYSE-listed IHS is larger than Markit and is paying a small premium to the undisturbed spot price of its Nasdaq-quoted shares. There may be some resistance within IHS to his succession.Analysts doubt whether revenue synergies can be harvested as easily as forecast cost savings of $125m, even if energy barons have an interest in credit default swap rates they lacked before oil price falls raised their chances of going bust.But Mr Uggla has already defeated odds that vanquish most would-be City entrepreneurs. These find fewer potential customers take their phone calls when they no longer work for a big bank or broker. Spotting an opportunity, such as unquoted securities data, is one thing. Creating a viable business from it is another. If this deal flies, its unstoppable force will be Mr Uggla’s ambition as much as the idea that the value of data are multiplied by aggregating it.King Tantalus was tortured by being immersed up to his chin unable to drink. Edi Truell must have felt similar frustration as a director of Tungsten, the Aim-quoted electronic invoicing group he founded. The City wheeler dealer suggested all kinds of deals to the board, but was rebuffed.Mr Truell, who is an adviser on pensions to London mayor Boris Johnson, has now resigned. This gives him a clearer shot at proposing a combination of Tungsten with businesses he controls, such as Tantalum, a telematics business whose name is derived from that of the thirsty mythological figure.Mr Truell is offering Tungsten a 25 to 30 per cent stake in a private group in return for its assets, or a loan note alternative.The enlarged group, with a mooted value of £400m-£500m, would also include a Lloyd’s data group and electronic invoicing companies which Mr Truell would acquire to complement Tungsten’s business.The board describes his plans as “universally without merit”. That sounds like a No. It would certainly be neater if Mr Truell offered a premium to buy Tungsten. Instead, the deal could leave investors holding an indirect, illiquid minority stake in a business they did not control.Mr Truell has done some good deals in his time. But unlike another mythical figure, King Midas, not everything he touches turns to gold. Regulatory hostility to his brainchild, Pension Insurance Corporation, prevented the company capitalising on the run-off of final salary schemes in the way envisaged. Tungsten has seen its share price fall from 225p to 56p after it gave up plans to buy a big insurer. The scepticism of the board is justifiable.Snuggles may be the first hamster dignified by a death notice on FT.com. The rodent’s passing was mentioned in an article on the resignation of owner Nick Wood as boss of Pets at Home.Directors of the retail chain are required to declare their pets publicly to prove their dedication to the critter-nurturing cause.Mr Wood is succeeded as chief executive by retail division boss, Ian Kellett, pictured in PR shots with two hungry-looking dogs.Do either of them know anything about Snuggles’ sad demise? At least Mr Kellett does not possess a snake. Rumours of foul play would be rife if it was flaunting a hamster-shaped bulge.As it is, conspiracy theorists will note that Mr Wood’s departure is sudden and follows worries about declining flea powder sales (no, really). Supposedly he doesn’t want to commute to Pets at Home’s Handforth HQ any more. If you’ve ever visited Handforth you’ll know that is a credible cover story.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com

It floated on Nasdaq in June 2014 and its shares have risen nearly 10 per cent during its life as a public company.In recent months many of Markit’s long-time bank shareholders, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, BNP Paribas and Royal Bank of Scotland, have sold down tranches of their shares.More on Markit’s website here.

The next worst was the second quarter of 2008 when they returned -2.32 per cent.These record losses coincided with yields dropping to record lows following the launch of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme.Last year proved to be the worst 12-month stretch for triple-A euro corporate bonds since 1999 with returns of -0.52 per cent. Record bond losses and unprecedented bond stimulus seem curious bedfellows.

Flows into eurozone corporate bond ETFs have accelerated to levels never seen before, with records dropping like dominoes.Last week $949m, flowed into eurozone corporate bond ETFs, a record weekly inflow, according to Markit data.That record may not last long; yesterday saw the largest ever one-day inflow, as investors pumped $545m into these funds, writes Joel Lewin.Not yet half way through the month, March has already broken the previous record monthly inflow, raking in $1.9bn.Most eurozone corporate bond ETFs enjoyed record breaking rallies on Friday, the day after the ECB unveiled its souped up easing programme.The iShares Core Euro Corporate Bond ETF- the largest in the category with assets under management of $7.05bn- jumped 1.74 cents or 1.4 per cent on Friday, its largest ever one day rise by a long way.Chart courtesy of BloombergMost analysts think there is much, much more to come.Suki Mann, an independent strategist, formerly of Société Générale and UBS who runs CreditMarketDaily.com, says:The potential for ECB action and its size and longevity is unprecedented in corporate bond market history (the BoE hoovered up just £3bn or so of bonds, less than 2% of the outstanding market at the time).Q1 is going to be good, and we expect issuance, tighter spreads and investors scurrying around to get risk on board will all sustain a good feel-good factor and a positive tone through the second quarter.Read more: Draghi effect lingers in European credit, cramming down yieldsECB stimulus sparks wave of bond sales"
204;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-11T11:35:58Z;Credit markets bounce as ECB extends QE;;Credit markets have reacted well to the news that the European Central Bank plans to begin buying corporate bonds in June as part of its quantitative easing programme.The cost of buying insurance against default, known as a credit default swap, has fallen by more than 10 per cent for both investment grade and high-yield bonds.The spread on European investment-grade CDS has fallen by 20 per cent over the last two days — 13 per cent so far today — according to data provided by Markit.For high yield bonds the spread on CDS has fallen by 9 per cent so far today and 13 per cent since Wednesday.However, analysts remain uncertain about the effects of the change and describe the market as “volatile” as investors attempt to figure out exactly how the bond buying programme will work.The ECB has said it will buy investment grade bonds from eurozone companies, and investors are questioning how it will select these bonds as well as what effect this will have on their ability to buy and sell these bonds easily if the ECB buys a large amount of these issues.Secondly, analysts are expecting a “large technical component” to the market with those bonds which are included in the asset purchase programme trading at a much higher valuation to similar ones which are not.Here’s Barnaby Martin at Bank of America Merrill Lynch:With an explicit mention of corporate bonds today by the ECB, we suspect most sectors will rally over the weeks ahead. But the genuine outperformers should be IG non-financials, French and German credits (chart 4) and utilities, transport, energy and basic industrials sectors (chart 5). We highlighted the helpful trickle-down effect to corporate hybrid spreads, due to ECB action, earlier in the week.High-yield – while not eligible to be bought – should rally in sympathy (and improving relative value to IG). Senior bank debt should also tighten amid a healthier credit market, in addition to support from new 4yr TLTROs.Reverse Yankees (US issuers in Euros) have been the new phenomenon over the last year. These will not be eligible for ECB purchase, so should relatively lag, although down the line there may be more free-float in these bonds for investors to buy.
205;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-10T17:26:21Z;Eurozone credit market surges on ECB policy unveiled;Central bank’s quantitative easing package to include corporate bonds under €80bn monthly purchases;Eurozone credit markets enjoyed their biggest rally in more than a year on Thursday after the European Central Bank unveiled a monetary easing package that involves buying highly rated corporate bonds for the first time.The sharp rally in prices, which move inversely with bond yields, came as a welcome development for a market that has been pressured this year by concerns that negative interest rates will hurt earnings, and from slowing global growth prospects. The ECB said corporate debt will form part of its expanded monthly bond buying programme of €80bn, with the programme increased from €60bn after its policy meeting.The expansion of the ECB’s stimulus programme marks the latest of a series of attempts to stoke inflation and spur growth. The foray into corporate debt is seen as being likely to spur greater debt sales by companies — which have been lacklustre so far this year — potentially boosting capital investment.Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at Hermes said: “I think it’s going to drive primary issuance [of corporate bonds],” he said, adding that it creates more space for merger and acquisition and shareholder-friendly activity, such as share buybacks.Credit default swaps, often traded as a liquid proxy for corporate bonds, staged their biggest advance in more than 12 months at the prospect of the ECB entering the €900bn investment-grade debt market as a regular buyer.The Markit iTraxx Index dived 11.5 basis points to a low for the year of 81 bps, indicating a large drop in the cost of insuring eurozone corporate bonds against the risk of default.“The ECB has very much taken the ‘kitchen sink’ approach, surprising market expectations in a variety of ways,” said Mitul Patel, head of interest rates at Henderson.The riskiest class of bank debt, which has sold off sharply this year, posted robust gains on Thursday. A Deutsche Bank additional tier 1 bond, which is exposed to losses when the bank’s capital falls below a certain level, rose 2.3 per cent to 82 cents on the euro. A UniCredit bond climbed nearly 5 per cent to 83 cents.Share prices for leading eurozone banks initially surged, before later easing. The Stoxx 600 banks index jumped as much as 5 per cent, only to trim gains before closing up 1 per cent.Markets were reassured by the announcement of four new targeted longer-term refinancing operations, designed to boost lending and support monetary policy, in addition to the decision to buy investment-grade corporate bonds.The operations will allow banks to borrow from the ECB at levels potentially as low as the interest rate on the deposit facility, which was reduced by 10 basis points to minus 0.4 per cent. This means banks can effectively be paid to borrow.However, some analysts were unconvinced by the ECB’s new measures.“It’s a sign of desperation,” said Markus Allenspach, head of fixed income research at Julius Baer. “It’s more of the wrong medicine, and it weakens the credibility of the ECB.”He added: “[Draghi] would like to weaken the currency but have the minimum impact on banks — the combination doesn’t make sense. He’s not stimulating lending, he’s making things more expensive for the banks.”
206;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-10T13:50:27Z;CDS prices dive as ECB eyes corporate bonds;;The cost of insuring eurozone corporate bonds against default has dropped sharply after the ECB unveiled expanded its quantitative easing programme to include them.The iTraxx index compiled by Markit, which tracks investment grade credit default swaps, is on track for its largest one-day drop in at least a year. The index has dropped 11.5 basis points to a low for the year of 81bps, writes Joel Lewin.Indices for credit default swaps – contracts that protect against the risk of a bond defaulting- are often used as a proxy for trading corporate bonds due to their greater liquidity.The sharp decline in CDS prices indicates corporate bonds have been given a sizable boost by the ECB’s new easing measures.Toby Nangle at Columbia Threadneedle Investments called the move to buy investment grade corporate bonds “the most important aspect of the ECB decision”.He added:This decision gives the ECB the potential to become the most significant participant in the €900bn European non-financial corporate bond market.While the ECB actions are unlikely to transform the economic outlook, they are in keeping with the central bank’s ambition to cheapen funding costs for companies that seek to invest, and reduce the incentives to save rather than spend.CDS prices have dropped sharply over the last month as credit markets have rebounded from heavy selling in January. The index has dropped 45bps since the start of February. CDS prices have also fallen steeply for banks and junk rated companies.The index for senior bank bond CDS has dropped 12bps to 78bps, while the index tracking high yield CDS (the iTraxx Crossover) has dropped 37bps to 340bps, its sharpest drop in at least six months.Charts courtesy of Bloomberg
207;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-09T15:41:03Z;Fears of lower interest rates drag European insurance bonds down;Insurers suffer worst start to the year of any major corporate bond sector;Insurance bonds have suffered the worst start to the year of any major corporate bond sector in Europe, highlighting fears over the impact of negative rates on the industry.Investors who bought the iBoxx euro insurance index have lost money in 2016 — the only sector among 12 in Europe to post a loss so far, according to Markit data. The index has returned minus 0.6 per cent, compared with a 1.2 per cent return for the iBoxx corporate index.Insurance companies, like banks, issue bonds to fund their businesses and meet regulatory requirements. In February, bonds and equities in both sectors fell dramatically before recovering some of their losses. The insurance portion of the Stoxx Europe 600 index is still down nearly 13 per cent this year.Some insurance bonds have weakened markedly. An Aviva subordinated bond is trading at 88.6 cents on the euro, down from more than 95 cents at the start of the year. A £600m Legal & General bond is trading at 88 pence on the pound and has lost more than 7 per cent of its value in 2016.The bonds have suffered from a high correlation with banks. Market participants also suggested the prospect of lower interest rates has contributed to continued weakness in the sector.“Everyone’s focused on the bank industry for negative rates — I’m not sure if everyone’s focused enough on the insurance industry,” said one trader. “If the yield on anything you can buy gets lower and lower, your ability to fulfil your contracts gets constrained.”Low interest rates affect insurers in two ways. Insurers know they will have to pay out money many years into the future, and must constantly estimate the value of those obligations today. A lower interest rate affects that calculation, making the size of the liabilities larger in today’s money.“Low yields are most material for life insurers — in particular those with long-dated interest rate guaranteed business,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Jon Hocking in a note this week. He added that “those insurers for which the negative yields debate is most relevant include AXA, Aegon, Allianz, Delta Lloyd, Generali, Munich Re, NN, Storebrand and Swiss Life.”The other way that low rates hurt insurers is by limiting the returns on their investment books. Insurers hold large asset portfolios, usually in government and corporate bonds, to back the guarantees they have made. Low rates mean that when assets mature, the proceeds can only be reinvested at lower yields.Over the past year or so, insurers have been trying to balance the need to achieve better yields with the requirements of the EU’s Solvency II rules which apply high capital charges for riskier assets. Many have done this by moving into illiquid assets such as infrastructure and real estate loans. However, even the yields available in these areas have declined as demand has outstripped supply.Some investors have suggested that the sell-off makes some insurance bonds look attractive. “The big opportunities in sterling are in the subordinated insurance space,” said Anthony Smouha, an investor at Atlanticomnium.
208;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Faltering services sector points to slower UK growth;Boardrooms spooked by Brexit and global market fears;Britain’s dominant service industry suffered its sharpest slowdown for nearly three years in February, in a sign that market uncertainty is starting to hit the real economy.City economists rushed to downgrade their forecasts for first-quarter growth in response to the much weaker than expected purchasing managers survey. Recent manufacturing and construction surveys have also been disappointing.Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the results did “not make happy reading” and that the “pervasive sense of a slowdown in growth, alongside the risk of Brexit uncertainty hampering activity” had led him to cut his growth forecast.Allan Monks, economist at JPMorgan, said that with the production industries in the doldrums, the economy was reliant on domestic demand and the service sector to deliver growth, but the “very weak” services data were a big concern.With less than two weeks until the Budget, Chancellor George Osborne last week took the unusual step of warning there could be more spending cuts ahead.Revisions to official data before Christmas showed that nominal GDP — the value of the economy without adjusting for inflation — was lower than thought.The latest Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers fell steeply to 52.7 in February from 55.6 in January — its weakest since March 2013 and well below trend. However, any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said businesses were worried by signs of slowing demand but “boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of Brexit, financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad”.Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, noted that recent official data also showed a sharp fall in business investment, suggesting the economy “may not be as resilient to [Brexit] risk as some had been hoping, particularly in a volatile global environment”.The composite PMI — which combines the manufacturing, construction and services data — is now at a nearly four-and-a-half year low and signals overall UK growth of only 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year.One of the main questions for policymakers, said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser at the EY Item Club, is whether the surveys indicate a genuine slowdown “or are merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year”.The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee is currently unanimously voting for rates to remain on hold, but the weaker results would boost those who favour a rate cut.In a note to clients, Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the PMIs were now in what would be considered “rate cut territory”.While the markets are not pricing in the first rate rise for three years, many economists believe it will happen early next year.Samuel Tombs of Pantheon said the survey was “exceptionally weak” but that with low unemployment and the weaker pound likely to start to lift inflation “the economic recovery likely will have to grind to a complete halt for the MPC to cut rates this time”.Less than 50 per cent of survey respondents said they expected their businesses to grow over the next 12 months, although only 8 per cent expected a contraction.Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments company World First, said there were “simply too many all-encompassing questions that need answering for businesses to feel that they have a solid foundation to grow”.He added: “So, for now, expect the engine of UK economic performance to tread water, at best.”

It was also an improvement on an earlier flash reading of 52.7.Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while anything below 50 indicates contraction.The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, fell to a 12-month low of 53, in line with expectations. Combining manufacturing and services, Germany and Italy both clocked their smallest expansions in five months, while France and Spain expanded at the slowest pace in 13 months and 14 months respectively.Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, said:The slowdown in growth of business activity, accompanied by a similar easing in the pace of job creation and the steepest fall in prices charged for a year, suggest that the region’s recovery is losing momentum. The broad-based disappointment ups the odds of the ECB acting aggressively to avoid another downturnFrance’s service sector was the worst performer, dropping to 49.2 from 49.8, its lowest reading since November 2014.Markit said:Anecdotal evidence suggested that some clients had chosen to postpone spending in the face of an uncertain economic environment.Germany’s services sector reading actually improved slightly, rising to 55.3 in February from 55 in January, among the strongest months of expansion over the last five years, a welcome development after the manufacturing sector suffered its worst reading in 14 months.Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit said the reading:offers some relief and suggests that the eurozone’s largest economy is not performing as poorly as signalled by the manufacturing numbers earlier this week. Trends in the two sectors are clearly divergingHe also said “occasional mentions of the inflow of refugees having a positive effect on demand for certain services”.Crucially, service providers managed to raise prices at the fastest rate since May 2012 despite input cost inflation continuing to slow.Italy’s services sector also registered a slight improvement, coming in at 53.8 compared with 53.6 in January. It was the twelfth consecutive month of expansion.However, there were signs of trouble on the horizon, with business outstanding suffering the steepest drop in 14 months and future expectations weakening. Average prices charged by service sector businesses fell for the fifty fifth consecutive month, declining at the steepest rate in 11 months.Markit’s Phil Smith said:The survey’s price indices suggest that headline inflation is set to remain low, with cost pressures subdued by falling fuel prices and average tariffs down againRead Spain’s services sector PMI result here.
210;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
211;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-03T09:31:57Z;UK services growth weakest since March 2013 – Markit;;Growth in the UK’s dominant services sector cooled significantly in February and recorded its weakest rise in activity since March 2013, according to a well-respected survey. The disappointing result has raised fears that GDP growth could weaken to 0.3 per cent, or less, in the first quarter of this year.The UK services purchasing managers’ index, produced by research group Markit, dropped unexpectedly to 52.7 for February from 55.6 the month before. Economists had been expecting a reading of 55.1. Sterling dropped 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.4030 after the PMI was published at 9.30am UK time.The far worse-than-expected services sector PMI comes after two similar surveys keeping track of activity in the construction and manufacturing industries also fell well short of expectations, raising fears that the UK economy will once again have to rely heavily on a weakened services industry for growth in the first quarter of this year, writes Nathalie Thomas.The UK construction PMI for February, published yesterday, fell to a 10-month low as activity in Britain’s residential housebuilding sector recorded its weakest rise since June 2013.The manufacturing PMI, published on Tuesday, dropped to a 34-month low as economic uncertainty weighs on the industrial sector.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the survey, said:The slowdown in February leaves the PMI surveys suggesting that economic growth could weaken to 0.3% in the first quarter, but there are downside risks to even this modest expansion.Despite rising slightly from January’s three-year low, business confidence in the service sector remained at a level which has historically presaged an imminent slowing in the economy to near stagnation or worse in coming months.While Britain’s industrial and construction sectors are small compared to the services sector (they account for 15 per cent and 6 per cent of GDP respectively), economists make the simple point that all sectors need to grow. The UK economy expanded by 0.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 but the services sector did all of the hard work.Any reading in the PMI surveys above 50 indicates growth.

The reading slowed from 54.6 in January, but was above economists’ expectation of 54.0.Markit’s Andrew Harker said:While the latest set of PMI data for Spanish services companies paint a broadly positive picture of the state of the sector, there are some headwinds which appear to be limiting the scope for growth. The most obvious of these is political uncertainty, which was linked to a dip in sentiment as well as a slower expansion of new business in February as some clients operate a wait-and-see approach before committing to new projectsEarlier this week, Markit also said the growth in country’s manufacturing sector had slowed in February, with the PMI for that sector slipping to 54.1 from January’s 55.4.Taken together, the composite PMI was 54.5.

Nonetheless, the outlook remains bleak after two years of recession, with service providers reporting lower outstanding business for the 63rd consecutive month and continuing to lay off employees in an attempt to cut costs.Samuel Agass, an economist at Markit, said:“[T]here are still plenty of headwinds for the sector to overcome until consistent economic growth can be achieved. Workforce numbers are sliding and companies continue to report a deterioration of outstanding business levels. At the same time, the weaker exchange rate continues to drive up costs and paces pressure on firms’ operating margins.”
214;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-02T12:17:38Z;Economic uncertainty hits UK construction industry;PMI survey shows housing activity at two and a half year low;Uncertainty about the economic outlook has hit the UK construction industry, with activity falling to a 10-month low.The survey is more unwelcome news for George Osborne, the chancellor, as he prepares for a difficult Budget this month.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers fell to 54.2 in February, the weakest since April 2015 and well below the average 57.6 for 2015. However, any reading above the 50 mark still suggests activity is increasing.The housing sector, which has been the main driver of growth over the past few years, fell to a two and a half year low.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said companies were reporting that clients were “hesitant” to commit to projects, even though the underlying business conditions remained favourable.He said signs of companies reducing hiring and buying materials at a weaker rate indicated they were “preparing for an extended period of softer growth this year”.Business confidence in the sector also fell to a 14-month low.Sterling remained close to a seven-year low after the publication of the data, which were weaker than the City expected.On Tuesday, the PMI figure for manufacturing fell below its long-run average for the first time in three years as overseas orders weakened.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey was “generally disappointing” and the sector was “clearly vulnerable to confidence among clients being pressurised by heightened UK and global economic uncertainties”.Mike Chappell, managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial, said Brexit remained the “great unknown” for many companies.“Many construction firms generate the bulk of their revenues in the UK but also rely on a steady stream of skilled workers from the EU. They are therefore considering how a vote to leave the union might impact these current arrangements.”In February, the Bank of England downgraded its inflation, growth and wage forecasts. It is likely the Office for Budgetary Responsibility will have to do the same at this month’s Budget.Last week Mr Osborne warned that Britain “may need to undertake further reductions in spending”, though he gave no sense of the scale of the tightening envisaged.Even with all the gloom, Britain’s economy is still forecast to be the fastest growing in the G7 this year thanks to resilient consumer spending and the strength of the service sector.The equivalent survey for Britain’s dominant service sector, published on Thursday, will be closely watched for signs of weakness.
215;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-02T09:35:32Z;UK construction sector growth hits 10-month low;;The rate of growth in the UK’s construction sector hit a 10-month low in February, according to a closely-watched gauge of activity.The UK construction purchasing managers’ index for February dipped to 54.2 from a reading of 55 the month before. Although any reading above 50 indicates growth, the outcome for February is a nasty surprise for economists who had expected an improvement in the survey to 55.5.According to Markit, which produces the PMI, the latest reading was dragged down by a particularly poor performance from the residential housebuilding sector. February recorded the weakest rise in housing activity since June 2013, the data group said.The pessimistic construction survey comes after the latest manufacturing PMI, published yesterday, fell to a 34-month low.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said:Survey respondents noted that underlying business conditions remained favourable, especially in relation to commercial building and infrastructure-related work, but some clients had been hesitant to commit to new projects so far in 2016. Reflecting this, new order growth weakened again and construction firms were the least optimistic about their year-ahead growth prospects since December 2014.Britain’s industrial and construction sectors are small compared to the country’s dominant services sector (they account for 15 per cent and 6 per cent of GDP respectively) but their progress is being closely watched as they held back overall growth in the final quarter of last year.The economy expanded by 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, as the services sector did all of the heavy lifting.
216;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-02T08:33:35Z;Grocers are Europe’s most shorted stocks;Energy stocks second on list as bets on darkening corporate outlook grow;It used to be that grocery retailing was one of the steadiest parts of the business world. Supermarket habits change slowly and, whatever the economic context, people always buy vegetables and washing powder.Yet the grocers have become the most popular target for short selling hedge funds in Europe, as the sector struggles to adjust to falling consumer prices, discount rivals and the march of online rivals: Amazon this week announced a deal to work with UK chain Morrisons, for instance.Their struggles though are just the latest sign of rise in bets that a number of corporate prospects face a turn for the worse. Energy companies and makers of healthcare equipment are the next most shorted sectors after a turbulent two months which has encouraged the professional pessimists.“The recent market volatility has seen short sellers return to the market in a way we haven’t seen in a couple of years”, says Simon Colvin, research analyst for Markit.What they tend to look for are companies whose profits will fail to match expectations, either from changes to the structure of a particular market, or a turn in the business cycle.J Sainsbury is the second most shorted stock in the Stoxx 600 index, according to Markit, and UK rival Tesco is the 19th, in a list otherwise dominated by companies exposed to the Chinese economic cycle.“Supermarkets are pressured on three sides — price deflation, the rise of the discounters Aldi & Lidl, and the steady flow of money online,” says Fraser McKevitt of Kantar Worldpanel, a research group.Carson Block, the prominent US short seller, has also attacked Casino, a French Food retailer which is not a member of the Stoxx 600, raising concerns that years of overseas expansion have left the company with too much debt.Sainsbury was a target for short sellers long before it announced a controversial bid for Home Retail Group, the owner of a chain of UK catalogue stores, with at least 15 per cent of its shares loaned to hedge funds throughout 2015, according to Markit.So-called short sellers borrow stock in a company to sell in the market, with the hope of buying it back at a lower price in the future, before returning shares to the lender and pocketing the difference.Such short bets can be placed to offset potential losses on other investments, or to bet outright a company’s stock is overvalued, and so can be a sign of broader market concerns.The proportion of the Stoxx600 index out on loan is 2.6 per cent, up from 1.9 per cent a year ago. The short interest in food retailers and consumer staples companies is 7.7 per cent, according to Markit, up from 4 per cent a year ago.The most shorted stock in the broad European index is Swatch, with 29 per cent of the group’s shares out on loan as of Tuesday. The Swiss watchmaker faces competition from Apple’s smart watch as well as the impact of any downturn in Asian markets.Anglo American, the third most shorted company, illustrates the dangers of shorting.The mining group’s market value has more than doubled in recent months, a rebound after the heavily indebted group’s share price collapsed from almost £33 in 2011 to £2 at the start of this year.Alexander Altmann, European equity trading strategist for Citi, says high short interest “can be a contrarian bullish indicator around earnings or any catalyst where the shorts might quickly be proven wrong”.“Some of the most shorted have been some of the best performing sectors year to date,” he adds.For instance, the Stoxx 600 oil and gas sub index is up by 0.7 per cent this year in a falling market, despite investor pessimism.Short interest can also be a sign of overall market positioning. Strategists at JPMorgan split the US market into so-called defensive and cyclical companies, and compares the amount of short bets against each.In the run-up to the 2008 recession, the difference between the two rose as investors positioned for the downturn, says Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan.“The difference now is more elevated than 2011. In a way, what is embedded in investor expectations is an even more cyclical downturn than during the European debt crisis”, he says.However, short interest can also indicate an imminent stock market reversal. Hedge funds which trade market momentum using computer-based strategies can reinforce the violence of market moves as they both pile in and then are forced to get out of their bets in unison.Mr Panigirtzoglou says: “That's what happened in October, they went from being very short at the end of September to very long in October.” Markets bounced dramatically as sentiment turned.For investors contemplating the direction of the European market, the potential for problems in industries exposed to a slowdown is clear cause for concern.Yet in a year when concerns about the financial sector have been in renewed focus, they represent a notable absence. The list of 20 most shorted companies, and 10 most shorted sectors, does not contain any banks.Additional reporting by Mark Vandevelde
217;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-02T01:39:42Z;South Korean manufacturing remains in doldrums;;South Korea’s manufacturing sector is still shrinking, according to the latest PMI reading for industry in the country. South Korea’s purchasing manager’s index compiled by Markit/Nikkei was 48.7 in February, from 49.5 the previous month.The 50 mark separates contraction from expansion – the index was last above this level in December but only just, with a reading of 50.7. In only three months last year did it expand.The Bank of Korea has stood pat on interest rates in recent months, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent, following four cuts between last August and June. But the economic slowdown in China is a problem for Korea and exporters are battling sluggish growth worldwide.Earlier this morning, data showed Korean industrial production weakened in January.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said of the PMI release:The latest survey data pointed to worsening operating conditions in the South Korean manufacturing sector in February.Production contracted at the sharpest rate since August last year, suggesting the official rate of decline in manufacturing production will accelerate from December’s reading of -1.8% (year-on-year).Total new orders also declined at a quicker pace, helped by a decrease in new export orders.
218;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T11:10:52Z;Economic worries take toll on UK manufacturing activity;Decline pronounced in output and new orders reported by manufacturing companies, for consumer and investment goods;Activity in UK manufacturing sector has fallen below its long-run average for the first time in three years in a sign of the difficulties companies face in a fragile global economic environment.According to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index on Tuesday, a combined score of output, orders and employment, stocks held and delivery times was 50.8 in February, down from 52.9 in January and below the long-run average of 51.5 for the series for the first time since April 2013.The big decline came in output and new orders, particularly for consumer and investment goods.The PMI index does not translate directly into official figures for manufacturing output, which has fallen by more than 1 per cent over the year to December, but suggests there is little relief in sight for the struggling sector.Manufacturing accounts for 10 per cent of total UK output and is suffering from weak oil production and lower demand from commodity producing countries.Manufacturers said the drop in output in February was broad-based in weaker export orders from the US, Europe, Brazil and Russia.Price pressures are declining, however, as falling oil and commodity prices push input costs down.The figures were compiled before David Cameron’s negotiation of Britain’s membership terms of the EU and so do not include any change in sentiment from sterling’s sharp decline in foreign exchange markets.Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit, which compiles the surveys, said the breadth of the slowdown was the greatest cause for concern. “The domestic market is showing signs of weakening while export business continued to fall,” he said.Daniel Vernazza of UniCredit said sterling’s decline was unlikely to have the normal positive effect on manufacturing exports since it is clouded by uncertainty over Britain’s membership of the EU. The effect of a weaker currency “could even be negative” as it adds to uncertainty.George Buckley of Deutsche Bank noted that the drop in the UK index pushed this measure of economic health back below the equivalent eurozone measure, suggesting the UK must keep relying on services to outperform the single currency area.Nevertheless, he cautioned that although manufacturing’s importance was dwindling, “changes in the manufacturing and service indices are correlated so falls in the former could show up in an easing in the latter”, which has been performing strongly in recent months.Any decline in the service sector figures to be published on Thursday would heap pressure on George Osborne as he prepares for the Budget in just over two weeks, suggesting the economic backdrop for deficit reduction is significantly worse than at the time of the Autumn Statement last November.
219;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T09:10:23Z;Eurozone manufacturing hits a soft patch;;The eurozone’s manufacturing sector is in slightly brighter shape than previously thought, but growth has still slumped to a 12-month low.The purchasing managers’ index for the euro area, a broad measure of health encompassing hiring patterns, inventories, and the like, clocked in at 51.2 for February, in the final analysis, a shade above the 51 seen in previous estimates but comfortably below the 52.3 level recorded in January. Still, at over 50, today’s reading means the sector has been expanding for 32 months in a row.Said Markit (in a statement that you can read here):Manufacturing production rose at the slowest pace for a year, as rates of expansion in new business and new export orders eased to the weakest since April 2015 and January 2015 respectively. Job creation was registered for the eighteenth month running, but the rate of increase in staffing levels eased to a 12-month low.Greece is declining again after a pick-up from the ugly lows of last summer, while Ireland is at a two-year low in its pace of expansion.Says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit:With factory output in the eurozone showing the smallest rise for a year in February, concerns are growing that the region is facing yet another year of sluggish growth in 2016, or even another downturn.Lacklustre domestic demand is being compounded by a worsening global picture. Exports either fell or rose more slowly in all countries surveyed with the sole exception of Austria.With all indicators – from output and demand to employment and prices – turning down, the survey will add pressure on the ECB to act quickly and aggressively to avert another economic downturn.
220;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T09:01:46Z;Italian manufacturing growth at 12-month low;;Italy’s manufacturing sector is feeling the pinch from weak growth in the eurozone, as expansion in the sector slowed more than expected in February, slumping to a 12-month low.The purchasing managers’ index for Italy’s manufacturing sector – a closely-watched gauge of activity – dropped to a reading of 52.2 in February, a 12-month low, from 53.2 the previous month. The figure was marginally weaker than the 52.3 reading expected by economists.Markit, which produces the PMI survey, said output rose at the slowest rate for over a year in February, reflecting a further easing in the pace of expansion in new orders. There was also “a further sharp decrease in manufacturers’ purchasing costs amid lower global commodity prices.”Phil Smith, Economist at Markit , said:February survey data confirm that the manufacturing sector has started 2016 on a softer footing. Growth rates for both output and new orders waned further from the highs seen late in 2015, while manufacturers’ buying levels failed to rise for the first time in over a year.Factory employment moved higher again in February, though for job creation to continue in months to come we can ill afford to see the upturn lose any more momentum. Falling costs at least provides manufacturers with breathing space to lower their charges to support sales, with 2016 set to be another highly competitive year on the pricing front.(Chart from Markit)
221;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T08:22:29Z;Manufacturing rebounds in Poland and Hungary;;Manufacturing in eastern Europe rebounded strongly in February, significantly exceeding most economists’ predictions.Hungary’s purchasing managers index (PMI) improved to 54.8, according to data compiled by Markit, up from 53.0 for January. Poland rebounded from a seven-month low to 52.8 against a drop to 50.6 predicted by economists, writes Max Seddon.The Polish gains were driven by a surge of new orders, growing at the fastest rate since last July, as well as export growth, a rise in production, and an expanding workforce.Turkey, however, struggled with a drop to 50.3 over a fall in exports, partly hit by the ongoing geopolitical standoff with Russia, as purchasing activity rose and output costs hit a four-month high.Trevor Balchin, Markit senior economist, said signs were promising for sectors in both countries, although they remain vulnerable to external factors:Output and new orders both rose at the strongest rate in seven months in February according to the survey data, signalling that the official growth rate will pick up. But with eurozone and global growth showing signs of slowing, the longer term outlook for Poland’s goods producers remains uncertain.In Turkey, he added:there was a further loss of momentum since the end of last year, as the regional geopolitical landscape continued to undermine export demand. Reflecting weak growth of new work, firms adopted a cautious approach to purchasing activity.
222;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T06:08:19Z;Russian manufacturing in ‘fragile state’;;Russian manufacturers reported a worsening state of affairs for business last month.The PMI compiled by Markit was 49.3 in February, compared to expectations of 49.5 and 49.8 the prior month.It is the third month in a row the sector has shrunk, as the Russian economy is hammered by economic sanctions, capital outflows, a depreciating rouble and falling consumer demand.Samuel Agass, economist at Markit, said:Russian manufacturing sector conditions remain in a fragile state, highlighted by February’s headline PMI posting below the 50.0 threshold for the third successive month.Disappointingly for goods producers, scrutinising the survey data leaves little encouraging news. Workforce numbers continued to slide while outstanding business was depleted at a sharp pace. Although there was a slight expansion in new orders, albeit underwhelming, export orders contracted at the quickest rate in 19 months, highlighting the difficulty facing Russian goods exporters at present.
223;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T05:12:45Z;Indian manufacturing sector continues expansion;;The Indian manufacturing sector grew for a second month in a row in February, pulling away from a difficult spell in November when it shrank.The Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers index for manufacturing came in at 51.1 in February, unchanged from January’s reading. A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, and this is therefore the second month in a row above that expansionary threshold.In December the reading was 49.1.Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit, said of the survey:The Indian manufacturing economy edged further in the right direction during February, eking out modest gains in new orders and output.However, these positive developments failed to feed through to the labour market and staffing numbers were left unchanged. Although businesses saw a stronger rise in new work, data implied that this was partly driven by price reductions.
224;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-03-01T02:12:10Z;Japanese manufacturing holds steady in Feb;;"Japanese manufacturers had a steady time of it last month and the sector is still expanding, but sluggish international demand is a major headwind.The final reading for the Nikkei-sponsored PMI series was 50.1 in February, compared to 52.3 a month earlier.The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction, so the reading represents a stabilisation, says Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, the group which compiles the survey. However it is also the lowest reading in eight months, and poor international demand means firms are reluctant to take on more workers:She adds:Operating conditions in the Japanese manufacturing sector was little-changed in February, following a solid improvement in January.Contributing to a decline in total new work intakes
was a reduction in international demand, as new
export orders decreased for the first time since last
September. As a result, goods producers cut back
on buying activity growth and slowed down their
rate of staff hiring.Meanwhile, reports of reduced raw material costs
led to a further decline in input prices in February.
Consequently, firms were able to reduce their
charges for the third month in a row."
225;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-26T02:33:15Z;Leap year date confusion leads to derivatives fallout;Trades rejected due to uncertainty over correct conventions under post-crisis market structure;Derivatives traders were left scrambling on Thursday, as the first leap year under the new, post-crisis market structure resulted in trades being rejected due to confusion over date conventions.A typical US dollar or euro denominated interest rate swap has an effective start date two days after it is traded. For Thursday’s date, that start date falls on February 29. A standard contract then has a maturity, or end date, a set number of years later, for instance five or 10 years. The problem arises because the February 29 end date doesn’t exist and will be different from the start date, being February 28 if it is not a leap year.Conventions exist in most markets to handle the impact of leap years but because swaps markets have been overhauled since the 2008 financial crisis, with regulators mandating standardised swaps to be electronically traded and centrally cleared through a clearing house, similar conventions are not as ingrained.Some derivatives trading platforms, called swap execution facilities, complained that the market was left confused due to different expectations of what to do.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, an industry group, published guidelines for leap years in April 2012 in an attempt to build consensus across the market.They state that for all maturities that also fall in a leap year, such as four or eight years later, February 29 should be used. For all maturities outside a leap year, February 28 should be used.“ISDA does not and cannot require market participants to follow these conventions,” said a spokesperson for the industry association. “We are aware that discrepancies have emerged in market practice, and we will engage with industry participants to see whether there is consensus around the need for new conventions.”We are aware that discrepancies have emerged in market practice, and we will engage with industry participants to see whether there is consensus around the need for new conventionsIssues were also raised with Markit, a middleware platform that provides the plumbing connecting trading platforms to clearing houses and transferring trade details between the two.“We are aware of the situation and are working with customers to resolve it,” said a spokesperson for Markit.The situation led to trades being rejected for clearing. LCH.Clearnet, the largest clearing house for interest rate swaps, declined to comment after people familiar with the situation said the clearing house had rejected trades on Thursday due to issues arising from leap year conventions.A spokesperson for CME Group, the other big clearing house for interest rates swaps in the US, said that the clearing house did not experience any rejected trades.

A successful application would put IEX on an equal footing with the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets.Contrary to claims that it is dedicated to protecting investors, Citadel said IEX executes market orders at worse prices than market makers, fails to execute a high percentage of those orders, and charges high fees.“IEX’s demonstrably poor performance, coupled with its efforts to recklessly market to retail investors, should expose the fact that IEX has presented a false face to the public through a carefully crafted marketing campaign,” Citadel said in a fourth letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission opposing IEX’s application.IEX hit back, saying: “The broad range of investor support that IEX has received throughout this process tells the real story about what we have built.”As chronicled in Flash Boys, the book by Michael Lewis, IEX launched in 2013 as a “dark pool” and marketed itself as a cure for unequal US markets, where ultra-fast traders buy data feeds from exchanges and exploit market movements to the detriment of long-term investors.Its bid to become an exchange has been met with hundreds of comment letters from both supporters such as asset managers and critics like Citadel, NYSE and Nasdaq.“The IEX Exchange would bring to market significant features that will create a more level playing field that many institutional investors feel is lacking among the current exchanges,” said Seth Merrin, chief executive of Liquidnet, one of the world’s largest independent block trading venues, in a letter dated this week.These features include limiting order types and not allowing participants to buy fast feeds of trade data, he said.Based on data from Markit for the fourth quarter, Citadel said that IEX offered retail investors spreads of more than double those of other market makers, including Citadel, on market orders. Those are buy or sell orders to be executed immediately at current market prices.Citadel calculated that the wider spreads would cost retail investors more than $1bn if extended over an entire year and applied to all trades.Citadel also said that Markit data showed IEX filled about a third of market orders sent to its trading venue and, based on its own analysis, that IEX charges retail investors on trades that other market makers typically do not.IEX countered that the orders involved in the Markit study were not representative of its business. It said Citadel’s letter “ignores 99.993 per cent of all orders sent to IEX, which represent 99.8 per cent of all IEX volume”.IEX also dismissed comparisons between IEX and market maker fill rates since they are two different types of businesses. Citadel said IEX was not an appropriate venue for retail investor orders.The linchpin of IEX’s strategy is a 350-microsecond delay it says is to offset advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders, but its detractors have argued that it is against rules governing exchanges.
227;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-25T12:43:31Z;Business investment dips sharply;Analysts cite Brexit fears and worsening global economy;Business investment had its biggest fall since 2014 in the final quarter of the year, as the weakening global environment and Brexit jitters hit company confidence. While most economists had expected business concerns in the run-up to the referendum on European membership, Andrzej Szczepaniak, economist at Barclays, said the data suggested “investment started slowing before we had anticipated”.The figures from the Office for National Statistics showing investment falling 2.1 per cent came as a particular disappointment after two consecutive quarters of growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey data provider Markit, said the fall was a “big concern” and businesses were starting to show “increased signs of risk aversion” that were likely to intensify considering the uncertainty around Brexit.“For a sustainable recovery, which involves improvements in productivity and profits, we also need to see business investment revive, something which will only happen when business confidence lifts higher again,” he said. The ONS said much of the fall was driven by asset disposals. Household spending and services kept the overall recovery on track, as growth was confirmed at 0.5 per cent for the quarter, with the economy growing 2.2 per cent for 2015 as a whole.The breakdown, however, will disappoint policymakers hoping for signs of rebalancing. Industrial production contracted 0.5 per cent quarter on quarter, construction output fell 0.4 per cent and manufacturing was flat. Net trade again proved a drag on overall growth.However, the reassurance that the British recovery continued at a solid — if unspectacular pace — settled some market nerves, helping halt the fall in sterling of recent days. All the growth momentum was coming from two familiar sources: the dominant service sector and household expenditure, both of which rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent on the quarter.After a run of slightly weaker than expected data, there had been speculation that overall growth would be revised down, but Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said that “once again, the buoyancy of the services sector has offset the relative sluggishness of the rest of the UK economy”. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments company World First, put it more bluntly in a note to clients entitled “Thank God for the consumer”. With the OECD last week downgrading the growth outlook for all of the G7, and oil prices remaining low, there were few expectations of any immediate pick-up in Britain’s industrial exports. Employee compensation — which includes salaries and pension contributions — increased 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, indicating that firms were increasing their pay bills, which would support consumption.A Treasury spokesperson said while Thursday’s data confirmed Britain continued to see “steady growth”, with recent downgrades to the outlook “it’s vital that we don’t stop working through our plan that’s building resilience and providing an anchor of stability in uncertain times”.

In 2013, it had a market value of more than $22bn, but that has since fallen to $897m.Seadrill offers top of the range, hi-tech oil rigs designed to drill in the toughest conditions, such as the depths of the Arctic Ocean. Since these are the most expensive projects, they are typically the first to be scrapped or put on hold, so Seadrill’s earnings have suffered particularly badly.The company said contracting activity is at the lowest level since the 1980s, a dire outlook that will only get worse in the near future.Seadrill warned:The offshore drilling market continues to be oversupplied with multiple drilling rigs chasing the few opportunities that are available.Oil company capital expenditures are expected to decline further in 2016, following two consecutive years of decline. We continue to believe that the majority of rigs with contracts expiring in 2016 will be unable to find suitable follow on work, many are likely to be idle for a protracted period and consequently cold stacking and scrapping activity will accelerate.However, it maintained an impressively upbeat outlook for the long term, adding:When also considering the eventual demand response to low prices we can expect to see a rebalancing in the oil markets. When the cycle turns we see a strong future for Seadrill’s modern, high specification fleet and highly regarded operational track record.At pixel time the shares are up 6 per cent at NOK14.70.Although the stock remains under pressure, since December short sellers of Seadrill shares have lost their nerve a little. The percentage of shares on loan (a proxy for short selling) has dropped from 15.8 per cent in December to 10.2 per cent this week, according to Markit data.Chart courtesy of Markit
229;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US services sector shrinks for first time since ’13;;The vast US services sector unexpectedly contracted this month, halting a 27-month expansion, the latest sign of slowing growth in the world’s most important economy.Markit’s PMI gauge fell to 49.8 in Feburary, from 53.2 the month prior, widely missing estimates of 53.5. It was the lowest reading since the US government shutdown in October 2013. Readings above 50 point to expansion, while those below indicate contraction.“Reports from survey respondents suggested that softer underlying new order growth and uncertainty about the economic outlook had weighed on business activity in February,” Markit said in its report.However, Markit also cautioned that a snow storm that swept across the US East Coast may have weighed on the reading.The services sector accounts for the bulk of US employment, and until recently has been a bright spot even as other portions of the economy, specifically manufacturing and energy, have faced pressure from sluggish global growth, low oil prices and a strong dollar.Indeed, the data “show a significant risk of the US economy falling into a contraction in the first quarter,” according to Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.The grim data fly in the face of ongoing strength in the labour market that has given economists more confidence that the US economy is not headed toward a contraction.
230;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-22T09:31:54Z;Eurozone manufacturing, services suffer dip;;It was not a great February for the eurozone’s services and manufacturing sectors.Expansion in both the services sector and the manufacturing sector in the eurozone slowed in February, casting further doubts over the strength of the region’s economic recovery.The eurozone Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by data provider Markit, came in at 51.0 for the manufacturing sector in February, sliding from 52.3 in January to a 12-month low. Economists had only expected a more moderate drop to 52.0.The index for the services sector was 53.0 for February, still well within expansion territory, but a 13-month low nonetheless. It was down from January’s reading of 53.6 and below predictions of 53.4.Services and manufacturing combined, the composite PMI, came in at 52.7, compared to expectations of 53.3 and 53.6 in January. This was also a 13 month low.Markit also points out that price declines in the single currency area showed no sign of abating:Deflationary pressures meanwhile intensified. Average prices charged by companies for their goods and services fell at the steepest rate for a year as firms competed to boost sales.Average input costs fell marginally for a second successive month, the first back-to-back monthly decline since the spring of 2013.Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said:Disappointing PMI survey data for February greatly increase the odds of more aggressive stimulus from the ECB in March.Not only did the survey indicate the weakest pace of economic growth for just over a year, but deflationary forces intensified. Economic growth is likely to slow below 0.3% in the first quarter unless we see a sudden uplift in March, which on the basis of the forward-looking components of the PMI seems unlikely. In fact, growth looks more likely to slow further than accelerate.
231;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-22T08:49:59Z;Services sparkle, manufacturing falters in Germany;;"There’s something of a split in Germany’s economy; services good, manufacturing dour.The German Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by data provider Markit, came in at 55.1 for the service sector in February, up a notch from January’s 55.0, a two-month high. Economists had been predicting a drop to 54.7.But hold the champagne. The index for the manufacturing sector, clocked in at 50.2 for February, a 15-month low. It was down from January’s 52.3 and below predictions of 51.9.The composite PMI for the month was 53.8, compared to expectations of 54.1 and 54.5 in January. It was also a 15 month low.Said Pantheon Macroeconomics:New services business is growing briskly, but slowed in manufacturing as export orders weakened. Euro weakness relative to the dollar and pound is not helping Eurozone manufacturers to the same extent as last year, and the recent fall in the Chinese yuan has added to the pressure. As a result, manufacturing employment fell, while it continued to rise in the services sector, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to recent months. Selling prices for manufacturers fell as firms had to cut prices to maintain market share, while they continued to rise in the more resilient services sector.Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at Markit said:The German economy appears to be in the midst of a slowdown, according to February’s flash PMI results. Although the PMI is still signalling an overall expansion in economic activity, the rate of increase slowed for the second month running and was the weakest since last July. The slowdown of output growth furthermore resulted in a more cautious approach with regards to hiring policies, as the rate of job creation eased to the weakest in almost a year.Looking across the two monitored sectors, it is evident that we currently have a two-speed economy. While service providers continued to record solid growth of output and new business, the slowdown in the goods-producing sector intensified, with the headline PMI just about managing to remain above the neutral 50.0 mark. That said, the latest reading was the worst since November 2014 and indicative of a near-stagnation in the sector. Our panellists commented that weak global demand acted as a drag on growth."
232;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-22T08:11:45Z;French manufacturing grows by a whisker;;The French manufacturing sector is flirting with contraction, coming in only a nudge over the mark that separates falling activity levels with growth this month.The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for February, a broad gauge of health compiled by Markit, came in at 50.3, above economists’ expectations of 49.9. It had been 50 in January.This is the sixth consecutive month that the manufacturing sector has been above the 50-mark, but only just, with the highest reading of 2015 being recorded at 51.4 in December.Across the economy the mood was glum. For services, the PMI was 49.8, worse than the 50.3 economists were expecting, and compared to 50.3 in January. The composite PMI for the month was 49.8, compared to expectations of 50.3 and 50.2 in January.The French economy grew 1.1 per cent last year.Jack Kennedy, economist at Markit, said:The private sector economy continues to follow a broadly stagnant path, with first-quarter GDP looking likely to remain sluggish following a 0.2% rise at the end of 2015. The combination of weak demand conditions and strong competitive pressures saw firms’ output prices cut at the sharpest rate in over a year, pointing to continued downward pressure on inflation.On a brighter note, service providers reported improved confidence regarding future activity, with optimism climbing to a six-month high.
233;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-22T02:09:45Z;PMI picture worsens for Japanese manufacturers;;Manufacturers in Japan were feeling more pessimistic this month, despite their central bank taking interest rates into negative territory this year in a bid to boost the economy.The Nikkei-Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 50.2 in February, compared to economists’ expectations of 52, writes Chris Brewer. It was 52.3 in January.Japan’s PMI has averaged 51.4 over the last year and February’s reading is the lowest since last June.Still, at least it is still above the 50-mark which separates contraction from expansion. The last time the index went just below this was in April 2015.But the result is another sign that the Japanese economy is not in recovery mode. It shrank at an annualised rate of 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, worse than expected.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said sluggish global demand was a leading factor in the malaise on Japan’s factory floors:Latest data indicated only marginal growth in operating conditions at Japanese manufacturers. Production increased at the slowest rate in the current 10-month sequence of expansion, led by a marginal drop in new orders for the first time since June last year.Data suggests that the fall in total new work intakes was caused primarily by a contraction in international demand, with new exports declining at the sharpest rate in three years.
234;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Pressure eases on UK households amid low inflation;;With inflation remaining stubbornly low, less than half of UK households expect a Bank of England rate hike in the next 12 months, a significant drop from January which goes hand in hand with a slight improvement in their sense of financial well-being.The Markit Household Finance Index report for February shows the headline index number – which measures households’ overall perceptions of financial well-being – clocked in at 45.3 in February, up from 43.9 in January, the highest since last May. 50 is the neutral level.Although it signals pessimism overall, Markit said the latest reading was one of the highest since the series began in 2009.With inflation remaining low, expectations of an interest rate rise in the next six months have fallen to 22 per cent from 40 per cent last month.Philip Leake, economist at Markit said:Historically low inflation perceptions appeared to be a key factor underlying the optimism. Moreover, workplace activity and income from employment both increased, with growth in the former hitting a five-month high.However, with savings and cash availability falling, and households still concerned about job security, financial pressures look set to persist in coming months.Meanwhile, forecasts of tighter monetary policy were pushed back substantially in February. With policymakers facing low inflation, falling commodity prices and global growth worries, less than half of UK households predict an interest rate rise over the coming year.
235;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
236;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-16T16:44:03Z;Credit default swaps: not a Lehman moment;Comparisons with 2008 are overblown given banks’ stronger balance sheets;Credit default swaps are like parachutes. If bond investors do not use them when the market crashes, chances are they will not be needing them again. If a bond defaults they make up any loss on the principal (but usually not missed coupon payments). And if a bank looks like it is in trouble, the cost of default protection rises.Many asset managers went into 2016 optimistic on banks. But after a 20 per cent drop in the MSCI European Banking index and with nervousness growing about bank balance sheets, CDS prices for subordinated bank debt have risen two-thirds this year (according to the Markit iTraxx index).Despite falling back a little since last week’s panic, prices are still at their highest since mid-2013, and trading volumes are up more than a fifth from the same period in 2015.Deutsche Bank looks the most stressed. One measure of the cost of insuring against a Deutsche default on its five-year subordinated debt hit a new high last week of $525,000 (for $10m of protection).Are CDS the dead canaries in the banking system’s sulphurous mineshaft? Probably not. Volumes are still low by historical standards. It is tricky to buy a CDS specific to a single bank’s debt, so buyers tend to purchase protection against a basket of bonds as the next-best-thing, pushing up the index. It is not a perfect hedge but it is cheaper than crystallising big trading losses on the underlying bonds.Still, prices look high. An actual default on a conventional bond is unlikely. European banks would have to eat through some $283bn of equity raised since 2008, according to figures from Dealogic.They are far better capitalised than even three years ago. Panicky pundits draw comparisons with Lehman Brothers, whose CDS traded between $550,000 and $650,000 in September 2008.That turned out to be a bargain when the bank failed a month later. But while the past week may have felt dicey, this is not 2008 — and Deutsche is not Lehman.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

With the haven appeal of gold revived since the turn of the year, gold ETFs are on track for their largest quarterly inflow in four years, according to Markit data, raking in $5.26bn so far this year.Global equity funds suffered outflows of $6.8bn, taking the total outflows over the last six weeks to $41bn, according to EPFR data crunched by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, topping the $36bn that flowed out during the August sell-off.Riskier bond funds, including high yield, emerging market, bank loans and even investment grade funds also suffered heavy outflows, which have persisted all year.Luke Hickmore at Aberdeen Asset Management says:The surge into safe haven assets like government bonds at the cost of risky assets such as credit and equities have aised the spectre of the dread R-word (yes, recession) in the world’s developed economies.There could be a shake out from this volatility in six months’ time that sees some companies fall over. Now is not the time to be gambling big.Global financial-sector exchange traded funds are suffering their first quarterly outflow since 2010.Emerging market equity funds suffered their 15th consecutive week of outflows, and European equity funds were also hit particularly hard, shedding $1.8bn. Cameron Brandt at EPFR says:Recent industrial output data also suggests that concerns about global growth, the possibility of a British vote to leave the Eurozone and the political strains caused by the immigration crisis are blunting the tailwinds created by low energy prices and the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program.Although European equities have rebounded today, they are still nursing heavy losses this year, and in any case, Michael Hartnett at Bofa Merrill Lynch is unconvinced by the bounce:We remain sellers of any and all counter-trend rallies unless profit/growth expectations can reverse higher or we get a big-bang coordinated global policy responseCharts courtesy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Just a day later, the German lender’s shares are falling hard and its CDS has hit new highs.Deutsche’s 5-year senior credit default swap – a contract that gives protection against the risk of a bond defaulting – has jumped another 34 basis points today to 316bps, putting it on track for a new record high close, writes Joel Lewin. (It briefly flashed above that in 2011 but has never closed higher.)The bank’s 5-year junior CDS (which protects the subordinated debt against default), has surged another 80bps today to 541bps, which would also be a record high close. It has risen 354bps so far this year, indicating a sharp rise in the cost of insuring Deutsche bonds.Investor attention has focused on Deutsche Bank’s contingent convertible bonds, which have dropped sharply, forcing the bank’s management to reassure investors it will have no problem paying the coupons on its “CoCo” bonds.The bank sell-off was given fresh impetus this morning when Société Générale reported disappointing fourth quarter earnings and its shares fell more than 14 per cent. Shortly after, the Riksbank caught the market off guard by cutting rates even deeper into negative territory than expected, raising fresh concerns about the impact of negative rates on banks’ earnings.Financial CDS have been rising sharply across the board as investors seek to protect themselves against further deterioration in banks credit. Standard Chartered’s, for example, has jumped 15bps to a post-crisis high of 234 bps.A Markit index that tracks European financial groups’ subordinated CDS- the iTraxx- has climbed to a three-and-a-half-year high, rising 22bps to 331bps.Charts courtesy of Bloomberg

That puts them on track for the worst quarterly outflow in six years since the second quarter of 2010, according to data from research group Markit.Global financial stocks have been getting clobbered so far this year, amid fears that global growth is slowing and that negative interest rates will eat into earnings, writes Joel Lewin.The Bloomberg World Banks Index has dropped more than 16 per cent so far in 2016.

Global equity ETFs have been hit more broadly, suffering outflows of $10.9bn so far this quarter.

240;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-03T12:35:47Z;Services data brighten outlook for UK economy;PMI survey for dominant industrial sector shows strong inflows of new business;Britain’s dominant service sector shrugged off concerns about the global economy to record another month of solid activity in January.Sterling climbed to a three-week high against the dollar as stronger-than-expected survey figures gave some reassurance that the overall UK recovery remained firm.Strong inflows of new business helped the Markit/CIPS survey of service purchasing managers reach a broadly unchanged 55.6 in January. A reading above 50 indicates activity is increasing.The composite PMI, which aggregates results from the service, manufacturing and construction surveys, rose to a six-month high of 56.If historic relationships hold, this would signal an increase in GDP growth to 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year — faster than the current consensus forecasts.Sam Hill, UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said that the survey was “encouraging”, adding that growth might be moderating but “is still not too bad at all”.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said there was “little reason for concern” about the pace of UK growth, but added there was “increased nervousness” about the potential for global risks to derail domestic expansion.Despite the symbolic importance of the manufacturing industry, services account for more than three-quarters of the UK economy and are the main driver of economic growth.Chris Williamson, chief economist of survey compiler Markit, said that the UK “exhibited signs of fortitude in the face of multiple headwinds in January, with growth edging higher despite intensifying uncertainty about the business outlook”.But despite the strength of the headline figures, there are concerns hidden in the detail of the survey. Mr Williamson said “cracks appeared in the economy’s resilience, as a slowdown in hiring and waning order books raise doubts about the sustainability of such solid growth”.The future expectations index also dropped to a three-year low on what Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payment firm World First, termed a “laundry list of concerns” for 2016. These range from the introduction of the new higher minimum wage to the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.The release came as Lloyds Bank announced that it would cut 1,755 jobs in the UK and close 29 branches as it prepares for privatisation.All these factors are expected to weigh on the Bank of England’s thinking when it releases its updated forecasts for the economy on Thursday, where it is expected to downgrade its figures for growth and inflation.Earlier on Wednesday, economic think-tank NIESR said it was now expecting inflation of just 0.3 per cent this year and pushed back its estimate of the first UK interest rate rise until mid-2016. Markets have gone even further and are not expecting a move until well into 2017.It also forecast that Chancellor George Osborne was unlikely to meet his target of bringing the budget into surplus by 2019-20 without additional tax rises or spending cuts.The chancellor’s chances of meeting his targets for this year will largely depend on the strength of self-assessment tax receipts in January.He is relying on the public accounts enjoying their best final quarter in more than a decade to meet his deficit reduction target set out in the autumn.Pizzas aren’t a part of the services sector / From Christian Cole
241;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-03T09:32:32Z;UK services PMI stages surprise increase;;The UK’s dominant services sector has started 2016 in slightly more robust shape than expected, according to a closely watched survey of activity.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) produced by research group Markit, edged up to 55.6 in January from 55.5 in December. Economists had been expecting a dip in the reading to 55.4.Markit said growth in January was supported by new business but warned that the news was not all positive. The survey indicated the weakest 12-month outlook in three years as businesses worry about a “hard landing” in China, the possibility of the UK leaving the European Union and higher interest rates in the US.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:The economy defied expectations and picked up speed in January, but cracks continue to appear in the country’s resilience to the various headwinds.The three PMI surveys for January collectively point to a slight upturn in the rate of economic growth, consistent with GDP rising at a quarterly rate of 0.6% in the first quarter, up from 0.5% in the fourth quarter, if current levels are sustained. However, order book backlogs are already falling at the fastest rate for almost three years and companies have scaled back their hiring in response to growing uncertainty about the economic outlook at home and abroad.Worries about a Chinese ‘hard landing’, financial market jitters, higher interest rates in the US, more austerity at home and the possibility of ‘Brexit’ and EU tensions have collectively pushed the business mood in the dominant service sector to its darkest for three yearsThe UK economy picked up speed in the final three months of 2015, growing by 0.5 per cent compared to 0.4 per cent in the previous three months, but the services sector – which accounts for 78.6 per cent of total output – did most of the heavy lifting, expanding by 0.7 per cent in the final three months of 2015.Agricultural output also increased but there was a contraction in production and construction, according to a preliminary estimate of UK GDP published at the end of last month.
242;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-03T09:23:28Z;Eurozone service sector makes limp start to 2016;;The eurozone economy has made a “disappointing” start to the year, with growth slowing in both services and manufacturing, and deflationary pressures intensifying, according to a closely-watched survey.The eurozone services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by data provider Markit, dropped to 53.6 in January from 54.3 in December. The composite index, which combines services and manufacturing, dropped to 53.6 from 54.2 in December. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, called the readings “disappointing”, and said they “indicated one of the weakest expansions seen over the past year and raises the prospect of further stimulus [from the European Central Bank]”.He added:Growth of activity, order books and employment all lost momentum, but perhaps most worrying of all from a policymaker’s perspective is the intensification of deflationary pressures. Average prices charged for goods and services dropped at the fastest rate since last March.Growth and inflation have clearly failed to pick up over the past year despite the renewed stimulus efforts from the ECB. This raises the question of whether existing stimulus has simply been insufficient, or whether monetary policy is proving ineffectiveOn a country level, the services industries in Germany, France and Italy all clocked in with disappointing slowdowns in growth.France’s services sector returned to growth after contracting in December, but the rate of growth fell short of forecasts at a “neglible” 50.3 amid “lacklustre demand”.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said “the rate of growth was negligible”, adding:Lacklustre demand continued to weigh on the performance of the sector, with new orders rising at a below-trend pace.An improvement in service providers’ future expectations to a five-month high offered some modest encouragement, but there remains little to suggest that the sector will break out of its persistently sluggish performance amid a fragile business climate.Growth in Italy’s services sector slowed to 53.6 from 55.3 in December, undershooting expectations of a more moderate drop to 54. It’s a chunky drop, but still a respectable rate of expansion after bumper growth in December.Growth in new business and employment both slowed, but business confidence about the year-ahead rose to the strongest level since May 2011.The limp reading comes after data published yesterday showed Italy suffered its first rise in the rate of unemployment in five months in January.Phil Smith, an economist at Markit said:It was encouraging to see new business rise again after a marked gain in the month before, which maintains momentum and should mean that more jobs are added in the coming months. With business confidence also running higher, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the current growth phase is set to continue.Germany’s services sector slipped to a reading of 55, down from 56 in December.However, business sentiment rose to a five-year high, and although activity, new orders and employment growth all slowed, they remained “robust”.Oliver Kolodseike, a Markit economist said:German service providers remained in expansion mode at the start of 2016. Although output rose to the smallest extent in three months, the underlying rate of growth was robust overall, helped by a further sharp rise in new business.Moreover, the level of positive sentiment among businesses reached a near five-year high with almost one-third of the survey panel expecting output growth over the coming year. Panellists commented that expansion plans, higher investments and the low oil price are likely to lead to increased activity.Charts courtesy of Markit

But it has come off the boil. The reading was 55.1 for the previous month.Markit’s Andrew Harker said:The latest services PMI data from Spain paints a broadly positive picture of the health of the sector at the start of 2016, with strong inflows of new work recorded and employment continuing to rise in response to building capacity pressures. That said, growth of activity slowed to the weakest in more than a year and business sentiment eased amid the first reports that the political stalemate in Spain had fed through to uncertainty in the economyEarlier this week, Markit also said the country’s manufacturing sector had a strong start to the year, with the PMI for that sector jumping to 55.4.Taken together, the composite PMI was 55.3.

That’s the highest reading since August, when it hit an almost-two year high of 53.7.Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.The composite index, which combines activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, crept to 52.6 last month from 52.2 in December. A separate survey from Nikkei-Markit on Monday showed the manufacturing sector grew in January, but at a slower pace than the previous month.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:Business activity growth accelerated to a five-month high, supported further by a solid expansion in new orders. With the headline indices remaining positive in both the manufacturing and service sectors, this bodes well for growth early on in 2016.On a less upbeat note, forecasts towards output over the coming year were less optimistic than one month previously, with the degree of sentiment the weakest since October. Some panellists anticipate a fall in international demand in the next 12 months.

Any reading above 50 indicates growth.Apart from the pre-election slowdown seen last year, that’s the worst reading in two-and-a-half years, since June 2013.Job creation slowed to its lowest in almost two-and-a-half years, while construction firms reported the lowest business confidence since December 2014.The disappointing performance of the construction sector is in stark contrast to the manufacturing sector, which got the year off to a good start despite a series of challenges, including heavy rain and flooding in areas where many factories are located.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit said:UK construction firms struggled for momentum at the start of this year, with heightened economic uncertainty acting as a brake on new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since the summer of 2013. Softer growth of house building activity and a more subdued increase in commercial construction were the main factors behind the slowdown.Business confidence appears to have subsided across the construction sector, following the multiyear highs seen in 2015. The latest survey indicated that construction companies are less upbeat about their prospects for growth than at any time since December 2014.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, which co-publishes the PMI, said:Supply chains were weighed down by the pressures of a shortage of bricks and blocks as delivery times became longer in an attempt to fulfil recent orders from last year. Optimism was still high, however, as business expansion plans continued although at a slightly more muted pace.
246;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T13:12:53Z;UK factories boosted by domestic demand;PMI survey shows export orders back in decline;Britain’s factories enjoyed a brighter than expected start to the year, with solid domestic demand keeping large companies busy. The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers hit a three-month high in January of 52.9, up slightly from 52.1 in December. A reading over 50 indicates activity is increasing. However, export orders fell back into decline, with factories reliant on domestic spending and a backlog of previous orders to keep afloat. The renewed fall in the price of oil and other commodities remains a double- edged sword. Businesses linked to the North Sea supply chain are hurting, but the overall average price of input materials fell again, giving companies not exposed to the sector a chance to build. Despite the survey results, analysts remain cautious, pointing to the well-documented struggles of the sector against sterling and weak global demand. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said the detail in the survey showed companies were still getting squeezed. “The general operating environment has become increasingly competitive both at home and abroad as firms scramble to win new customers,” he said. The expansion of activity is being predominantly led by big groups, Markit said, with SMEs remaining under severe pressure. Smaller companies are also likely to be hardest hit by the introduction of the new higher minimum wage from this April. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said there were “conflicting signals” in the data, and questioned whether the sector would regain momentum or if the survey fillip would prove to be a “false signal”. The manufacturing sector made no contribution to overall growth in the fourth quarter, which remains reliant on the dominant service sector. But consumers at least remain in buoyant mood, with the long-running GfK index in the top 10 per cent of all readings since its inception in 1974. Separately on Monday, fresh lending data from the Bank of England showed that although net unsecured consumer credit fell back to a seven-month low in December, the appetite to borrow remains strong. After borrowing an extra £1.5bn in November — the biggest monthly jump since February 2008 — households borrowed £1.2bn in December. But the annual rate of growth is running at 8.6 per cent, well in excess of average wages. However, analysts are not yet worried. At £179bn, the total stock of loans outstanding to individuals is still £30bn below its 2008 peak, reflecting the extent that households paid down debt during the crisis. The BoE's Financial Stability Committee has a range of tools to damp credit growth, and while it is watching certain areas like car finance and buy-to-let very closely, it is relaxed about overall levels of consumer credit. The renewed price of oil has also boosted disposable incomes while receding expectations of interest rate rises mean households are able to borrow at close to record lows. Average mortgage rates for new loans were just 2.55 per cent in December, according to BoE data. While the housing market remains constrained by lack of supply, there was a welcome uptick with mortgage approvals hitting a four-month high of 70,837 in a traditional slow month.Surveyors and estate agents say a lack of stock has been gumming up the market, pushing up prices and causing chains to collapse, so would welcome signs of increased transactions. 
247;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T12:30:28Z;Downturn in Brazilian manufacturing slows;;Last year was not kind to Brazil. Today, new data show that the manufacturing sector was still shrinking in January. But there is a silver lining of sorts.Brazil’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, stood at 47.4 in January, a 11-month high. Although that’s still under 50 level that indicates expansion, it marks a significant upturn in business conditions after the index hit a six-and-a-half-year low back in November.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit says:The latest PMI survey further reinforces the picture of ongoing recession in the Brazilian manufacturing sector. While signs that the downturn eased further at the start of 2016 are a step in the right direction, the industry still has a lot of ground to make up after recording a ‘lost year’ during 2015.With demand still weak, especially in the domestic market, and the ongoing political logjam, the chances of such a revival taking hold soon are slim. While the weak real is at least providing some respite for manufacturers in the form of rising new export orders, the impact of this is being dulled on the cost side through higher raw material import prices.
248;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T09:34:56Z;Greece manufacturing steady in January;;Greek manufacturing activity flat-lined in January, after advancing for the first time in 15 months in December.Greece’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, stood at 50 in January, down from 50.2 in December.The index held the all-important 50 line (readings above 50 indicate expansion, while anything below 50 indicates contraction), and employee numbers in the sector rose a tthe fastest pace since July 2007.Chart courtesy of MarkitHowever, the picture looks a little bit grimmer beyond the headline number. Incoming new orders declined further during January, and volumes of new work have dropped in every survey period since September 2014. New export orders also contracted.Samuel Agass, an economist at Markit says:Goods producers reported a more stable working environment in January, signalling a shift away from the downturn that immersed the sector in 2015. Encouragingly for firms, employee numbers expanded at the quickest pace since July 2007, while input prices fell for the first time in one year.But he also warned:Volumes of incoming new orders continued to struggle, remaining in contraction territory. Likewise, output slipped back into decline while backlogs of work deteriorated further. Until improvements in these areas occur, the prospect of strong economic growth looks unlikely in the coming months.
249;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T09:34:45Z;UK manufacturers start 2016 on decent footing;;The UK’s manufacturing sector has had a better than expected start to 2016, according to the closely-watched purchasing managers’ index (PMI) survey of activity. This was despite a number of challenges, including further heavy rain and flooding in areas where many factories are based.The UK manufacturing PMI, produced by research group Markit, came in at 52.9 for January compared to expectations of 51.6 and a result of 52.1 for December. The reading – a three-month high – remains safely in growth territory – any reading above 50 indicates growth.The manufacturing PMI had been slipping since reaching a 2015 high of 55.5 in October.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit said:The UK manufacturing sector registered an uptick in its rate of expansion at the start of 2016, shrugging off a number of potential headwinds, ranging from global financial market volatility to localised flooding in the north of the country.However he warned that exporters are still finding life tough given the recent strength of the pound. Mr Dobson added:The domestic market remains the key growth driver. In contrast, the trend in new export orders continues to disappoint, falling back into reverse gear in January. Even after recent easing in the exchange rate, a number of manufacturers are still finding that the strength of the pound against the euro is impacting order inflows. Reports from companies also highlight how the general operating environment has become increasingly competitive both at home and abroad as firms scramble to win new customers.The UK economy expanded by 0.5 per cent in the final three months of 2015 – a slight pick-up from 0.4 per cent growth in the third quarter – but the dominant services sector did most of the heavy lifting.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), industrial production – which accounts for just shy of 15 per cent of GDP – contracted 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter.
250;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T09:08:22Z;Eurozone manufacturing ‘misses a beat’;;The purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone’s manufacturing sector has dipped slightly in January, in line with expectations.Markit, which compiles the index, said the region had churned out a reading of 52.3 for January, down from 53.2 in December. Rates of expansion for output, new orders, and new export business all sagged during the month, it said.The regional data follow country breakdowns earlier this morning, with Germany trumping earlier estimates slightly and a bumper 55.4 from Spain, but Italy disappointing.Markit’s chief economist Chris Williamson said:The eurozone’s manufacturing economy missed a beat at the start of the year. Having accelerated for three straight months, the rate of growth slipped from the 20-month high attained at the end of 2015. Growth of order books, exports and output all slowed.If the slowdown in business activity wasn’t enough to worry policymakers, prices charged by producers fell at the fastest rate for a year to spur further concern about deflation becoming ingrained.The survey data signal an annual rate of growth of manufacturing output of just 1.5% at the start of the year. As such, the data are likely to add to pressure on the ECB to expand the central bank’s stimulus programme as soon as March.
251;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T08:55:25Z;France’s manufacturing sector stagnating;;France’s manufacturing sector went nowhere in January, a final reading of the closely-watched purchasing managers’ index (PMI) has confirmed.The country’s manufacturing PMI fell to 50 in January, the crucial dividing line between contraction and growth and five month low. The index had still been in growth territory in December, recording a result of 51.4.According to Markit, which conducts the PMI surveys, new orders fell in January.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit:French manufacturing growth ground to a halt at the start of 2016, ending a run of modest expansion seen towards the end of 2015.A drop in new orders for the first time in four months was the primary culprit, as a generally weak demand climate and client uncertainty continued to weigh on new work inflows. A sharper fall in output prices meanwhile suggests that very weak inflation is likely to persist amid a combination of strong competitive pressures and low commodity prices.France’s economy grew just 0.2 per cent in the final three months of 2015, GDP data published last week showed. This was down from 0.3 per cent growth in the third quarter, showing French president François Hollande still has much to do to revive the economy, which suffered a further setback at the end of last year following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris.
252;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T08:52:07Z;Italy’s manufacturers make slightly disappointing start;;Italy’s manufacturers have had a slightly disappointing start to 2016, according to a close-watched survey of activity.Italy’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index – compiled by research group Markit – came in at 53.2 for January, lower than the 54.8 reading expected by economists and a four-month low. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.However Markit economist Phil Smith said there was still “significant forward momentum” and highlighted falling prices as manufacturers enjoy weak commodities prices. He said:The first batch of PMI data for 2016 showed a cooling in the rate of growth in the manufacturing sector from the sharp pace seen at the end of last year. There remained significant forward momentum, however, with new orders rising broadly in line with average for 2015 and job creation reaching a seven-month high.Furthermore, January saw a renewed decline in producer prices amid cost savings from falling global commodity prices, which should help to stimulate demand in coming months and ensure that the recovery in the sector remains on track.The country’s manufacturers ended 2015 on a high, as the PMI jumped to a much better than expected 55.6 in December, the highest reading since March 2011.However, there have been concerns that Italy’s economic recovery is losing steam. Italy finally returned to growth last year following a bruising triple-dip recession but Confindustria, a group that represents Italian businesses and industry, in December revised down its expectations for Italian GDP growth both in 2015 and 2016, warning that the country was failing to emerge from the “abyss in which it dropped during the recession”.Confindustria expects the economy to have expanded by 0.8 per cent in 2015 – it had previously expected growth of 1 per cent – and 1.4 per cent this year.
253;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T08:35:34Z;Spanish manufacturing starts 2016 with a flourish;;Spanish manufacturing has started 2016 with a bang, racking up the sharpest rise in new orders since February 2007.Spain’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), a survey of factory managers conducted by research group Markit, jumped to 55.4 from 53 in December, overshooting expectations of a drop to 52.5. That’s its highest reading since May.Any reading above 50 indicates expansion, while readings below 50 denote contraction.The falling price of input materials such as oil and steel drove the fifth consecutive month of input price declines, which resulted in the steepest rate of deflation since July 2009.New orders rose the most since February 2007, and “anecdotal evidence” suggests companies expect further new order growth over the coming months, which has lead to them raising stocks of both purchases and finished goods, according to Markit.Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit said:The Spanish manufacturing sector shrugged off uncertainty surrounding the make-up of the next government in January, posting a strong start to 2016. One key highlight was the fastest rise in new business since prior to the economic crisis, while efforts to increase stock holdings point to confidence in the near-term outlook for orders.Falling prices in commodity markets remained a feature of the survey, with oil and steel among the items most widely mentioned by panellists as having fallen in price as input costs declined to the greatest extent in six-and-a-half years.Chart courtesy of Markit
254;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T06:06:29Z;Russian manufacturers feel January chill;;The Russian manufacturing sector is still in contractionary territory, with Markit’s purchasing managers’ index for the sector coming in at 49.8 in January.In December it was 48.7, so this is quite some improvement from them – but not enough to push past the 50 mark which separates contraction from expansion.The Russian economy is being battered by economic sanctions, capital outflows, a depreciating rouble and falling consumer demand. In 2015 the sector shrank in ten out of twelve months.There were some slivers of good news. The survey said that production volumes, which contracted in the final month of 2015, grew in 2016 – and there is anecdotal evidence of new orders flowing in. Samuel Agass, economist at Markit, said:All-in-all, there are still some slightly more encouraging signs to extract from underneath January’s headline figure. However, for the time being, the sector still remains in a sluggish state.
255;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T05:09:54Z;Indian manufacturers expanded by a whisker in Jan;;Indian manufacturing activity grew by just enough to push the sector as a whole back into expansionary territory last month. The Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers index for manufacturing came in at 50.1 in January, from 49.1 in December. A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, so this was essentially the minimum amount of uplift getting it into that category.The PMI reading was as high as 52.9 in January 2014 – but it has been easing lower since then, underscoring the fragility of industry in India despite some predictions that the country could soon become the ‘new China’ in terms of its growth rates.Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit, said of the survey:Whereas the trends in the growth rates are relatively weak in comparison with the long-run series averages, January’s PMI data paint a brighter picture of the Indian economy.
256;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-02-01T02:15:02Z;Japanese manufacturing: growing slowly;;Demand for goods made in Chinese factories may be declining, but not so for their counterparts in Japan. The manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit and Nikkei, came in at 52.3 in January, down from 52.6 in December. It was the lowest reading in three months but still puts the sector in expansionary territory.Production increased for the ninth consecutive month and was stronger, overall, than the series average. Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, added:The start of 2016 was generally positive for the Japanese manufacturing sector, with operating conditions improving at a solid rate. Production and new orders increased at robust rates, helping to boost employment numbers and encouraging firms to purchase more during the month. International demand increased at a faster rate, with panellists mentioning greater trade volumes with Europe and south-east Asia.
257;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-26T11:41:07Z;Euro equity ETFs: on track for 1st outflow since ’14;;European equity ETFs are on track to suffer their first monthly outflow in 15 months, as investors sour on stocks amid the worst start to a year on record.Last year, European equity exchange traded funds raked in a record $53.2bn, more than triple the tally in 2014, according to Markit data, as the European Central Bank’s bond buying programme gave eurozone stocks a lift and stirred appetite for risk, writes Joel Lewin.But European equities have made a bumpy start to 2016, as fears surrounding China’s economic slowdown and the oil rout have hammered markets. Some $216m has left European equity ETFs so far in January, putting them on track for their first monthly outflow since October 2014.Last week European stocks, and global equities more broadly, were given a boost by signals that the ECB is set to ease policy further. But that has proved short-lived, and so far this week, stocks are sliding again.
258;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-22T08:43:40Z;German PMIs: ‘Robust though unspectacular’;;Not the best of starts for German companies. According to a closely-watched survey of corporate activity, both manufacturing and services sector activity slumped to a 3-month lows.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a survey of activity by research group Markit – dropped to 52.1 from 53.2 for Germany’s manufacturing sector for January, from the previous month. Although economists had been expecting the manufacturing PMI to dip, it fell more heavily than the consensus forecast of 53.It wasn’t much brighter in the services sector either, as the services PMI reading came at 55.4 from 56 in December. Economists had been expecting a slightly more modest dip to 55.5.However, both readings are above the 50 level that indicates expansion.Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at Markit said:Germany’s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three-month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy.More from Markit’s website here.
259;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-22T08:04:35Z;French services recover but manufacturing suffers;;Companies in France’s services sector have started 2016 on a better footing, as a key survey of activity indicates the sector returned to growth in January after confidence wobbled in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks at the end of last year. However, activity in France’s manufacturing sector dipped significantly between December and January, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI).The manufacturing PMI for January has dropped to 50 – the critical number that divides growth and contraction – from a reading of 51.4 in December. Economists had expected a much higher reading of 51.3. January’s reading also marks a 5-month low, writes Nathalie Thomas.But the services PMI picked up to 50.6 in January from 49.8 in December. A number of services companies – which cover retailers and hotels to banks – reported waning confidence following the Paris terrorist attack in November. Insee, France’s statistics body, recently halved its estimate of fourth quarter GDP growth to 0.2 per cent, partly owing to the impact of the attacks. Economists had expected the services PMI to reach 50.1 in January.The composite PMI – which combines services and manufacturing readings – edged up to 50.5 from 50.1 in December. Today’s results are preliminary or “flash” readings.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit said:January’s French PMI figures signalled an uneventful start to the year, with the private sector economy eking out marginal activity growth, shrugging off the recent volatility in financial markets. Competitive pressures remain strong, with firms cutting their selling prices at the sharpest rate in seven months in a bid to shore up demand, suggesting that inflation is set to remain very weak in the near future. A slight rise in employment – the first since mid-2015 – offers mild reassurance on the labour market front, although does little to suggest a meaningful improvement in the jobless rate is on the cards from its current 18-year high of 10.6%.Moody’s Analytics believes the French economy will fare slightly better this year than last, predicting real GDP will grow by 1.6 per cent in 2016 compared to an estimate of 1.1 per cent growth for 2015. However, growth will be largely driven by consumption and private investment and France’s unemployment rate will remain high until “at least the end of the year”, according to Moody’s.

In April 2015, the bond was priced as high as 111 cents, writes Joel Lewin.S&P said Casino’s performance has been “weak, in the context of the group’s very high leverage”.This comes less than a month after US short seller Muddy Waters said Casino is one of the “most overvalued and misunderstood” companies it had ever come across.The cost of insuring Casino bonds against default has rocketed today, as the French company’s 5-year credit default swap spread has leapt 114 basis points to 540bps. In July it was trading as low as 102bps.Casino’s 540bps CDS spread implies a credit rating of B, deep in junk territory, according to a Markit analysis of CDS spreads across a range of sectors and credit ratings.More on Casino’s woes from the FT’s Nathalie Thomas here.The above charts are courtesy of Bloomberg

Financial services also performed poorly.The premium to insure the debt of investment-grade companies rose as well. The spread on the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade index climbed 5.7 basis points to 109.3.Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s warned earlier this week that corporate credit conditions are deteriorating at the quickest pace since 2009, largely due to weakness in the commodity-exposed energy and materials sectors.
263;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-15T14:23:04Z;Short sellers swoop on limping miners;;It’s been a bumpy start to the year for global equities, but none more so than miners. Commodity prices have started the year where they left off in 2015, sliding quickly, and taking mining stocks with them. Unsurprisingly, miners have been attracting the attention of short-sellers.The proportion of Anglo American shares on loan has rocketed to an all-time high of 9.6 per cent from less than 1 per cent last February, according to Markit data. (Short sellers bet a stock is going to fall by borrowing the shares, selling them, then buying them back and returning them to book a profit), writes Joel Lewin.In the last four months, short selling of Glencore shares has also risen from 1.5 per cent in September to 6 per cent today, Markit data show.Anglo has been taking the lead today as mining stocks continue their journey south. The shares have dropped 11.4 per cent, taking Anglo’s losses for the year so far to 22 per cent, after it fell 75 per cent in 2015. The company has lost more than 92 per cent of its market cap since 2011. But short sellers are clearly betting there’s still some juice left.Glencore is also taking a beating, down 8.3 per cent today, while BHP Billiton is down 6.9 per cent, Rio Tinto is falling 5.5 per cent and Antofagasta is losing 5.3 per cent.Familiar fears have resurfaced to drive commodity prices lower – namely those surrounding China’s economic slowdown, further fuelled by some questionable export data and poor manufacturing data, China’s stock market ructions and renminbi devaluation, emerging market growth concerns and oversupply.Traders in US commodity futures are currently holding a net short position ten times larger than in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, according to Barclays analysts, who add, “recent price declines for major commodities are now greater than in any crisis of the past 30 years.”Not pretty.Chart courtesy of Barclays.

The yield leapt 14bps yesterday and 54 bps last week, writes Joel Lewin.Unsurprisingly, the cost of insuring Glencore debt against default is rising. More surprising is the extent of this rise.The spread of the 5-year senior credit default swap (contracts that offer protection against a bond defaulting) has surged more than 150bps since the start of 2016 to an all-time high of 959bps. As recently as July it was trading at 168bps.That level implies a credit rating of CCC, according to Neil Mehta at Markit. That’s deep in junk territory.Both charts courtesy of Bloomberg.
265;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-08T07:08:23Z;German industrial production stages surprise fall;;Germany’s powerful industrial sector had a far weaker than expected November, as monthly production dropped 0.3 per cent compared to growth of 0.5 cent in October.The result was far worse than the 0.5 per cent growth that had been anticipated by economists. Year on year, production rose 0.1 per cent although this was still weaker than the 0.4 per cent rise recorded in October ( a figure that was on Friday revised upwards from an earlier estimate of no year on year growth for October).The negative industrial data – which are admittedly prone to volatility – break up a relatively decent run of economic numbers out of Germany and eurozone as a whole recently.While concerns over the outlook for the global economy are growing, as fears mount that a slowdown in China could be steeper than anticipated, European data – until now – has remained relatively solid.Figures published yesterday showed Germany factory orders jumped 1.5 per cent month on month in November, well ahead of a 0.1 per cent growth forecast.Recent survey data for the eurozone suggest the common currency area ended 2015 on a solid enough footing, with research group Markit anticipating 0.4 per cent GDP growth for the fourth quarter as a whole.
266;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-07T12:57:03Z;Saudi stocks, riyal face testing start to 2016;;Saudi Arabia’s stock market has continued its difficult start to the year, with the country’s benchmark index falling another 4.8 per cent on Thursday to a four-year low.Chart: BloombergThe move extends its drop this year to 10.6 per cent, and leaves it 44 per cent weaker than its post financial crisis peak in 2014, writes Joel Lewin.Oil prices have slumped to an 11-year low and Saudi relations with Iran are rapidly deteriorating after the kingdom executed a prominent Shiite cleric. The escalation of tensions between the two didn’t even help lift oil prices, as some had predicted. Instead prices continued to decline, with analysts predicting the fractured relationship between the two diminishes hopes of Opec agreeing a production cut.The cost of insuring Saudi bonds against default has jumped. The spread of Saudi Arabia’s 5-year senior dollar credit default swap – a contract that insures against the risk of a bond defaulting- climbed 16 basis points today to 194bps, Markit data show. A year ago it stood at just 73 bps.Simon Colvin at Markit said:It’s been trying to expand its tax base and cut spending, but it has a lot of big spending commitments and it’s still running a large deficit- almost $100bn last year. The current oil price is way below what it needs to break even.In the rising CDS spread, you’re seeing the market ask to be compensated a lot more to insure Saudi bonds against default in light of the greater risks.And although the kingdom is sticking with its dollar peg, bets against the riyal are building. The 12 month forward rate has rocketed in the last six months. The divergence between the dollar/riyal spot rate and the 12 month forward rate hasn’t been so wide in at least four years. There’s more about the pressures on the riyal peg from the FT’s Katie Martin here.Chart: Bloomberg(Top image: Getty)
267;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T10:20:33Z;Eurozone factory gate prices fall for 28th month;;Eurozone producer prices contracted for the 28th consecutive month in November, as the region’s economic recovery fails to gather sufficient strength to allow producers to raise prices.Factory gate prices fell 0.2 per cent in November from the previous month, or 3.2 per cent from the same time last year.An earlier reading for showing prices contracted 3.1 per cent in October was revised even lower to 3.2 per cent, meaning the rate of contraction remained steady.Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics says:GDP growth is still too slow to provide a meaningful boost to core inflation. Underlying price pressures in the eurozone remain very weak.Today’s producer prices data point to continued weak pipeline inflationary pressure, with November’s 3.2% annual fall in producer prices consistent with a renewed downturn in non-energy consumer goods inflation.(Chart courtesy of Bloomberg)Prices have been contracting since mid-2013. The economic slowdown in China has worried manufacturers in Europe, and particularly in Germany, which exports a lot of high value machinery.Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:November’s further drop in producer prices highlights the risk that Eurozone consumer price inflation could remain lower for longer due to the weakness in oil and commodity prices.It is clearly going to be a long and arduous slog for Eurozone consumer price inflation to get up near the ECB’s target rate of “close to, but just below 2.0”. Indeed, it currently looks unlikely to happen until 2018, and the ECB is seriously concerned about the downside risks that could further delay the inflation target being achieved.However, Purchasing Managers Indices published by Markit this week show the manufacturing sector’s recovery is gaining traction. Every country clocked in with output growth and job creation, and there were particularly positive surprises from Germany, Italy and Greece.(Chart courtesy of Bloomberg)
268;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T09:33:58Z;UK services PMI disappointing but ‘steady’;;The UK economy is likely to have expanded by a solid but “unexciting” 0.5 per cent in the final three months of last year after growth in the country’s dominant services sector dipped slightly in December, according to the research group that compiles the purchasing managers’ index surveys of activity.The closely-watched services PMI dropped to 55.5 last month from 55.9 in November, although the sector is still safely in growth territory. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.Economists polled by Bloomberg had, however, expected a better reading of 55.6 for December.Chancellor George Osborne suffered a bit of a blow just before Christmas when growth for the third quarter of 2015 was revised down to 0.4 per cent from earlier estimates of 0.5 per cent.The UK manufacturing PMI, published earlier this week, also disappointed dropping to 51.9 in December from 52.5, although the construction industry ended the year on a better note.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:The surveys point to the economy having grown 0.5% in the fourth quarter, a solid but perhaps unexciting pace that means GDP would have risen 2.2% in 2015.A rosy outlook is by no means assured, however. With business expectations about future workloads dropping to the lowest for almost three years, firms are becoming more cautious in the face of growing uncertainties. The cost impact of the Living Wage, government spending cuts, a potential hike in interest rates, global economic growth jitters and of course ‘Brexit’ are all weighing on business minds and pose significant downside risks to economic growth in 2016.
269;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T09:10:51Z;Eurozone economy ended 2015 ‘on solid footing’;;The eurozone economy as a whole ended 2015 on a positive note, final readings of the closely-watched purchasing managers’ index surveys suggest.A final reading for the eurozone’s services sector was revised up to 54.2 (well above the 50 reading that divides contraction and growth) from an earlier estimate of 53.9. That means the sector held its nerve month on month as December’s final reading matched November’s result of 54.2.The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services sector surveys, was also revised to 54.3 from an initial estimate of 54. This marked a slight improvement on the 54.2 reading in November. The composite index has now indicated expansion for 30 successive months, Markit, which compiles the surveys, said.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said:The eurozone economy starts 2016 on a solid footing and well placed to enjoy a year of robust expansion. Growth of business activity continued to edge higher at the end of 2015, with an upturn in the PMI rounding off the strongest quarter for fourand-a-half years.But he added:However, despite the improvement, the survey data signal a modest 0.4% increase in GDP in the fourth quarter, which would mean the eurozone grew 1.5% in 2015. Given that we have seen almost a year’s worth of quantitative easing, there is a concern that policy is proving somewhat ineffectual.Services PMIs published today for individual countries across the eurozone were a bit of a mixed bag, showing varying fortunes across the common currency bloc. France’s services sector slipped into contraction territory, dropping to 49.8 for December, but there were good results from both Italy and Germany.Germany’s services sector outpaced expectations last month, according to Markit. The German services PMI rose to 56 from 55.4 in November, when economists had expected the reading to remain the same in December. Markit said its December survey suggested the strongest rise in service sector business activity for nearly one and a half years.Italy’s services sector also ended 2015 on a high as growth accelerated at the fastest pace in over five and a half years, marking another milestone in the country’s recovery. Italy finally returned to growth following a triple dip recession at the start of 2015.More from Markit here.
270;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T08:55:06Z;French services PMI drops to 11-month low;;France’s services sector went into reverse gear at the end of 2015, despite consumers trying to put on a brave face following the Paris terrorist attacks in November.A final reading of December’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for France’s services sector dropped to 49.8, below the crucial dividing line between growth and contraction and an eleven-month low. The December reading fell from 51 the previous month.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the France Services PMI, said:The French service sector broadly stagnated in December, ending a ten-month run of expanding activity. Anecdotal evidence suggested that a number of businesses continued to be affected by cancellations following the recent terrorist attacks, exerting a drag on new business growth. Correspondingly, business expectations dipped to the lowest level for over a year. Service providers responded by cutting their charges to the greatest extent in six months, which they will be hoping may spur new work intakes to get the New Year off to a more positive start.However, a survey of French consumer confidence from the country’s statistics office, published earlier, showed consumers are trying to remain resilient, despite concerns over security. An index of consumer confidence held steady at 96 for the third consecutive month in December.The PMI survey for France’s manufacturing sector, published on Monday, suggested growth slowed slightly in December. The French manufacturing PMI dipped to to 51.4 from 51.6 in November.
271;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T08:23:47Z;Slight dip in Spanish services PMI to end 2015;;It was a slightly disappointing end to the year for Spain’s services sector.The closely-watched purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for Spain’s services sector staged a surprise fall to 55.1 for December from 56.7 the previous month. Economists had expected a slight dip in the survey of activity to 56.6. One possible factor that could have led to caution were the Spanish elections on December 20, which left the country’s parliament deeply fragmented (read the latest on Spain’s political situation from the FT’s Tobias Buck here)However, any reading above 50 indicates growth, meaning Spanish services companies, with cover anything from hotels to banks, are still safely in positive territory.Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the PMI report said:The Spanish service sector ended 2015 with a sense of optimism, according to the latest PMI survey. The data, collected prior to the general election on December 20th, signalled a further sharp rise in business activity, and improved optimism that growth will be maintained during 2016.The services result pushed the composite PMI – which combines services and manufacturing – to 55.2 for December from 56.2.
272;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-06T05:08:15Z;India’s services sector bounces in December;;India’s services sector grew by the most in almost a year in December, a bright spot for an economy with a long list of problems.The Nikkei-sponsored purchasing managers’ index for the sector reported a reading of 53.6, the highest since February. It had been 50.1 in November.The overall composite PMI score for India in December was 51.6, compared to 50.2 in November. The 50-mark separates contraction from expansion.Prime minister Narendra Modi has put revitalising the Indian economy at the heart of his term in office. But the country is grappling with problems which have plagued it for decades: heavy red tape, poor infrastructure and dire levels of poverty which create skills gaps in some industries.Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit, said:Goods producers saw both order books and production dip for the first time in over two years.But she added:Overall, the PMI data continue to portray a struggling economy, weighed down by weak underlying demand. Indeed, cost inflation continues to surpass charge inflation, highlighting the intense competitive environment. Moreover, firms’ reluctance to hire was evident throughout 2015, with meaningful job creation last recorded in 2013. This suggests that conditions are likely to remain challenging in the near-term.
273;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-05T12:13:51Z;UK construction industry still seen as robust;Evidence from key survey continues to paint much more optimistic picture of than official data;The British construction industry ended the year on a robust note, according to survey evidence that continues to paint a far more optimistic picture of the sector than official data.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey rose to 57.3 in December, rebounding from a still-strong seven-month low of 55.3 in November. Readings in excess of 50 indicate that activity is increasing.Commercial construction remained the best-performing sub-category, with housing activity also increasing at solid rate, albeit slower than the highs seen in 2014. Hiring also bounced back, with subcontractor usage rising at its fastest pace since August 2014.David Nobel, Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS) chief executive, said that the outlook for this year looked strong.“The perfect conditions of lower commodity prices, helping bring cost inflation close to April’s six-year low, and a supportive UK economy have given the sector a solid foundation to build on with continued positive sentiment for the year ahead,” he said.The challenge for economists assessing the health of the sector is that the official data are painting a far bleaker picture. The latest estimate from the Office for National Statistics is that the industry contracted 1.9 per cent in the third quarter of the year.But because the construction survey data do not have national statistics status — a Kitemark for those data sources that “meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value” according to the UK Statistics Authority, which oversees the ONS — economists are treating the data with caution.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that it was a “largely decent, reassuring survey” from Markit.“There look to be pretty solid grounds to believe that the construction sector can achieve decent expansion over the coming months and contribute to GDP growth. The sector will also ultimately benefit from repair and replacement work resulting from the flood damage,” he added.In the immediate aftermath of the winter 2013-14 floods, UK civil engineering activity picked up at a survey-record pace, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, noted.Max Jones, construction director at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said that infrastructure in particular looked “well placed” for 2016, with a number of big flagship projects including the Thames Tideway tunnel and Hinkley Point nuclear power station set to break ground.“Feedback from clients suggests many are relatively sanguine about external headwinds. Many large contractors have little in the way of exposure outside the UK and therefore feel the potential of Brexit would not impact them either way,” he said.Just over half of the purchasing managers’ survey panel (51 per cent) anticipated a rise in business activity in 2016, with only 7 per cent expecting a fall.Respondents cited greater client budgets, improving economic conditions and a strong pipeline of projects as underpinning their confidence. The government’s commitment to new housebuilding is also expected to help the sector.
274;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-05T09:31:47Z;Positive end to 2015 for UK construction groups;;The UK construction sector ended 2015 on a far better note, following two months of dwindling growth, according to a closely-watched survey of activity.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the construction sector – compiled by research group Markit – jumped up to 57.8 in December from 55.3 the previous month. Economists had expected a reading of 56.The construction PMI topped 60 in February (any reading above 50 indicates growth) but staged a sharp fall in November to 55.3, a seven-month low. December’s reading was boosted by a strong performance by the commercial construction sector.Tim Moore, senior Economist at Markit, said:UK construction companies finished 2015 in a positive fashion, as overall output growth recovered from November’s seven-month low. Commercial building was the main engine of growth, with this area of activity expanding at the strongest pace since autumn 2014. There was also a rebound in house building activity in December, but momentum was still much softer than the post-crisis highs achieved during 2014.Things are looking up for the UK construction sector, particularly housebuilders, with the government deciding to turn into a housing developer. Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Monday that the government would directly commission the construction of homes on land owned by the taxpayer.The positive construction PMI comes after a disappointing outcome for the manufacturing sector. The UK manufacturing PMI – published on Monday – dropped to 51.9 in December from 52.5. Economists had been expecting a rise in the survey.
275;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-04T14:09:28Z;Economic rebalancing in UK remains elusive;Manufacturing activity weakens but consumers increase borrowing;The unbalanced nature of the UK economic recovery was laid bare on Monday as new data showed consumers hungry for credit while activity in the manufacturing sector weakened further.Buffeted by the strength of sterling and subdued demand in the eurozone, the Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers fell to 51.9 in December, its weakest level in three months, down from 52.5 the previous month.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey company Markit, said the sector was unlikely to contribute much to overall growth and activity was slowing “towards the stagnation mark”.In contrast, fresh figures from the Bank of England showed consumers borrowed an additional £1.5bn in November, the biggest monthly increase in unsecured borrowing since before the financial crisis.Mortgage approvals also rose to 70,410 in November, compared with an average of 68,428 over the past six months.The reliance on consumers to drive growth was a key concern of leading economists in the FT’s annual survey, published on Sunday.John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said: “Five years ago ‘economic growth and rebalancing’ tripped off the rhetorical tongue like ‘love and marriage’. Rebalancing has since slipped down the agenda despite there being little improvement.”[The Imbalance] will return to haunt us when interest rates inevitably rise and we need genuine investment and export-led growth to offset a slowdown in consumer spendingHe argued the underlying problem “will return to haunt us when interest rates inevitably rise and we need genuine investment and export- led growth to offset a slowdown in consumer spending”.Andrew Smith, chief economic adviser to the Industry Forum, said export and investment-led growth “has been the holy grail of UK policymakers for as long as I can remember. I suspect it will stay out of reach and this recovery, like others, will remain consumer-led”.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed household spending rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent — more than average pay increases.This has pushed down the proportion of income that households saved to 4.4 per cent, matching the first quarter’s record low. Real incomes continue to grow, as wages are still rising faster than prices.With the annual rate of increase in consumer credit now above 8 per cent, Martin Beck, senior economist adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, warned it was “reminiscent of the credit-fuelled era of the mid-2000s.”Any further acceleration “may well make 2016 the year when the Financial Policy Committee really makes its presence felt,” Mr Beck added.The Bank of England body, charged with ensuring financial stability, has the power to intervene if it feels credit growth is getting out of control, for example by imposing stricter affordability criteria on mortgages.Despite widespread political desire to support manufacturing , there are few signs of immediate relief.John Llewellyn, of Llewellyn Consulting, said that even if sterling was to fall “the positive consequences for the external balance would probably take two years to become manifest”.The drop in the latest PMI survey cancels out last October’s unexpected bounce and means the sector has resumed the fairly consistent downward trend of last year. A reading below 50 would indicate activity was decreasing.Some notable voices warn however against too much emphasis on the imbalance.Andrew Sentance, a former MPC member and now senior economic adviser to professional services firm PwC, said he “always thought it was unrealistic to expect a march of the makers” in terms of traditional manufacturing activities, such as steel production.“The UK is and remains a successful producer of high value-added manufacturing products. But it is in services that we have our biggest comparative advantage.”Exports from the UK’s dominant sector have long been in surplus, in sharp contrast to the persistent trade deficit in goods.
276;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-04T09:23:49Z;Eurozone manufacturing recovery gathers pace;;The eurozone manufacturing sector continued its recovery right up to the end of the year, with every country clocking in with output growth and job creation in December. (Yes, even Greece. More on that shortly.)Markit’s eurozone manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) nudged up to 53.2 in December from 53.1 in the previous month. That’s its best month since April 2014.Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while anything below 50 indicates contraction.Switzerland joined the party too. (Chart courtesy of Bloomberg.)Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit said:The end of 2015 saw the eurozone manufacturing recovery gain further traction, with rates of expansion in production and new orders over the final quarter besting those of quarter three. The sector is therefore likely to make a meaningful positive contribution to the euro GDP numbers for quarter four. Survey data also indicate that manufacturing growth over 2015 as a whole averaged above those achieved in each of the previous three years.Italy remained the leading light in December, while accelerated growth in Germany and France added welcome buoyancy to the region’s manufacturing performance. Solid job creation in the sector should also help chip away at the sustained high levels of unemployment still being experienced by some nations.While there is much to be positive about in these figures, the underlying picture is still one of solid yet unspectacular expansion. With eurozone manufacturing still some 9% off its pre-crisis peak, it looks as if the sector still has some distance to travel before the climb back to full recovery is completed.There were positive surprises almost across the board this morning, with exceptions for France and Spain.Germany’s manufacturing PMI came in at 53.2, ahead of economists’ forecasts of 53.Italy hit 55.6, compared with economists forecast of an unchanged reading of 54.9. That’s its highest reading since March 2011.Phil Smith at Markit said the Italian reading:completes what is a drastic turnaround from the situation just one year ago when the index was languishing below the 50.0 mark as the economy contracted. Since then, a weak euro, recovering domestic demand and falling global commodity prices have provided the necessary tailwinds to get things moving. The goods-producing sector has solid momentum heading into the New Year, with new order growth accelerating and companies taking on new staff to cope with rising production requirements.Switzerland’s manufacturing PMI jumped to 52.1, up from 49.7 in November and well ahead of forecasts of 50.1However, France let the side down, recording a slight dip to 51.4 from 51.6.
277;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-04T09:03:36Z;Solid growth for Spanish manufacturing;;Spain’s manufacturing sector is putting in a solid performance, with the latest survey of around 400 companies showing extending the long-running series of acceleration.The purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit, posted a reading of 53 for the month, barely changed from 53.1 in November. Business conditions have strengthened for the last 25 months in a row. (Anything over 50 indicates expansion.)But there’s a ‘but’…Employment growth is only marginal. Markit’s Andrew Harker, who wrote the report, said:Companies were perhaps cautious about making decisions on hiring and investment ahead of the election on December 20th (the data were all collected prior to the election) and subsequent results.More from Markit here.
278;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2016-01-04T05:09:11Z;Indian manufacturing contracts for first time since 2013;;Make in India? Maybe not.Prime minister Narendra Modi’s slogan for revitalising the country’s manufacturing sector has been undermined by the latest Nikkei-Markit purchasing managers index, which came in at 49.1 in December – marking the first time the sector has contracted since October 2013.It had been 50.3 in November. A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, and the November result was the 25th month in a row above that expansionary threshold.So what went wrong? The climate and the rupee. Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit, says:India’s manufacturing sector took a turn for the worse at the year end, with already-gloomy internal demand further hampered by floods in the South of the country. Ending a 25-month sequence of growth, production plummeted in December. Such was the extent of the decline that the rate of reduction was the sharpest since the financial crisis.The continued depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar pushed inflation higher, with PMI price indicators pointing to stronger increases in both input prices and output charges. Following the Fed rate hike and expectations of further increases, more currency weakness is anticipated, adding strain to businesses’ dollar-priced debt and import costs.

The rate was “fixed” 0.2 per cent weaker at Rmb6.5032 per dollar this morning, the first time it has been allowed to depreciate beyond Rmb6.50 since May 24, 2011.There was more disappointing data out on China’s manufacturing sector, with the privately-produced Caixin/Markit survey showing activity contracted in December. The index slipped to 48.2 last month, from 48.6 in November, and was weaker than economists expected.The news was carving a chunk out of regional markets. China’s Shanghai Composite was down 3.1 per cent within the first hour of trade, while the tech-focused Shenzhen Composite was down 4.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 2.1 per cent.It was the 10th month in a row that China’s manufacturing sector has remained in contractionary territory, according to the Caixin/Markit survey. Official PMI data from China’s national bureau of statistics, released on Friday, showed activity remained in contraction for a fifth straight month in December.Economists at ANZ remained hopeful that other parts of China’s economy may be able to offset weakness in the manufacturing sector and prop up overall growth.“As the PMI has remained below 50 in Q4 2015, GDP growth in Q4 is unlikely to have improved from Q3. Weak manufacturing will likely have weighed on growth. However, as observed in Q2 and Q3, the strong performance of the services industry, especially in the financial sector, may have offset some of the weakness from manufacturing,” ANZ noted.Declines for Japan’s Nikkei blew out in mid-morning trade, leaving the benchmark down 2.6 per cent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 reversed early gains to be down 0.3 per cent by lunchtime in Sydney.Korea’s Kospi was down 1.6 per cent. Separately, a Nikkei/Markit PMI survey showed the country’s manufacturing sector expanded in December, with the index rising to 50.7 last month from 49.1 in November.US and European markets ended 2015 on a down note, with US benchmarks dropping by about 1 per cent and leaving the S&P 500 with its first yearly decline since 2008.Asian currency markets were rattled by the PBoC’s move, which saw the renminbi weaken by 0.2 per cent. The New Zealand dollar was worst off, down 1.8 per cent at $0.6757, followed by the Australian dollar, down 1.2 per cent at $0.7215.Japan’s yen was the standout performer, 0.7 per cent stronger to Y119.69 per dollar, its strongest level since mid-October, as investors shifted toward perceived haven assets.The Singapore dollar was also performing poorly, 0.8 per cent weaker at S$1.4241 per dollar despite data showing the economy grew by a bigger-than-expected 5.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the three months to December 31.Meanwhile, the State Bank of Vietnam said at the weekend it was shifting to a more market-based approach in setting its currency’s value against the US dollar. The central bank lowered the dong’s fixing by 0.03 per cent to 21,896 per dollar this morning, the first time since August the rate has been lowered.Commodity markets were starting 2016 on the front foot. Oil prices were higher in Asia following escalating tensions at the weekend between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 1.8 per cent at $37.95 a barrel, but had been up by as much as 3.3 per cent in early trade. West Texas Intermediate was 1.3 per cent higher at $37.51.

Economists were looking for a reading of 48.9.That still leaves it below the threshold of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. Only in February did China’s manufacturing sector expand last year, according to the Caixin/Markit surveyThe slippage comes after two months of improvement in October and November. The survey hasn’t seen more than three consecutive increases since July 2014.He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group said:This shows that the forces driving an economic recovery have encountered obstacles and the economy is facing a greater risk of weakening. More fluctuations in global markets are expected now that the US Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. The government needs to pay more attention to external risk factors in the short term and fine-tune macroeconomic policies accordingly so the economy does not fall off a cliff. It needs to simultaneously push forward the supply-side reform to release its potential and reap the benefits.Data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics at the start of this month showed the official manufacturing PMI creeping slightly higher to 49.7, but remaining in contractionary territory for a fifth-straight month.The Caixin-sponsored series is based on a much smaller sample of private companies and tends to be more volatile than the official reading.

But not everyone seems convinced.Between the end of September and December 14, the yield on Anglo’s 2016 bond rocketed from 0.89 per cent to 8.26 per cent, writes Joel Lewin.Moody’s and Fitch had both downgraded the miner to the lowest investment grade rating, with Fitch warning:The challenges AA is facing are worse than we had previously forecast.But since then, the yield on the 2016 bond has dropped more than 2 percentage points to 6.02 per cent.After China unveiled plans for more stimulus this week, which could stoke demand for commodities, base metal prices have been nudging up from post-crisis lows.Anglo shares have climbed more than 21 per cent over the last four sessions, and are up 9 per cent today.But not everyone seems so sure this recovery has legs.Despite the sharp bounce in the miner’s share price, bets that the shares will fall further have continued to build.Short selling of the company’s shares has kept rising, with the percentage of shares on loan climbing to 8.1 per cent this week, up from 6.4 per cent two weeks ago, and more than quadruple the 1.97 per cent on loan in July, show Markit data.The cost of insuring Anglo American bonds against default has also continued to surge.The price of the 5-year senior credit default swap, a contract that offers insurance against the risk of the bonds defaulting- has risen to an all-time high of 1,015 basis points today, up from less than 200bps in July.

It got off to a good start in the first quarter, growing 0.7 per cent but then stagnated in the second quarter.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, expects the economy to expand at a similar pace in the final three months of the year as the third quarter.
283;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Junk bonds: from rout to rally;;The Fed hike came, and went, and junk bonds are still standing. Even better than that, they’re climbing and attracting inflows again, allaying fears that a rate rise would intensify the recent sell-off that has hammered the asset class and forced several funds to close.High yield bonds have been making gains throughout the week, with yields falling sharply in both the US and Europe. Today they have continued apace, unfazed by yesterday’s first Fed rate rise in almost a decade. How about that for a change of heart:It’s only a tentative turnaround, and yields are still well above where they were just a month ago, but at least they’ve stopped rising.This week’s rally comes after a rough few months for junk bonds, when yields rocketed and several funds were forced to close or freeze redemptions as the sell-off accelerated, with tumbling oil and commodity prices contributing to the rout, particularly in the US, writes Joel Lewin.Today Blackrock’s US high yield ETF has climbed 1.7 per cent. Over the last three days it has gained 4.6 per cent, almost entirely recovering its December losses.The euro equivalent has risen 0.6 per cent, taking its gains over the last three days to 1.6 per cent. The rally comes after ten straight sessions of losses.The abrupt shift in sentiment has been reflected in ETF flows, with global high yield funds attracting inflows yesterday for the first time in seven sessions, show Markit data.In spite of the Fed meeting yesterday, junk bond ETFs lured $744m, their largest one day inflow in more than two months, after losing $3.1bn during the previous six sessions.Meawhile, the cost of insuring high yield bonds against default has continued to decline today.Markit’s iTraxx Europe Crossover Index, which tracks credit default swaps that offer protection against the risk of junk bonds defaulting, has dropped another 10 basis points today to 318bps.It has dropped 40bps in the last three days, indicating a chunky drop in the price of insuring bonds that indicates a significant shift in sentiment.
284;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-16T12:06:33Z;Eurozone recovery bolstered by strongest PMI reading since crisis;Quarterly results indicate firmest expansion in more than four years with inflation subdued;The euro area’s recovery remains on track, with a closely watched measure of the single currency area’s economic performance registering its strongest quarterly reading since the region’s crisis took hold.A flash reading for the influential purchasing managers’ index for the region, compiled by data company Markit, edged down this month, from 54.2 in November to 54. But the three most recent readings have been the strongest on average for four and-a-half years and were all well above the crucial 50 level that indicates an expansion in economic activity.Separately, a final reading for inflation in the region was slightly stronger than an earlier estimate, showing prices rose by 0.2 per cent in the year to November.Manufacturing activity rose at its fastest pace for more than a year and-a-half, according to the PMI, signalling a weaker single currency is benefiting the region’s exporters.The reading indicated the region’s solid, if unspectacular, recovery was set to continue into the new year.Employment growth was the highest since May 2011, before the single currency area faced the worst economic and financial crisis of its history. Backlogs of work were also at their highest since the spring of 2011, suggesting companies will raise staffing levels in the months ahead to cater for stronger demand. That will help a region which continues to battle with double-digit unemployment, especially in more vulnerable parts of its periphery.A separate reading for the eurozone’s largest economy, Germany, edged down slightly from 55.2 to 54.9 but signalled rates of job creation remain strong. Activity in France, the region’s second-largest economy, slowed from 51 in November to 50.3, although a separate reading for manufacturing was the strongest for more than one and-a-half years.“Although the PMI edged lower in December, the fourth quarter as a whole saw the largest increase in business activity for four and-a-half years,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “The survey is signalling a quarterly GDP rise of 0.4 per cent, meaning the region grew 1.5 per cent in 2015.”Mr Williamson added: “The upturn in hiring also indicates that companies are optimistic about prospects for the year ahead and suggests that the pace of GDP growth could lift higher in coming months.”Earlier this month, the single currency area’s policymakers fired another round of stimulus into the economy in the hope of bolstering a recovery that remains vulnerable to weaker growth beyond its borders.Policymakers at the European Central Bank extended their quantitative easing programme by six months to March 2017, taking the total size of the programme to €1.46tn, and cut a key interest rate to a fresh record low of minus 0.3 per cent.While inflation in the region is marginally better than expected, it remains well below the ECB’s target of just under 2 per cent. Core inflation, a measure which strips out more volatile price changes for food and energy goods, was 0.9 per cent.
285;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-16T09:07:46Z;Eurozone enjoys strongest quarter for 4.5 years – Markit;;Manufacturers in the eurozone are enjoying a solid end to 2015, with a well respected survey of activity in the sector jumping to a 20-month high for December.A preliminary reading of the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for December rose to 53.1 from 52.8 in November and well ahead of expectations. The result represents a 20-month high in the index, which is compiled by research group Markit.Services companies in the common currency area did not have such a great end to the year – the services PMI dipped to 53.9 from 54.2 in November, underperforming expectations – but Markit said the surveys show the eurozone economy still enjoyed its strongest quarter for four and a half years.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said:The eurozone economy enjoyed a comfortably solid end to 2015, though policymakers are likely to remain disappointed by the relatively modest pace of expansion and lack of inflationary pressures, given the stage of the recovery and the amount of stimulus already in place.Although the PMI edged lower in December, the fourth quarter as a whole saw the largest increase in business activity for four-and-a-half years. The survey is signalling a quarterly GDP rise of 0.4%, meaning the region grew 1.5% in 2015.Most encouraging of all is the upturn in the rate of job creation to the highest since spring 2011, which will hopefully pave the way for unemployment to start falling in earnest as we move into 2016. The upturn in hiring also indicates that companies are optimistic about prospects for the year ahead and suggests that the pace of GDP growth could lift higher in coming months.The survey data suggest GDP growth picked up in Germany during the fourth quarter, rising to 0.5% as strong domestic demand and increasing exports drove a broad-based upturn in manufacturing and services. It’s a different story in France, however, where the survey points to a mere 0.2% GDP rise at best in the fourth quarter, and a further slowing to near-stagnation in December bodes ill for the coming year – especially in the stalling service sector.
286;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-16T08:41:49Z;German businesses put in best quarterly performance in 1.5 years – Markit;;There is a theme emerging here. Germany’s manufacturing sector outperformed expectations in December, according to a closely-watched survey of activity, but the country’s services sector is having a tougher than expected time of it, mirroring a trend in the French private sector.The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a survey of activity by research group Markit – for Germany’s manufacturing sector for December improved to 53 from 52.9 the previous month, according to an initial or “flash” estimate. Economists had been expecting the manufacturing PMI to dip to 52.8.However the services PMI edged back to 55.4 from 55.6 in November. Although economists had been expecting a dip, they had forecast a higher reading of 55.5.Even so, both readings are safely in expansion territory. Markit said Germany is still looking at its best quarterly performance in one and a half years.Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, said:Germany’s private sector companies ended the fourth quarter on a solid footing, with all key barometers of corporate health showing further improvements. While output and new orders increased at slightly weaker rates, growth remained above their respective longterm trends.The labour market was a particularly bright spot, according to December’s flash PMI results. The rate of jobs growth reached a four-year high, highlighting greater confidence about upcoming workloads. Moreover, the impressive improvement in employment has been fuelled by one of the most marked expansions in new business since 2011.That said, higher employment levels were unable to alleviate pressure on capacity, as backlogs of work continued to rise strongly.The average Composite Output Index reading for the fourth quarter as a whole is the best in one-and-a-half years. The data therefore point to an acceleration of GDP growth from the 0.3% seen in the third quarter.
287;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Economists had expected the reading for the “flash” PMI to remain at 50.6. A final reading for the survey will be published later this month.However, a similar survey for the services sector fell well short of expectations. The services flash PMI slipped to 50 – the crucial number that divides expansion and contraction – from 51 in November and short of forecasts for a reading of 50.8.This pushed the composite PMI – which combines services and manufacturing – to 50.3 from 51 previously, very close to stagnation territory.Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys said:“French private sector output growth nearly ground to a halt at the end of 2015 amid faltering new business intakes. A slowdown in the dominant service sector was the driver, with some panellists indicating that their new business intakes had been impacted following the recent terrorist attacks.The manufacturing sector picked up momentum, however, bolstered by the sharpest rise in new orders since early-2014. PMI data for the fourth quarter as a whole suggest that GDP growth is likely to have remained at a similar moderate pace to the 0.3% rise seen in the previous quarter.

Most economists predict rates will begin to rise next year.The retail price index — no longer rated as a national statistic but still used to uprate a wide range of investments — rose to 1.1 per cent in November from 0.7 per cent the previous month.But in a reminder that not all living costs are stable, separate ONS data showed that UK house prices rose 7 per cent in the year to October from 6.1 per cent the previous month.

Expectations that it will gain approval have risen after the EU recently approved a similar scheme by German group RWE in Lynemouthe.Drax shares have fallen more than 74 per cent in the last two years, as low gas prices have weighed and the UK government has rocked the country’s renewable energy industry by slashing subsidies.But today Goldman Sachs gave Drax a double upgrade from Sell to Buy. Goldman said:We believe the risk/reward for Drax is skewed to the upside following material underperformance, which we believe was due to declining gas and power prices in the UK, and as a result we upgrade to Buy from Sell.The key question for Drax is the European Commission (EC)’s decisionDrax shares have been heavily shorted over the last few years, as investors have placed bets that the shares will keep falling. However, a large number of those bets have been closed over the last few weeks as the outlook for Drax has got brighter.Currently 9.65 per cent of Drax’s shares have been borrowed (a proxy for short selling), down from 10.88 per cent at the end of November, according to Markit data. But that is still well above the FTSE 100 average of 1.9 per cent, and the 0.27 per cent of Drax shares on loan less than two years ago.Chart courtesy of Markit.
291;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-11T19:59:37Z;Anglo American: a good week for short sellers;;"Anglo American shares plunged 22.1 per cent this week to a new record low, the worst weekly drop in the miner’s history. While shareholders have suffered, short sellers should have prospered.By almost every measure it’s been an exacting week for the world’s largest platinum miner, writes Joel Lewin.On Friday, Anglo’s credit rating was downgraded to the lowest rung that’s still investment grade by Fitch. On Thursday, Moody’s did the same. On Tuesday, the miner scrapped for at least two years. But for the burgeoning number of Anglo American short sellers, it’s been a brighter week.The proportion of Anglo American shares on loan climbed to 6.5 per cent this week, up from 5.9 per cent last week and just 1.97 per cent in July, according to data provider Markit. The amount of shares on loan is seen as a proxy for short selling, in which an investor borrows the shares, sells them and – assuming their bet on future declines is correct – buys them back to book a profit.Anglo’s rising share of short-sellers also underscores how rapidly sentiment towards the Johannesburg-based company has deteriorated. The average proportion of shares on loan for FTSE 100 companies is 1.9 per cent, according to Markit.The bets against Anglo will have paid off. The stock is down 77 per cent in the last 10 months, with its market value falling to £4.11bn from £17.9bn.Anglo’s fellow FTSE 100 miner, Glencore has also a rise in the short selling of its shares. The proportion of Glencore shares on loan has jumped 3.8 percentage points to 5.3 per cent in the last two-and-a-half months.Simon Colvin at Markit said:It shows that people are positioning for a continuation of the recent slide. Their [Anglo and Glencore] shares are both down over 70% for the year yet the demand to borrow has never been so strong.Whatever happens to Anglo’s share price, analysts at Moody’s reckons:Industry performance will remain under pressure [next year]; we expect earnings contraction to continue in 2016 after a material compression in 2015. China’s slowdown and continued weakness in other global economies will maintain downward price pressure. Mine development will be more expensive, take longer and face more environmental and political issues."

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Friday that a “meltdown” in the market has only just started.Mr Icahn said in an interview with CNBC that “the high-yield market is just a keg of dynamite that sooner or later will blow up.”The tumbling oil price has already applied pressure to the riskier corners of the corporate bond market, in part because energy companies borrowed heavily in good times to invest in production.Sentiment was also hit on Friday after Third Avenue, a US asset manager, announced on Thursday it would close a $788m “Focused Credit Fund” following losses.The fund is modest in size and some in the industry were quick to point out that the fund’s problems may be idiosyncratic ones.But in a sign of the stress, the cost to insure high-yield debt jumped on Friday. A Markit index tracking the cost to insure the debt of North American high-yield bonds jumped by 41.8 basis points in midday trading to 5.18 per cent. The spread, a measure of the premium paid by the buyer of the insurance, is at the highest level in three years, according to Bloomberg data.
293;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-04T21:28:37Z;Europe drops antitrust probe into banks’ CDS market activities;Brussels cites ‘lack of evidence’ as investigation into 13 institutions ends;A four-year investigation by Europe’s antitrust authorities into allegations of collusion in the credit insurance market has suffered a major blow after clearing 13 of the world’s largest investment banks, citing “a lack of evidence”.Brussels had spent four years trying to build a case that the investment banks — including Citigroup, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan — had illegally shut out exchanges from creating rival trading platforms in the credit default swaps (CDS) market.Investigators had filed a charge sheet running to 400 pages alleging the banks colluded to ensure the insurance-like contracts remained a lucrative “over-the-counter” (OTC) product where the banks would remain indispensable, and competition from CME Group and Deutsche Börse, two of the world’s largest futures exchanges, was muscled out.They also alleged that Markit, which provides financial information to the market, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, may have also played a role.However, the commission said on Friday that “the evidence was not sufficiently conclusive to confirm the commission’s concerns with regards to the 13 investment banks”.It added it would “continue monitoring the practices of investment banks in financial markets”, in a decision quietly announced at the bottom of a daily circular press briefing.However, the commission said it was still investigating Markit and Isda. In response, Isda said it “believes it has acted properly at all times. We will continue to co-operate with regulatory authorities to resolve this matter.” Markit said it “believes it has acted properly and will continue to co-operate fully with the European Commission”.The decision comes only two months after some of Wall Street’s biggest banks agreed to a $1.87bn settlement in the US to resolve investors’ allegations that they clubbed together to inflate prices and keep new entrants out of the market.EU investigators had homed in on the market as policymakers repeatedly blamed the lack of transparency in the derivatives markets for exacerbating the global financial crisis, as well as speculation in credit default swaps for worsening the eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2011. CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness.However, the CDS market has fallen out of favour with investors since the financial crisis. The market’s gross notional outstanding — a broad measure of all outstanding derivatives positions — is currently about $14tn, approximately two-thirds of its size at its peak. Attempts by Intercontinental Exchange — a US exchanges operator that was named within the scope of the initial investigation because it runs a credit swaps clearing house — to turn the market into an exchange-traded market have also foundered. The investigation into ICE was informally dropped several years ago.The 13 banks were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bear Stearns, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.
294;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-12-01T13:06:55Z;Flagging global trade curbs UK manufacturing growth;PMI survey shows ‘lacklustre’ activity at SMEs;After a surprise jump in October, activity in the UK’s manufacturing sector fell in November.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers dropped to 52.7, reversing most of the gains that saw the index hit a 16-month high of 55.2 in October. Despite the decline, it still remains above the 50 mark that indicates increasing activity.But Markit said the positive signs were mainly confined to large organisations, with activity at small and medium companies “lacklustre” in comparison. Staffing levels also remained stagnant across the whole industry, indicating retrenchment.Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said the subdued picture echoed what she was hearing from firms, with “flagging world trade growth and the low oil price dragging on some sectors being partly compensated with brighter demand prospects from consumers”.Manufacturing has struggled to recover from the recession, with output still remaining about 4 per cent below its pre-recession peak. Domestic demand has proved one of the only bright spots, with exports hit by the weakness of the recovery in the eurozone as well as the strong pound.But there were hints of improvement, with the survey reporting that inflows of work from overseas clients had risen for the third straight month.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said while many weaknesses remained there were signs that the sector was moving back towards expansion. “Although the pace of growth so far is only very modest, it positions manufacturing as less of a drag on the broader economy,” he said.Official statistics show manufacturing output has fallen quarter on quarter in each of the first three quarters this year.Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, said long-term under-investment in infrastructure also remained a problem, adding the “long-term winds blowing against UK manufacturing are likely to stall any meaningful growth”.Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC, said last month’s jump in the PMIs did “look a bit too good to last”.She added that in terms of overall economic growth, Thursday’s PMI reading for services — which accounts for 75 per cent of GDP — was far more important.In a further sign that domestic inflationary pressure remained subdued, input costs and factory gate selling prices fell again in November. Inflation is about zero, but the Bank of England expected this to improve in the spring when the impact of last year’s drop in oil prices fell out of the calculation.
295;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-11-23T13:35:17Z;Eurozone economic activity peaks at four-year high;Purchasing managers’ index hit 54.4 this month, comfortably above 50 mark which indicates expansion;Business activity in the eurozone grew at its fastest pace in four-and-a-half years, although companies continue to cut prices, fuelling expectations that the European Central Bank will bulk up its monetary stimulus programme next month.According to a flash estimate by the data firm Markit, the eurozone purchasing managers’ index hit 54.4 this month, up from 53.9 in October, and comfortably above the 50 mark that indicates economic expansion. The PMI, a monthly survey of about 5,000 eurozone businesses, takes account of factors including new orders, employment and production.However, despite the better than expected figures, the survey found that eurozone companies continued to cut prices for goods and services, while input costs barely rose as global commodity prices continued to fall.The continuing deflationary pressures are likely to reinforce expectations that the ECB will unveil further monetary stimulus at its next meeting on December 3 — which takes place just weeks before a crucial Federal Reserve vote where US policymakers are expected to raise interest rates.Clemente de Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, said that there was “a significant amount of spare capacity in the economy” and the downward pressure on prices was likely to spur the ECB into action.“We continue to expect an extension of the asset purchase programme, an increase in monthly purchases and a cut in the deposit rate to be announced on December 3,” he said.ECB policymakers considered ramping up their support for the eurozone economy last month, but held off on signs that the currency area’s economy had proven relatively resilient in spite of faltering global growth.However, Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, last week gave his clearest indication yet that the ECB was gearing up for a further bout of monetary stimulus, saying at a conference in Frankfurt that policymakers would “do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible”.The stronger than expected business activity in the eurozone was powered by Germany, where growth accelerated to a three-month high, Markit said.Growth in the services sector was partially offset by a slowdown in Germany’s dominant manufacturing sector. However, both reported an increase in job creation.Last weekend’s tragic events in Paris . . . subdued economic activity in France — especially in the service sectorBy contrast, economic activity in France rose at its slowest rate for three months, reflecting the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris, which were carried out on November 13, the second of the nine days during which Markit collected its data.“Last weekend’s tragic events in Paris . . . subdued economic activity in France — especially in the service sector,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Despite the weakness in France, Mr Williamson said that the overall data suggested that the eurozone was “on course for one of its best quarterly performances over the past four-and-a-half years”.“The data are signalling GDP growth of 0.4 per cent in the closing quarter of the year, with 0.5 per cent in sight if we get even just a modest uptick in December,” he said.
296;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-11-04T10:28:52Z;UK service sector activity accelerates for first time in 4 months;Growth follows robust results for manufacturing and construction;Activity in the UK’s dominant service sector increased for the first time in four months in October, boosting hopes that the recent economic slowdown is only temporary.After robust results for manufacturing and construction this week, the Markit/CIPS survey of service purchasing managers rose to 54.9 from a two-year low of 53.3 in September. Readings in excess of 50 indicate activity is increasing.Sterling hit an 11-week high against the euro in response on the bet that the UK economy would again be one of the fastest-growing advanced economies.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the all-sector Purchasing Managers’ Index stood at 55.7, which on historic data would signal fourth-quarter GDP growth of 0.6 per cent, up from the slightly disappointing 0.5 per cent in the third quarter. Most City economists took a positive steer from the data.Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the surveys made “optimistic reading” in terms of the prospects for the UK economy. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments firm World First, said he was “more comfortable with seeing the recent downturn in UK economic data as a blip and not the beginning of anything more sustained or prolonged”.But the details of the survey offer something for both the hawks and doves on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, which is meeting on Wednesday ahead of the interest rate decision and release of the quarterly inflation report on Thursday.For those officials inching towards a rate rise, news that firms continued to create jobs at a brisk pace and report needing to pay higher salaries to attract the right staff will reinforce the belief that there is little remaining slack — or room for non-inflationary growth — in the labour market.But with input price inflation slowing to a joint six-year low, doves can take reassurance that time is on their side and there is no rush to raise rates.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, added that the combination of the government Spending Review this month and the mixed picture of highs and lows “makes it difficult to predict whether a searing rise in economic improvement is likely”.Only one member of the MPC is voting for a rate rise, but both Kristin Forbes and Martin Weale have made it clear they are weighing the options closely.Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC and a former BoE official, said a weak services PMI reading could have led any member thinking of a rate rise to hold off, but there was “little” in the data to persuade any hawkish member to hold off, adding “the bounce back today suggests the slowing in UK growth is only modest”.Markets are pricing in the first interest rate rise towards the end of next year despite most economists pencilling in February or May.
297;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-11-03T13:22:38Z;Private sector survey says construction is still growing;Orders and employment rise as housebuilding expands, says Markit/CIPS, contradicting ONS numbers;Orders, employment and confidence at Britain’s construction companies grew in October, according to a survey that contrasts sharply with official data.The Markit/CIPS survey of construction purchasing managers gave a result of 58.8, down from 59.9 in September. Anything above 50 indicates that activity is increasing, so overall levels remain robust.But this positive result is at odds with official data. Last week the Office for National Statistics estimated that construction output had decreased by 2.2 per cent in the third quarter.The ONS monthly construction statistics lost their status as national statistic in December, so economists are paying closer attention to private-sector surveys.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the industry was “firmly in expansion mode”. Companies had reported a rebound in new business in October and taken on staff at the highest rate for more than a year, he added.Much of the expansion is from house building, which is close to a 12-month high, although October’s survey reported growth elsewhere. Civil engineering activity remains more subdued at a five-month low.Stefan Friedhoff, managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial, said: “Optimism continues to be more prevalent than pessimism.”Results from many of the biggest listed companies indicated that margins were slowly improving, he added.The construction survey and a more upbeat manufacturing purchasing managers’ index than expected on Monday pushed sterling close to a 10-week high on renewed optimism about the UK economic outlook.On Wednesday the PMI for the dominant service sector will give a fuller picture, but the main focus this week will be Thursday’s update from the Bank of England on the UK economic outlook.While there has been a series of slightly weaker data, culminating in gross domestic product figures showing slower growth of 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, consumers, who have been one of the driving forces of the recovery, remain upbeat.Retail sales volumes surged in September the most in almost two years, and in a separate survey on Tuesday morning consumer confidence was at its highest since Nielsen began recording it in 2005.
298;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-11-02T11:43:50Z;PMI data boost hopes for UK manufacturing revival;Pound hits 10-week high after run of poor official statistics;Activity in Britain’s factories unexpectedly jumped in October, offering hope for the industry after a grim few months.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index rose to a 16-month high of 55.5, driven by a strong domestic market. A reading above 50 indicates that activity is increasing.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said the strong reading — the City consensus was for 51.3 — provided a “tentative suggestion that the manufacturers are pulling out of their recent funk”.Sterling hit a 10-week high on a trade-weighted basis on the hint that the sector could be showing signs of life.But with details of the survey suggesting the upturn was mainly confined to the largest manufacturers, most economists were cautious about calling a recovery just yet.Buffeted by the strength of sterling and weak demand in key export markets, manufacturing has experienced a torrid second half of the year and the industry still remains smaller than it was before the recession.Last week the Office for National Statistics estimated the sector contracted by 0.3 per cent quarter on quarter from July to September — the third successive quarterly decline.Markit said its survey was consistent with quarterly growth of 1 per cent — a vast improvement.Lee Hopley, chief economist at industry body EEF, said the bounce was “remarkable” and a “significant departure” from the declines in production reported by official data.“This is the first positive survey for manufacturing for some months and if this translates into an improvement in the official data, the sector could still post growth this year,” Ms Hopley added.Companies also reported a pick-up in orders from the Middle East and the US, offering tentative signs that exports could be recovering.Manufacturing employment rose for the 30th successive month as companies reporting an improvement in new orders and efforts to clear backlogs of work encouraged an increase in capacity.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said that if the improvement continued there would be “more conviction that UK economic recovery is at last ongoing and sustainable”.Most analysts, however, remained cautious. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank, said it was “important to see this trend both established over an extended period and reflected in the underlying data before claiming victory”.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, was even more blunt: “Take with a pinch of salt.”Martin Beck, senior economist at the EY Item Club forecasting group, said the data would “provide some comfort” for policymakers at the Bank of England who are meeting this week. Most indicators had been pointing to a loss of momentum over the summer, with overall GDP growth slowing to 0.5 per cent.Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, said last weekend that while the UK should prepare for a rise in interest rates, it was not a certainty.

The figure is above the crucial level of 50, which marks an expansion in activity, and is the highest for two months. While the August reading was stronger, 54 is one of the strongest readings over the past four years.Sub-readings for services and manufacturing companies highlighted that the main threats facing the region’s recovery are coming from outside the single currency area, notably from the slowdown in emerging markets.Most of the lift in October came from a better performance from the region’s services firms, with a separate reading for them rising from 53.7 in September to 54.2. The sub-index for manufacturing was unchanged at 52.An index for manufacturers in Germany, the region’s largest economy, fell to a five-month low of 51.6 from 52.3 in September. Services firms created jobs at the fastest rate in five months; the same reading for manufacturing companies fell to its lowest level since the start of the year.While manufacturing firms often rely on export trade, the performance of the services sector tends to reflect domestic demand from customers within the currency area.Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday the region’s monetary policymakers would assess at their next policy meeting on December 3 whether the emerging market slowdown required them to bolster their response to weak inflation.ECB-watchers expect the central bank to strengthen its €1.1tn quantitative easing package following Mr Draghi’s remarks and possibly push its deposit rate, now minus 0.2 per cent, further into negative territory.Falls in output prices signalled inflation, which fell back into negative territory in September, would remain weak in the coming months. Separately, an ECB poll published on Friday indicated that forecasters now believe inflation in the region will stay weaker for longer.The central bank’s quarterly poll of professional forecasters showed inflation was now expected to reach just 1 per cent next year, down from an estimate of 1.3 per cent in the second quarter. Estimates of inflation for 2017 edged down from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent."

While any reading above 50 indicates activity is increasing, the index has now fallen by more than four points in two months.Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, said the data were disappointing, adding they would give pause for thought to even “the most hawkish” members of the Bank of England committee that sets interest rates.While UK manufacturing has been hit by the strong pound and weakness in its main export markets, the far larger service sector — which accounts for more than 75 per cent of the UK economy — has held up well.But Chris Williamson, chief economist of Markit, said Monday’s data showed the weakness in manufacturing was spreading to the service sector, hitting transport and other industrial-related services in particular.On past performance, the survey is consistent with quarter-on-quarter gross domestic product growth of about 0.5 per cent for the third quarter of the year.Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said the surveys suggest growth remains “comfortably positive, but no better than average”.But Mr Williamson argued there was a “strong likelihood” that the slowdown could intensify, pointing out that collectively the three PMI surveys — services, construction and manufacturing — recorded the weakest prospects of new business for two and a half years.Companies surveyed reported an increased reluctance from clients to place orders and a rise in costs — linked to higher wages — but the prices they charged remained stable, indicating that margins may be taking a hit.Mr Williamson added there were now signs in his data that consumers were becoming more cautious and reducing spending on the likes of restaurants and hotels, while business confidence had been “knocked by global economic worries and financial market jitters”.Following last week’s disappointing US jobs figures, which pushed back prospects of the first US interest rate rise, many city economists have now changed their forecasts for a UK rise.Philip Rush, economist at Nomura, one of the most hawkish city voices said he was pushing his forecast out by three months to May 2016. Markets are now pricing in only a 50 per cent chance of a 25 basis point rise by October 2016.Martin Beck of Oxford Economics said the suggestion that growth was cooling “adds another reason for policy to stay on hold”.The rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is meeting this week, with the decision announced on Thursday.The outlook is weaker but economists were clear that prospects remained solid. Ruth Miller of Capital Economics, said that “given recent falls in oil prices, improving credit conditions and business and consumer confidence still strong, there are no obvious reasons why the economy should be seeing a sustained slowdown”.
301;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-10-02T12:10:44Z;Housebuilding surge propels UK construction to 7-month high;Worries about skills shortages continue to hamper sector;The fastest rise in housebuilding for a year pushed activity in Britain’s construction sector to a seven-month high in September.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey rose to 59.9, up from 57.3 the previous month. Some companies ascribed the surge to the relaunch of projects delayed earlier in the year possibly due to jitters over the general election.A reading above 50 indicates that activity in the sector is accelerating.The upbeat report saw sterling regain some of the ground it has lost against the dollar, where it has been touching five-month lows.The strong survey, combined with good results from the big listed housebuilders — Barratt, Redrow and Galliford have all recently reported double-digit earnings growth— will boost confidence in the sector after official data suggested the sector had contracted over the summer.The details of the PMI survey are also positive: both commercial and civil engineering activity picked up pace, staffing levels rose and only 6 per cent of firms questioned said they anticipated a slowdown in business activity.The only niggles were a slowdown in the rate of new business growth and continued worries about skill shortages — although this has the flip side of rising subcontractor charges for those sectors where expertise is in short supply.Tim Moore, senior economist at survey company Markit, said that there had been a “sustained rebound in new development projects”.He cautioned though that skill shortages were a “dominant concern” across the industry.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said that while companies were reporting higher staffing levels, it was a “continuing challenge to find specialist skills as they struggled to rely less on subcontractors to fill the gaps”.Mark Robinson, chief executive of local authority-owned built environment group Scape, said the industry needed to do more to encourage young people to consider it as a career.“The construction industry is not just being held back by a shortage of bricks, but a shortage of brickies. There is a lack of skilled industry talent at all levels and with demand for homes and supporting infrastructure on the up, current human resource is being spread too thin,” he said.
302;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-10-01T10:45:37Z;PMI survey reinforces gloom around UK manufacturing;First overall job losses in sector since spring 2013;Activity in Britain’s factories stagnated in September in the latest sign of the manufacturing sector’s troubles.The outlook for the sector is increasingly gloomy as companies struggle against subdued demand in key export markets, the strength of sterling and weak demand from the oil and gas sector.On Wednesday, official data confirmed that output had contracted for two consecutive quarters — putting the sector into technical recession — and Thursday’s survey data suggest improvement in the next quarter is unlikely.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index, published on Thursday, fell marginally to 51.5 in September, down from a revised 51.6 in August. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.New order growth slipped to its joint weakest pace in a year and companies reported the first manufacturing job losses since spring 2013. The domestic market continued to be the main contributor to any growth.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said the job cuts “send a signal that manufacturers are becoming more cautious about the future, which may lead to a further scaling-back of production at some firms in coming months.”Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said that with signs that domestic demand “is coming off the boil …until we see an improvement in export markets, manufacturing will remain under pressure.”He added that previous survey data — both the EEF’s and others — had suggested that manufacturers were waiting for the situation to improve but that the falling employment numbers in the PMI survey suggested they were now “giving some ground”.Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, struck a slightly more optimistic note, pointing out that the economies of the eurozone and the US — the UK’s biggest trading partners — are improving.“So for now, UK manufacturers might see export demand dwindling as the developing world struggles with slowing Chinese demand and weak commodity prices, but in the medium-term rising demand from the UK’s biggest and closest trading partners should help underpin a recovery in UK manufacturing,” he said.

US stocks followed Europe and Japan lower as worries about global growth and uncertainty over US monetary policy curtailed investors’ appetite for risk.Trader caution prompted selling of industrial metals and the buying of US government bonds, nudging yields lower.In New York the S&P 500 pared earlier losses to end the day down just 0.3 per cent at 1,932.24, with sentiment hit by morning news of Caterpillar, the machinery company considered an industrial bellwether, trimming its forecasts and revealing it may cut 10,000 jobs.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed down 2.1 per cent, edging closer to a bear market, with attention fixed on the region’s carmakers as the VW emissions scandal rumbled on. VW shares were flat after paring early gains and were down more than 30 per cent over the past week, BMW shed 5.2 per cent on the day.Analysts are becoming concerned that a slide in demand for German vehicles — VW, with about 270,000 workers is one of the country’s biggest employers — will damage growth in the eurozone’s largest economy.The euro, which has fallen from about $1.1450 since the VW news erupted, was up 0.3 per cent at $1.1223 after climbing as much as 1 per cent earlier on news German business sentiment rose in early September.Emerging market assets were again spooked by global growth worries. The Turkish lira and South African rand moved to fresh record lows, while the FTSE EM equity index was down 0.7 per cent, its fourth consecutive decline.The Brazilian real snapped back after tumbling 1.7 per cent to a new low of R$4.2478, rallying 4.5 per cent to R$3.989.10-year German Bund yields, which move inversely to the price, added less than one basis point to 0.601 after flirting with a one-month low as nervousness over the eurozone lingers.Equivalent maturity US Treasury yields were giving up ground, down 2.3bp to 2.127 per cent after hitting 2.079, while the more policy sensitive 2-year yield was 1bp softer at 0.68 per cent ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen later on Thursday.Ms Yellen was due to start her talk at 22:00 BST, with traders keen to see if she joins colleagues’ recent comments that stressed the Fed could still raise official borrowing costs from record lows this year after standing pat this month.Futures markets are pricing in just a 39.3 per cent probability of the Fed hiking at its December meeting, according to Bloomberg calculations. The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers and which in March hit a 12-year high just above 100.0, was consequently down 0.1 per cent on the session at 95.949, having hit 95.478.The price of gold was up $23 to $1,153 an ounce as the dollar and Treasury yields slipped.One of the reasons the Fed did not increase rates in September is because it was worried about how slowing China growth will impact the global economy.This week’s soft China manufacturing sector survey highlighted those concerns and now there is some disappointing news from the world’s third-biggest economy, too.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8 per cent in its first trading session this week after three public holidays, taking its cue from a downbeat global environment and dragged down by a weak “flash” September purchasing managers’ index.The survey, prepared by Nikkei and Markit, came in worse than expected at 50.9, undershooting economists’ consensus expectations of 51.2, and was the lowest reading since June.Sluggish international demand was the reason for the disappointing number, said Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit. “Underpinning the slowdown in total new order growth was a sharp reduction in international demand as new export orders dropped to the greatest extent for 31 months.“A number of panellists blamed a fall in sales volumes from China leading to a decrease in new exports.”The yen was shedding earlier gains and was 0.2 per cent firmer at Y120.02 worries over the economy offset by the currency’s perceived “haven” status.Other monetary guardians clearly share the Fed’s concerns about timid growth prospects.The Norwegian krone was down 2.2 per cent versus the dollar to NKr8.4559, earlier touching a 13-year low, after the country’s central bank unexpectedly cut official borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent. Taiwan’s central bank has also caught traders on the hop by trimming its benchmark interest rate to 1.75 per cent from 1.875 per cent previously.In commodities, Brent Crude was up 1 per cent at $48.24 a barrel but copper lost 0.2 per cent to $5,044 a tonne as the base metals sector succumbs to the broader market caution.Earlier action in Asia saw Hong Kong’s Hang Seng contract 1 per cent but on the mainland the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.9 per cent.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.5 per cent, rallying after closing below the 5,000 mark on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than two years.Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson in Hong KongFor market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
304;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Covered bonds outperform eurozone debt;Upside of relatively low yield helps asset class outperform other bonds in times of volatility;Covered bonds have outperformed other eurozone fixed income assets so far this year as sentiment holds up for the mortgage-backed securities issued by banks.In the eurozone, covered bonds have returned 0.3 per cent year to date, while standard non-financial corporate bonds have returned -1.5 per cent in the same period, government bonds have returned -0.1 per cent and German Bunds have returned -0.5 per cent, according to Markit data.Covered bonds, an idiosyncrasy of European debt markets for centuries, are backed by mortgage assets on banks’ balance sheets. Typically viewed as low-risk investments, the investor has recourse to both the issuing bank and the underlying assets in the event of a default.The level of protection on covered bonds means yields are much lower than on other types of debt. The upside of this is that they tend to outperform their counterparts in times of volatility and risk aversion thanks to their resilience and ultra-low risk levels.“Investor demand to gain exposure to the relatively safer asset class has accelerated in the wake of the recent market volatility,” said Simon Colvin at Markit.Covered bond yields fell to 0.21 per cent on average in April, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices, after the European Central Bank began buying bonds under its quantitative easing programme. For comparison, non-financial investment grade bonds reached a low of 0.85 per cent in April, while government bond yields fell to 0.4 per cent.Covered bonds have also received a boost from ECB buying, which amounted to €98bn by early July, although some investors have complained that the central bank’s presence is distorting the market, saying the programme dramatically reduces outstanding supply.Eurozone bonds as a whole enjoyed a strong start to the year as investors looked ahead to the March launch of the ECB’s QE programme.But since German Bunds sold off heavily in May and June, bond yields have risen sharply and prices have tumbled. Covered bonds now yield 0.4 per cent on average, while investment grade yields have reached 1.4 per cent and government bonds offer 0.8 per cent.The rise in yields, and consequent fall in prices, has dragged all categories of investment grade corporate bonds into negative return territory for the year, with the exception of covered bonds. Eurozone high yield bond returns are also still positive for the year.This reversal in fortunes has been reflected in flows into exchange traded funds. Up to June, covered bond ETFs suffered outflows as investors bet on riskier bonds that were outperforming. But as markets were rocked by volatility and bond yields surged, eurozone covered bond ETFs came back into favour, luring large inflows, Markit data show.
305;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-09-13T01:02:49Z;Securities lending raises worries;iShares is accepting ETFs as collateral;Institutional investors are lending out more bonds and accepting increasing amounts of non-cash securities — including exchange traded funds — as collateral, according to a recent report. But the practice is raising concerns among some investors some of whom are particularly concerned about the practice of ETFs accepting other ETFs as collateral.The trends for more bond lending and less cash collateral were picked up in the latest report from the International Securities Lending Association (ISLA), published on August 27. It said the €1.8tn securities lending industry had continued to move towards sovereign debt, with 39 per cent of securities on loan being made up of government debt, up from 35 per cent a year earlier. Of the €718bn worth of government bonds on loan, 72 per cent is taken in return for non-cash collateral, up from 61 per cent 12 months before.Among those institutions feeding the increased desire to borrow securities is iShares, the world’s largest ETF provider in terms of assets under management, which is owned by BlackRock. It recently scrapped the 50 per cent limit on securities lending for ETFs domiciled in Europe that it had imposed in 2012.In a statement published in July, iShares said it had decided to scrap the limit to “ensure clients can benefit from additional securities lending returns in funds where there is more borrowing demand”.But scrutiny of just one US Treasuries ETF reveals some decisions — over collateral — that investors might find surprising. In the 12 months to the end of June 2015, the $1.8bn iShares $ Treasury Bond 7-10yr Ucits ETF (IBTM), had lent out on average 47.48 per cent of its assets under management, generating a 12 month return of 0.09 per cent.iShares’ online information about this fund states that acceptable collateral includes “selected ETF units”, which last week included 10 iShares ETFs, including ones tracking US property and Chinese and Australian equities.Andrew Jamieson, global head of broker dealer relationships for iShares, insists the policy of using ETFs as collateral is “nothing new” and that ETFs “are a viable and liquid collateral type as part of a broad range of assets that you can use”.Ben Seager-Scott, director, investment strategy at Tilney Bestinvest, says he is “deeply concerned” by the securities lending programme at iShares and accused the provider of poor communication.There’s no conflict of interest and there’s no cannibalisationAnd Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at Seven Investment Management, questions iShares’ use of a Chinese equity ETF as collateral in a government bond fund. “What happens if you have a China ETF? Maybe it’s liquid, maybe it isn’t. What happens if China suspends trading on its stock market again?”Mr Jamieson insists iShares has an active discussion with clients. He says that for iShares to use its own ETFs as collateral is not doubling up on risk.“There’s no conflict of interest and there’s no cannibalisation,” Mr Jamieson says, although he accepts it would be a conflict of interest if iShares accepted as collateral bonds or stock owned by its parent BlackRock.Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management is also considering accepting ETF units as collateral. Keshava Shastry, head of capital markets at db x-trackers, says: “At the moment, we do not take ETFs as collateral, and will watch with interest how the market develops,” he says.The European ETF lending market is worth $26bn and has stayed flat over the past five years, according to Markit. The percentage of securities out on loan is consistently below 5 per cent, it says. Meanwhile in the US, there are some $90bn of lendable ETF assets, and between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of those assets are currently out on loan.Mark Schaedel, managing director of Markit index & ETF services, says: “There’s definitely more room to grow here. In the US, [using ETFs as collateral is] standard practice.”Other industry experts are less convinced. Kenneth Lamont, passive funds research analyst at Morningstar, says the practice adds an additional layer of complication.“For example, if the ETFs used as collateral are also lending securities, this means the collateral basket is exposed to counterparty risk — a less than ideal situation,” he says.However, Kevin McNulty, chief executive at ISLA, says that some commentators are “overthinking” the issue and that ETFs are a natural choice for collateral.
306;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-09-04T09:22:40Z;Short sellers keep sights trained on biotechs;Proportion of sector’s stock out on loan reaches highest level of the year;Short sellers are continuing to target biotechnology stocks as one of the frothiest sectors in US equities staggers after a bruising August.After climbing high during the seven-year equity bull run, biotech companies fell hard last month when the global sell-off sent the sector briefly into bear market territory and gave short sellers reason to cheer.Short sellers borrow shares they expect to fall in price, then sell them, aiming to buy them back later at a profit before returning them to the lender.Almost 90 per cent of biotech stocks on the Russell 3000 index of smaller-cap US companies fell in August according to Markit, and the shares that made the biggest declines were more heavily shorted.“It was a good sector play,” said Relte Stephen Schutte, analyst at Markit. “[Biotech] short sellers definitely made some money in August.”Short sellers have not relented, with the average short interest in North American pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences companies on the Russell 3000 gaining ground throughout August.The average percentage of shares on loan is now at 7.3 per cent, its highest level this year and well above the index average of about 4 per cent, said Mr Schutte. The figure is second only to energy stocks.Biotech stocks on the small-cap index are now down 12.8 per cent since their July peak, while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, which was up an impressive 31 per cent this year at its peak in the same month, has since fallen 12.9 per cent as investors pulled their cash from biotech exchange traded funds.BlackRock’s iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology fund was among those that recorded the largest redemptions in August. More than $800m, or almost 13 per cent of assets under management, left the fund in August, but the ETF has still returned 9.9 per cent this year.The noisy debate over whether a bubble is building in the biotechnology sector shows no sign of quieting, posing a dilemma for fund managers keen to exploit the rapid rise in valuations for companies that provide cutting-edge R&D in drugs and healthcare.Read moreThe Nasdaq Biotech index is still up 14.6 per cent year-to-date and has gained 470 per cent since March 2009, having been up as much as 580 per cent in July over the same period, making it one of the best performing sectors in US equities since the financial crisis.Like all equities, biotechnology companies have been lifted partly by the Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policy since the financial crisis, but also by investors chasing the returns that follow the discovery of new drugs.The exuberance in biotech stocks has led to comparisons with dotcom-era bullishness.Initial public offerings have swelled, with start-ups taking to the public markets to finance the development of drugs with blockbuster potential. In 2011 just 11 biotech and pharmaceutical companies floated, compared with 84 last year.However, the more traditional route — a licensing deal or acquisition by a larger, established pharmaceutical company — has not faded and the number of IPOs this year has waned slightly after 2014. According to Dealogic, there have been 37 biotech and pharma IPOs year-to-date.“IPO optionality is at play as acquirers look to snap up early-stage companies with compelling technology and large markets before an IPO,” said Silicon Valley Bank in a research note this week. It predicted that venture capital-backed biopharma mergers and acquisitions deals would exceed the 2014 total.
307;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-09-02T13:47:56Z;Emerging market economies slide again, data show;Latin America and eastern Europe are hardest hit as GDP growth and manufacturing wilt;Headline GDP growth and manufacturing dynamism in emerging markets (EMs) appear to be wilting in the key regions of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe, according to compilations of recent data, suggesting a continuation of the overall EM slowdown that began in early 2010.Overall, the estimated GDP growth rate across EMs fell to 3.4 per cent in June from 3.5 per cent in May, according to a GDP tracker compiled by Capital Economics that uses monthly data on output and spending to construct a proxy for overall EM growth.June’s estimated growth rate was the lowest since September 2009, when the tracker also estimated GDP growth at 3.4 per cent.The regional breakdown showed that GDP contracted by 1.8 per cent in June in emerging Europe (where the average was dragged down by Russia’s deep recession), following a 1.6 per cent fall in May.In Latin America, GDP growth hit zero in June, down from 0.2 per cent in May. Emerging Asia (excluding China and India) registered a 3.6 per cent growth rate in June, down from 3.8 per cent in May (see chart).The trend suggests no respite from the GDP tracker’s slide since it hit a recent peak of 9.2 per cent in March 2010. Separate data show that the slowdown in EM may have persisted into August, following the release of weaker manufacturing numbers polled by Markit, a financial information services firm.The EM manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for August edged down to 48.6 from 49.1 in July, the weakest reading since 2009, according to the Markit data. In theory, a value below 50 signifies a contraction in manufacturing activity but in practise it usually prefigures official manufacturing figures that show a few percentage points of growth.The PMI numbers showed a declining trend almost everywhere in the developing world, with the Bric economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China) remaining the worst performers. Only in two countries, South Korea and Indonesia, did the manufacturing PMI rise in August.The data reinforce a sense of gloom as one influential investor, Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, referred to an “emerging market crisis” in a column written for the Financial Times.“This emerging market crisis bears many of the hallmarks of previous episodes. All emerging market crises start in the foreign exchange markets before making their way through others: commodities, debt, equity and finally the real economy. This one is no different,” Mr Rossi wrote.This, however, is a minority view, with most EM analysts recognising manifold frailties in several regions but resisting characterisation of EM problems as a crisis.“Most recent data are not radically different from those of two or three months ago and don’t seem to justify the recent souring of sentiment,” wrote Mark Williams and Liam Caron of Capital Economics in a report.“We’ve argued for several years that EM growth was set to remain much weaker over the medium term. In China, the centre of recent concerns, there was a sharp drop-off in growth at the start of the year, but the economy actually appears to have stabilised recently — albeit at a far weaker rate than official figures show,” they added.Jianguang Shen, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities, struck a similar tone. “The recent depreciation of emerging market currencies has raised concerns that we could be looking at another Asian financial crisis. Our analysis shows that most east Asian economies, including China, appear to be in a better position than they were 18 years ago,” Mr Shen said.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
308;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-09-02T10:52:09Z;Housebuilding boosts UK construction industry;Sector is expanding at a slower place than it was a year ago;Housebuilding helped boost UK construction activity last month, but the sector is expanding at a slower place than it was a year ago.The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 57.3 in August, up from 57.1 last month, well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said companies remained on a “reasonably strong growth footing”, pointing out that demand for both staff and subcontractors is picking up.However, expansion has slowed notably since the start of last year when the index often showed 60 or above.In the second quarter of this year, the construction sector had quarter-on-quarter growth of just 0.2 per cent. In general, it has struggled to recover from the financial crisis, with output still below its pre-recession peak.Howard Archer, chief UK economist for IHS Global Insight, said that the “decent” August result suggested construction should make a bigger contribution to growth in the third quarter.The index has now been above the 50 mark for 27 months, the longest period of sustained growth for more than seven years.Housing remains the main source of growth, but commercial work is also showing signs of picking up.Respondents to the survey widely linked the upturn to improving economic conditions and strong demand from private sector clients, Markit said.But Mr Moore warned that there are “substantial skill shortages across the sector, with survey respondents reporting ongoing staff recruitment difficulties this summer”.This echoes research by the Local Government Association earlier this summer, which found that the number of construction qualifications awarded through apprenticeships, colleges and universities has dropped by 10,000 in the past two years, despite a 54 per cent increase in industry recruitment demand.Survey participants though remain confident about the outlook, with only 5 per cent forecasting that activity will fall over the next year.Stefan Friedhoff, managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said there was an “increasingly positive feeling”.“Encouragingly, contractors are now far more selective in the way they bid for work, so although pipelines are healthy, firms are exercising restraint. In the long term this should boost margins and, most importantly of all, ensure a more robust construction sector.”
309;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-09-01T10:45:07Z;Fears over sterling and China hit UK manufacturing;Fall in PMI survey reading raises concerns for rebalancing of economy;UK factories struggled in August as the strength of sterling and sluggish foreign demand continued to weigh on the manufacturing sector.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.5 last month from 51.9 in July. The reading was well below the long-term average of 54.2 though still above the crucial 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.The British economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the second quarter of this year, but manufacturing recorded a 0.3 per cent decline. Economists at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said Tuesday’s reading was consistent with a further 0.2 per cent quarterly drop in the sector.Consumer goods continued to power ahead, helped by robust domestic demand, but exporters limped along as new business fell for the fifth consecutive month. The production of capital goods was also weak.Analysts noted that the weakness of manufacturing — and particularly the exporting sector — bode ill for any rebalancing of the economy away from services. They blamed the strength of the pound, which has appreciated steeply against the euro, and the turmoil in China.Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: “Lacklustre manufacturing activity is worrying for hopes that UK growth can become more balanced and less dependent on the services sector and consumer spending.”“Manufacturers will be concerned about the ongoing strength of sterling against the euro, and they will also be worried that global growth could be held back by a marked slowdown in China,” he added.On the cost front, there were signs that low inflation is continuing to affect the British economy, with average costs for manufacturers falling at one of the sharpest rates in the past 16 years, thanks to low oil prices and a strong exchange rate, which makes imported goods cheaper.Employment growth turned mildly negative in August, according to the PMI survey, with staff headcounts falling for the first time in more than two years. This follows a string of puzzling job reports showing the steep fall in unemployment that Britain has enjoyed over the past couple of years has halted.“Particularly notable over the month is the drop in employment, which could signal an end to the job growth the sector has seen over the past two years,” said Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation. “All in all, there is little in the data to indicate that manufacturers are set to see renewed growth momentum in the coming quarters.”Net trade made a surprise big contribution to UK growth in the second quarter, confounding survey data suggesting exporters were struggling against the strong pound and subdued overseas demand.Continue readingElsewhere, there were signs that lending continued to increase at a good clip. Separate data from the Bank of England showed that the Monetary Policy Committee’s preferred measure of bank lending rose 2.3 per cent yearly in July, up from 1.8 per cent in June. The number of new mortgage approvals also went up from 67,069 to 68,764.“Net mortgage lending is now back to pre-crisis levels. Together with the surge in mortgage approvals this provides further evidence that the housing market is hotting up,” said Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the British Bankers’ Association.However, there were early signs that a possible increase in UK interest rates was starting to affect high-street rates. The rate paid on new household deposits rose to 1.55 per cent in July from 1.44 in June, although it was in line with the long-term trend. Mortgage rates on new loans went marginally up from 2.56 per cent to 2.57 per cent, halting nearly a year of continuous decline.The Bank of England is considering when to increase interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. Mark Carney, the governor, has said the decision will come into “sharper relief” around the turn of the year.Last Saturday, Mr Carney told a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that the recent market turmoil and the fears of a sharp slowdown in China had not affected BoE strategy.
310;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-08-21T08:40:00Z;Weaker euro boosts eurozone export orders;PMI shows region’s economy strengthened a little in August;The eurozone’s recovery strengthened a little this month as the weaker euro led to a rise in new export orders for the region’s businesses, according to an influential poll of the region’s purchasing managers.The purchasing managers’ index for the currency area, compiled by data company Markit, edged up from 53.9 in July to 54.1 in August — a figure well above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity and one of the highest over the past four years.The PMIs are watched closely by the region’s policymakers and the uptick will come as a relief after disappointing news on growth last week.The picture was less optimistic in the US where data also compiled by Markit, suggested manufacturing growth in August slowed to its weakest pace since October 2013. Businesses cited the strength of the dollar crimping exports sales together with weaker global demand, Markit said. The data could provide further pause for thought for the US Federal Reserve ahead of a decision next month whether to start raising interest rates.In the eurozone, preliminary GDP figures for the second quarter, published last Friday, suggested the region’s recovery lost momentum over the spring despite a cocktail of low oil prices, a weaker euro and aggressive monetary easing by the European Central Bank. The official figures put growth at 0.3 per cent, against 0.4 per cent for the opening three months of the year.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said the PMIs suggested GDP growth is tracking close to 0.4 per cent so far in the third quarter. Mr Dobson said this highlighted “the resilience of the economy through last month’s rollercoaster events of the Greek debt crisis and the ongoing negotiations to tie up the full details surrounding the third bailout”.Other analysts echoed that view.“The broader message today is one of resilience to shocks,” Edoardo Campanella, an economist at Unicredit, wrote in a note. “The eurozone recovery is mainly driven by domestic demand, while exports to developed countries remain reasonably well supported, offsetting the drag from the slowdown in emerging markets. As the impulse from past euro depreciation strengthens and falling oil prices work as automatic stabilizers against Chinese woes, the recovery remains on track for acceleration in the second half of 2015.”The PMIs suggested the services and manufacturing industries began to perform better towards the end of the summer. A separate reading for the dominant services sector hit 54.3, up from 54. The PMI output index for manufacturing rose to 53.8, from 53.6 last month.Policymakers in the region will also be heartened by further signs that the threat of a serious bout of deflation is receding. Selling prices for manufactured goods rose for the third month in a row, though prices charged to customers by companies in the services sector fell for the 45th straight month.At 0.2 per cent in the year to July, inflation is well below the ECB’s target of below but close to 2 per cent.
311;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-08-10T18:07:19Z;Noble relies on art of self defence;Chief executive delivers blunt riposte to critics and traders;Noble Group’s chief executive Yusuf Alireza delivered a blunt message to the critics and share traders who have rounded on the commodity business in the six months since questions were raised about its accounting: my company is not Enron.Mr Alireza, a former Goldman Sachs banker who heads up the Hong Kong energy and metals dealer, told analysts on Monday that he hoped Noble was at an “inflection point”, after a PwC review found no major issues with its accounting practices.“Enron didn’t go bankrupt and the people involved didn’t go to jail because they were compliant with accounting rules,” Mr Alireza said.“They want to jail and the company went bankrupt because they were committing fraud.”That Noble’s chief executive chose to publicly address comparisons to the bankrupt US energy trader — which collapsed in a multibillion dollar accounting scandal in 2001 — shows the pressure his group has been under since an unknown research group accused it in February of inflating its results through aggressive reporting methods.Noble, which has robustly denied any wrongdoing, has seen its share price halve in six months and the cost of insuring its debt balloon.On Monday, Mr Alireza revealed that some of Noble’s trading partners have reduced the amount of credit they would extend to the company, and announced a planned 16 per cent reduction in staff by the end of the year, in a drive to save money.Coming days may now prove crucial in determining whether Noble has done enough to ward off its critics. Some of them say that questions remain about the way Noble books profits on long-term sales and marketing agreements, sometimes several years before it receives any cash from the transactions.PWC’s report found this consistent with industry practice.With Noble dropping further hints on Monday that it has held talks with investors who might like to buy a chunk of its business, it remains to be seen if short-sellers such as Muddy Waters in the US will continue betting against the company’s shares or cover their positions.In recent days, the proportion of Noble’s shares out on loan — to funds that intend to ‘short sell’ them in expectation of a price fall, before buying them back at a profit — has risen to 14 per cent, according to data provider Markit.That is an increase on 10 per cent at the beginning of August, when short-sellers drove the share price to a six-year low. Shortly after, the short-sellers scrambled to square their trading positions after Noble’s decision to bring its second-quarter results forward, and news that it was in preliminary discussions with new backers. Mr Alireza said the talks were ongoing.“It’s going to make for an interesting trading day tomorrow,” said Markit analyst Relte Stephen Schutte, who noted that Noble had released its results at the end of a four-day holiday in Singapore, where its shares are listed.Noble will be able to restart share buybacks on Tuesday now it has exited a two-week “blackout” period ahead of its results. It has bought almost $70m of its shares since June, while the company’s founder and chairman — British-born former scrap dealer Richard Elman — has also added to his roughly 20 per cent stake.Iceberg Research, the once unknown analyst group that first criticised Noble’s accounts and compared the company to Enron, said PwC’s review was not enough to assuage its concerns. Iceberg noted that, while PwC said Noble’s treatment of long-term contracts met international accounting standards, the valuations carried in the accounts were the responsibility of the commodity traders’ management.“The market wants to know the real value of these mark-to-market contracts, not whether Noble successfully exploits accounting loopholes,” Iceberg said.Noble has variously dismissed Iceberg’s work as that of disgruntled former employee, an anonymous “blogger”, and “manipulator” of the company’s stock. Iceberg has denied taking a short position in Noble’s shares.Mr Alireza also tried to reassure investors that the company was working to ensure its credit rating, saying he had met rating agency Standard & Poor’s in London. S&P had threatened to downgrade Noble’s debt to “junk” status without greater transparency.He added that the company’s unlisted rivals, such as the privately held traders Vitol and Trafigura, operated successfully without a credit rating. He also pointed to a 40 per cent increase in Noble’s half-year trading volumes to 133m tonnes as evidence that the company was operating successfully even under tighter credit conditions.Barclays analyst Ephrem Ravi said Noble’s quarterly earnings were 10 per cent below the bank’s forecasts, falling to $62.6m, down from $106.6m in the previous three months and $68.5m a year ago.Noble reported a cash outflow from operations of $328m, adding to concerns about how much money the company actually generates from some of its contracts, where it acts as a middleman between commodity producers and consumers.Net debt was $4.3bn up from $3.9bn at the end of March — $1.5bn more than Noble’s market value. The company says about half its debt is tied to stocks of raw materials, which it argues it can easily sell to raise cash.UBS analysts said: “While management hinted that operating cash flow could turn positive in the second half, we think there remains limited visibility on when Noble will generate positive operating cash flow. With trading conditions continuing to remain lacklustre, particularly against a weak commodity price environment, we remain cautious on the fundamental outlook for Noble.”Noble has little intention of substantially altering how it accounts for long-term commodity deals, saying so-called mark to market accounting is a core part of how it operates its business.At the end of last year, “fair value” gains on its commodity contracts amounted to 90 per cent of Noble’s shareholder equity, compared with 0.2 per cent at Glencore and 3.8 per cent at Trafigura, according to UBS.“I fully understand that cash flow has to and must be positive,” Mr Alireza said, when asked to forecast when the company would start generating more money. “[But] we are a mark to market firm. We have been and we will be.”
312;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-08-07T11:22:39Z;Markit consults on CDS index revamp;Investors find instrument increasingly irrelevant;Hedge funds and asset managers who use a popular US credit derivative index are being consulted over plans for a revamp of the benchmark in an effort to bolster its credibility and usefulness for investors.Markit, the data company that oversees the CDX suite of US credit default swaps indices, has asked the financial industry for feedback about narrowing a divergence with the high yield bond market— often called “junk” — that the gauge theoretically tracks.Some investors and analysts have expressed concern at how the junk CDX index increasingly differs from the cash bond market, reducing its effectiveness at offsetting, or “hedging”, against deteriorating creditworthiness among companies rated below investment grade.Gross notional outstanding in the high-yield CDX has declined to $316bn at the end of July, from $390bn at the start of the year and from more than $500bn at the start of 2010, according to numbers from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.“The status quo that exists today is not acceptable for CDX indices to exist long term,” said Oleg Melentyev, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. “More and more people are turning their backs on this instrument because they’re realising it’s not working for them.”The CDX tracks the likelihood of corporate defaults and is used by investors to hedge cash bond positions as well as place bets on broader corporate debt. But there are several factors that make the gauge an imperfect hedge for investors.The sell-off in oil has hammered junk-rated bonds issued by US energy companies, but the CDX has suffered far less than the cash market due to the different compositions. While energy accounts for almost 14 per cent of a flagship high-yield bond index, it only makes up 4 per cent of the CDX. The junk CDX index has 100 underlying names, compared to 2,279 in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s US junk bond index, which means it is far narrower and discrepancies routinely crop up.The decline in trading of single name credit default swaps on individual companies is also an important driver for change, as Markit is required to include the most frequently traded contracts in the index, forcing it to include some companies that may have no relevance to the cash bond market.Markit is therefore seeking comment from banks and investors on changing its high-yield CDX to better reflect the composition of cash bond indices, according to people familiar with the situation. Markit declined to comment.The proposed changes would look closely at sector weighting and allow cash bond trading activity and the amount of a company’s debt that is outstanding to also affect the index composition.Comments from industry participants are due on Tuesday next week and any changes to the rules will be applied from September 27 when the next contract is issued.But some investors remain sceptical about the effect the changes can have due to more structural differences between the cash and derivative markets.For example, yields of the actual cash bond market are affected by rising or falling interest rates, while the CDX only reflects the ebb and flow of corporate creditworthiness.“You are hedging something which has an interest rate component with something that doesn’t,” said Fraser Lundie, a portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management. “It’s a blunt hedge if it is a hedge at all.”

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Any number above 50 implies expansion.Britain’s small and volatile construction industry expanded very quickly last year, according to the survey. The pace has slackened since then as the housing market has slowed, but activity continues to grow at a healthy pace. Construction companies are positive about the future: 55 per cent expect an increase in business activity and only 4 per cent expect a reduction.However, skill shortages continued to be a problem: the availability of sub-contrators fell sharply and their charges rose at one of the fastest rates since the survey began in 2007.The latest official statistics on the sector, which accounts for about 6 per cent of UK GDP, paint a gloomier picture. They suggest the industry’s output fell 1.1 per cent in the first quarter and was flat compared with a year earlier.However, economists are wary of the data. Last December, the UK Statistics Authority said ONS construction output figures would no longer be considered national statistics because of concerns about the methods used to adjust for inflation.According to the PMI survey, residential building has lost momentum since June, while commercial projects picked up some of the slack, expanding at the fastest rate since March.Markit said there was anecdotal evidence that improving domestic economic conditions had brought more tender opportunities, especially for commercial projects. Some construction companies also said that the resumption of delayed projects had supported activity in July.
315;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-08-03T10:20:37Z;Consumer goods prop up lacklustre UK manufacturing sector;Talk of rebalancing is still rhetoric rather than reality, say analysts;Britain’s factories are increasingly reliant on the consumer goods sector for growth, with new export orders declining for the fourth consecutive month in July.The Markit/CIPS monthly purchasing managers’ survey ticked up marginally to 51.9 from 51.4 in June, remaining just above the 50 mark which indicates increasing activity. While slightly above consensus expectations, the rise merely reverses the fall seen in June and leaves the index bumping around its lowest level since the first half of 2013.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said growth in the sector remained “near-stagnant” and continued to act as a drag on the overall economy. “Rebalancing remains firmly in the rhetoric as opposed to reality column,” he added.While the consumer goods sector continues to perform strongly, the survey reported a contraction in the investment goods sector and a lacklustre performance in the semi-finished goods sector.Within the detail of the survey, average selling prices rose for the second time in three months.Dominic Bryant, economist at BNP Paribas, said the upturn in pricing would add to the Bank of England’s confidence that inflation will rebound during the second half of the year, “removing another factor that has led the Bank to avoid tightening policy to date”.Sterling is riding high in the currency markets, partly on speculation that the BoE is edging close to its first rate rise since the financial crisis as the economy continues to expand strongly.But manufacturers are increasingly citing the strength of sterling, which on a trade-weighted basis hit its strongest level since 2008 last month, as a major stumbling block to increasing exports.The latest official data show that manufacturing contracted by 0.3 per cent quarter on quarter in the second three months of the year, and this latest weak survey offers little hope that performance is set to pick up.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was clear manufacturers were finding the market very challenging, adding: “Lacklustre manufacturing activity is worrying for hopes that UK growth can become more balanced and less dependent on the services sector and consumer spending.”
316;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Europe seeks higher yields of US bonds;Investors pour $5.61bn into Europe-based, but US exposed bond ETFs;European investors are ploughing money into higher yielding US bonds, buoyed by the divergence in central bank policy between the two regions.So far this year, investors have poured $5.61bn into Europe-based, US exposed, bond exchange traded funds, almost double the previous annual record of $3.98bn, according to data provider Markit.The rotation in fixed income flows across the Atlantic reflects a divergence between US and European monetary policy that has opened up a large gap between bond yields.European investors are betting that the price of dollar-denominated bonds, which moves inversely to yields, already reflects the extent of an interest rate rise in the US, or that further appreciation of the dollar relative to the euro is likely to compensate them if the price of US bonds falls on the back of tighter monetary policy.“Investors are thinking I can take a small bit of pain on my bonds if I make it back on the currency,” said Sean Taor, head of debt capital markets in Europe for the Royal Bank of Canada.The European Central Bank is buying €60bn of bonds each month via a quantitative easing policy designed to suppress borrowing costs and bolster the economy and inflation expectations. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve is on course to shift official borrowing costs higher in the coming months, representing the first tightening of monetary policy since 2006.Against that backdrop, US bond yields have risen since the start of the year, with Moody’s BAA rated corporate debt now yielding an average of 5.16 per cent, up from a low of 4.29 per cent in February.Overall, US fixed income funds have been recording redemptions, according to EPFR, as investors anticipate a rate rise from the Fed lowering the face value of US debt.Both Europe and the US have an underlying demand for the income provided by bonds, due to the pension requirements of an ageing society, said Roger Webb of Aberdeen Asset Management. “That being said you have seen some flows out of US bond mutual funds reflecting the proximity of the first rate rise by the Federal Reserve.”However, falling prices and higher yields tend to tempt other investors back into the market. When German Bunds sold off at the end of April, “you saw other investors who were waiting on the sidelines because yields were too low stepping in”, Mr Webb said.The spread between the current US 10-year Treasury yield of 2.20 per cent and the equivalent German Bund of 0.67 per cent is close to levels reached in March, which were the highest since 1990.Earlier this year, the 10-year Bund yield almost touched zero in the wake of the ECB’s launch of QE, while the yields of shorter dated paper fell deep into negative territory.At its current level, the 10-year Bund yields less than a quarter of its long-term average of 2.7 per cent, according to Markit.

Investors looked at miners as part of a China story and now they’re looking at how to understand and assess all these things.”Elad Jelasko, an associate at Standard & Poor’s, added: “In the last week, commodities have been under a material pressure across the board.“Unlike six to nine months ago, changes in the cost structures of the miners, such as foreign exchange or the oil price, are not the reason.”Instead it looks like a structural change in the market with China slowing down more than expected.Markit’s high yield materials index, which tracks the bonds of junk-rated raw-material groups, saw its yield surge to 9.5 per cent on Friday, the highest since the index began in 2009.The index yield has risen by one percentage point in the past month.Pressure has also emerged for higher quality debt, with yield on the Markit iBoxx $ Mining index, which tracks investment grade-rated bonds, rising to 5.35 per cent — the highest level since January.Freeport-McMoRan, the triple B rated gold and copper miner, this week saw its benchmark 10-year yield rise from 6.25 per cent to 7.1 per cent.Neil Mehta, a fixed-income analyst at Markit, said: “The sharpness of the drop in the price is more reminiscent of a high-yield name rather than an investment grade name.”The sell-off in debt for mining companies follows on the heels of a similar trend in US shale gas bonds. The collapse in the oil price during the second half of 2014 has pressured drillers, with many struggling to pay back debts.Oil and gas companies accounted for one-third of all corporate defaults globally in the first quarter of 2015, according to an S&P report published in May.Analysts are predicting a divergence in performance among miners as the price for some metals may stabilise and rise before others.Larger miners, with less debt loads are also seen coping better than smaller miners with weaker balance sheets.Moody’s currently has Anglo American on a negative outlook for its credit rating as it struggles to divest in a difficult market while Glencore is stable with a greater ability to reduce capital expenditure.Additional reporting by Joel Lewin
318;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-07-21T18:40:13Z;Dividend ‘spike’ predicted ahead of tax changes;Dozens of companies likely to move up payout schedules before April 2016;"Dividend payouts from UK companies are set to spike in the first quarter of 2016 ahead of tax reforms that will increase the bills of top-rate taxpayers, according to the research firm Markit.Dozens of small and mid-cap companies, plus a handful of large caps, are likely to accelerate payments before April 2016, when new dividend tax rates take effect, Markit’s analysts said.Markit compared the dividend tax change with a rise in the top rate of income tax in 2010, which prompted some 73 companies now in the FTSE All-Share to bring forward dividend payments, 57 to pay out second interim dividends and another 14 to make exceptional payments ahead of that increase.Housebuilders, insurers and investment trusts are especially likely to pay special dividends before April 2016, thanks to their strong balance sheets and cash flow, the analysts said.The reforms abolish the dividend tax credit and introduce a dividend tax allowance of £5,000 a year, while bringing in new rates for each taxpayer band. The Treasury expects to gain £2.5bn in extra tax revenues in 2015-16 from the changes, then to lose £890m in the 2016-17 financial year; after that, it expects between £1bn and £2bn in extra revenues each year.People who own and manage companies will be among those most affected by the changes, according to PwC, the consultancy.Companies with high levels of “insider” holdings, where management want to avoid higher tax rates, are among those likely to accelerate payments, along with companies that have a high concentration of investors with big holdings, Markit said.“It’s likely that investors with substantial shareholdings in listed companies will place pressure on management to distribute cash in advance of the new rates taking effect,” the company said.The FTSE 100 companies with the highest insider ownership are Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Royal Bank of Scotland; the latter is 62 per cent owned by the government. Sports Direct, Associated British Foods and Schroders also have more than 50 per cent “insider” ownership.George Osborne’s “major and long overdue reform” of dividend taxation will push up the tax bills of top-rate taxpayers receiving more than £25,250 in dividends a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal StudiesContinue readingOil and gas, basic resources and banking are unlikely to pay out special dividends this time, as they are suffering the impact of low commodities prices and tougher banking regulation, the report said.In 2010, companies such as WPP, Ashmore, Domino’s Pizza and Moneysupermarket brought their dividend timetable forward; Ted Baker and Monks Investment Trust were among those paying second interim dividends, while Hargreaves Lansdown, Moneysupermarket and Fidessa paid out special distributions.About 700,000 taxpayers are set to face tax rises as a result of the dividend tax reforms, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.They will increase the bills of a 40p taxpayer who receives more than £21,667 of dividends a year and a basic rate taxpayer receiving more than £5,000 of dividends, the think-tank said.The Treasury said the changes would leave 85 per cent of those who receive dividends unaffected or better off. Dividends from investments held within a tax wrapper, such as a pension or individual savings account, are unaffected."

George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said it seemed likely this was at least in part due to the rise in oil prices since the start of the year — notwithstanding their recent fallback.The ONS said recent tax breaks for oil and gas extraction might also have helped.If industrial production holds steady at it current expansion rate in June, the sector would have expanded 1 per cent in the second quarter — the strongest quarterly growth rate since the end of 2010.However, Ross Walker, senior UK economist at RBS, cautioned that while the headline arithmetic for Q2 looked good, “the trends in manufacturing suggest some cracks are beginning to appear in the UK recovery”.“It is hard to believe that the North Sea — one of the most expensive offshore basins in the world — can provide any sort of platform for sustained output growth,” he added.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research separately on Tuesday helped dispel some of the gloom from the manufacturing figures with its estimate that GDP growth had picked up 0.7 per cent in the three months ending in June, up from 0.6 per cent for the three months ending in May, implying 2.7 per cent growth in the past 12 months.
320;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-07-02T10:11:38Z;Survey data fuel optimism in UK construction sector;PMI report shows jump in confidence and strong order books;UK construction firms have started the summer in a bullish mood, with activity and optimism on the rise.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey for the sector rose to 58.1 in June, up from 55.9 in May, and well above the 50 mark which separates expansion and contraction.Looking ahead, 62 per cent of respondents said they expected output to increase over the next year, with just 4 per cent forecasting a decline — the most optimistic since early 2004.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said the industry was on a “real high” this month, adding “client expectations and strong order books were the recipe for success along with support from a resilient economic environment.”Anecdotally, respondents to the survey reported an increase in invitations to tender for commercial projects and robust demand for new home building.Recent changes to the methodology used by the Office for National Statistics have resulted in upgrades to estimates of growth in the sector, bringing weaker official numbers and stronger survey data closer.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the narrowing of the gap meant the survey “feels a bit more relevant” than it used to.He said the “punchy increase” in the survey suggested there was a “post-election catch-up” going on, with ground being made up on projects which had been held back.While construction only accounts for about 6 per cent of the UK economy, the upwards revisions were enough to nudge up the overall rate of UK growth to 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Mr Clarke added that if the survey translated into hard data, that would boost the case for “solid” economic growth in the second half of the year.However, within the detail of the survey there are indications that bottlenecks are beginning to build. Companies reported lead times from suppliers for materials lengthening and a rise in subcontractor charges.Stefan Friedhoff, managing director for construction at Lloyds Commercial Banking, said that while confidence was rising, margins were still under “huge pressure” for many companies.“Unfortunately, the causes of this — a shortage of suppliers and labour, project delays and demanding clients, among other things — are long-term industry issues likely to ensure slim margins remain for the foreseeable future,” he said.
321;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-07-01T11:03:08Z;UK manufacturing activity stagnant;Export orders fall as demand from Europe remains subdued;UK manufacturing was stagnant in June, with export orders falling because of subdued demand from Europe.The monthly survey of purchasing managers fell to its lowest for more than two years — to 51.4 from 51.9 in May, but remained above the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion.While consumer goods output for the domestic market continued to increase, new export orders fell. Respondents said the strength of sterling against the euro was partly to blame.It is currently trading at close to a five-year high against the euro, driven by worries about Greece and expectations the Bank of England will be one of the first central banks to start raising interest rates.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the survey, said manufacturing was in a “growth funk”, meaning the UK would be ever more reliant on the service sector to create growth.“It is also disappointing that for a nation now steeped in rebalancing rhetoric . . . domestic consumer-driven expansions remain the norm,” he said.Despite the slowdown, companies reported hiring more staff, with manufacturing employment increasing for the 26th consecutive month.Felicity Burch, senior economist at the EEF, the manufacturing trade body, said the data reflected continued weakness in demand in the oil and gas sector and from Europe.But she added that there were “some positive signs about the domestic economy underneath this”, with the expansion in employment “suggesting companies are still positive about growth”.On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics revised up its estimate of first-quarter growth for the UK from 0.3 to 0.4 per cent, mainly due to changes in its methodology for assessing the construction sector.But growth remains dependent on consumer spending and the service sector, with net trade a significant drag on growth.Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the manufacturing survey suggested the “ industrial side of the economy is playing no role in the economic recovery at the moment”.George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said that whether this latest decline in manufacturing growth was of concern for the overall outlook would depend on the upcoming services PMI data, which will be published this Friday.The latest data from the ONS, showed the service sector expanded by 0.2 per cent in April compared with the previous month.Sam Hill, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, said he thought there was a good chance that May and June levels would be better, adding there are “some signs of a post-election bounce have already emerged”.

The price is a small discount to Markit’s closing price of $26.25 on Thursday.Markit’s IPO a year ago stipulated that many of the banks that have backed its growth were able to sell a quarter of their initial stakes per year following the first anniversary of the company’s flotation.The London-based group, founded by a group of former credit derivatives traders including current chief executive Lance Uggla, debuted on Nasdaq in mid-June last year.The gradual exit extends a trend of the last few years in which the banks and brokerages that have supported Markit’s growth in the last 15 years have been steadily replaced by asset managers and longer term investors such as Singaporean fund Temasek.The IPO meant banks were no longer the majority shareholders.Markit is set to emerge as owner of some of the stake by using an initial $350m of a $500m share repurchase programme. Markit will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares, it added.Results for the three months to March 31 revealed turnover increased 4.7 per cent to $271.5m while pre-tax profit rose from $55.4m to $75.3m. Organic revenue growth was 6.1 per cent.Earlier this week, Markit bought Information Mosaic, a Dublin-based back-office processing software company, for an undisclosed sum.
323;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Eurozone bond gains for 2015 erased;Improving economic prospects burn debt investors;Investment gains for 2015 from owning eurozone sovereign, financial and corporate debt were erased this week as slumping bond prices inflicted a hefty toll on portfolios.Major indices tracking the year-to-date returns for bond investors turned negative as the German 10-year Bund yield rose to within a whisker of 1 per cent — in effect doubling in a matter of days.The sustained reversal in bond yields, which move inversely to price, from their nadir in April, reflects improving economic activity and expectations of higher inflation in the eurozone. That has challenged investors who had expected a sustained period of very low interest rates as the European Central Bank’s €1.1tn quantitative easing programme runs until September 2016.The rapid rise in government bond yields, which serve as a benchmark for valuing other types of debt, such as lower rate corporate securities, has registered across the broader eurozone fixed income market.“The spreads over benchmark yields are so tight now that any volatility in government rates is magnified and reflected in investment grade bonds,” said Simon Colvin, an analyst at Markit. But he added that high-yield corporate debt, which trades at much wider spreads over benchmark yields, has continued to perform well.Investors holding debt securities with long maturities towards 10 years and more have borne the brunt of this week’s sell-off and from the escalation of market volatility. The meagre level of interest rates provides little protection for portfolios against the upgrading of the eurozone’s growth and inflation prospects say analysts.“Lower yielding higher quality assets get impacted very badly,” said Barry Donlon, head of capital solutions at UBS. “Yields are too low to cushion volatility”.Returns on the S&P Eurozone Sovereign bond index that covers maturities from seven to 10 year years — which tracks the performance of government bonds — turned negative on Tuesday. The performance deteriorated further through the week, with year-to-date returns standing at -1.71 per cent as of Thursday.The iBoxx € Corporates, an index provided by Markit, the data provider, showed separately that this year’s returns on investment grade corporate debt dropped into negative territory this week — down 0.92 per cent on Thursday, the lowest level of the year.Year-to-date returns on eurozone bank debt were down 0.6 per cent on Thursday, according to a separate Markit index — their lowest level of the year.The performance of bonds has also driven investor flows this week dedicated to non-eurozone markets, according to EPFR, the data provider. UK, Switzerland and Sweden Bond Funds all took in fresh money with Denmark Bond Funds on track to set a new inflow record despite that country’s cessation of debt issuance during the first quarter to defend its currency peg.
324;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-06-03T10:12:24Z;Services data reinforce fears of slowing UK recovery;Purchasing managers’ survey shows weakest growth in five months;The UK services sector grew at the slowest pace in five months in May, raising fears the economy may have failed to rebound strongly after a disappointing first quarter.Activity in Britain’s dominant sector fell to 56.5, down from 59.5 in April and below economists’ expectations of 59.2, according to the purchasing managers’ index compiled by data firm Markit.While the figure remains above the 50 mark which separates an expansion from a contraction and the long-run trend level of 55.2, it follows other survey evidence showing the economy may have hit a soft patch in the spring. The Markit/CIPS survey for manufacturing earlier this week remained broadly flat, as a strong pound hit exporters.The string of unimpressive data will add to existing concerns of a slowing recovery. The UK was the fastest growing major advanced economy in 2014, but growth in the first quarter was only 0.3 per cent, marginally lower than the eurozone.“A marked slowing in the rate of growth signalled by the UK PMI surveys raises doubts about the ability of the economy to rebound from the weakness seen at the start of the year,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.New orders rose as they have done for the past two-and-a-half years, but at the weakest pace since December. Service providers also continued to create new jobs, but at the slowest pace since December.Other economists, however, warned against exaggerating the gloom. Retail sales were buoyant in April and there were also signs that construction was growing again, with the PMI survey in May edging up from 54.2 in April to 55.9.“Hopefully, decent economic activity over the coming months will support demand across a wide range of business services,” said Howard Archer, Chief UK and European Economist at IHS Global Insight.Meanwhile, price pressures continue to build, showing the UK may be emerging from its bout of deflation. Inflation stood at -0.1 per cent in April, well below the Bank of England’s target of 2 per cent.According to the PMI survey, input prices in the services sector grew at the fastest rate in eight months in May, as companies had to pay more for salaries, fuel and some foodstuffs. Output prices charged by services providers also rose last month, having fallen at the fastest rate in more than three years in April.
325;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-06-01T09:00:22Z;Tepid factory data add to Asian gloom;Manufacturing weakness across the region raises questions over global demand;Manufacturing and exports across Asia remained weak in May, painting a gloomy picture of economic activity in the region and raising questions about global demand.The slowdown at Asian factories correlates with limp demand in many overseas markets that buy their shoes, chips and ships. Data released on Friday showed that the US economy shrank 0.7 per cent in the first quarter, down from an earlier estimate of 0.2 per cent growth, highlighting the fragile nature of the recovery in western economies. Recent European data, however, have shown some signs of improvement.Although the official Chinese purchasing managers’ index showed modest growth last month, a private survey conducted by Markit and HSBC pointed to continued weakness in Asia’s largest economy.HSBC said the reading of 49.2 was slightly higher than the April figure but signalled that “operating conditions in China’s manufacturing sector continued to deteriorate”. A figure below 50 indicates contraction.China’s economy grew 7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, in line with expectations. However, some economists believe growth will drop further in the second quarter, with Nomura forecasting a figure of 6.6 per cent.Meanwhile, Indian PMI rose again in May, reaching 52.6 from 51.3 in April, according to HSBC.India has overtaken China as Asia’s fastest-growing economy, after reporting a 7.5 per cent expansion during the first quarter of 2015.However, many have greeted the Indian figures with scepticism, while Indian officials also lowered their estimate for fourth-quarter growth from 7.5 per cent to just 6.6 per cent.The Chinese PMI data chimed with gauges from Asia’s other manufacturing hubs that showed tepid activity. South Korean May PMI dropped at its fastest pace since August 2013, which HSBC said highlighted “worsening conditions” in the sector.Korea also posted a 10.9 per cent slump in exports, its steepest decline since the summer of 2009. Citibank analysts pointed to a range of causes, including weak global demand and a stronger Korean won.Taiwan, a key link in the global supply chain for electronics, also suffered a contraction in manufacturing in May for the second month in a row.“Data suggested that both domestic and international demand remained relatively muted, as a slowdown across a number of key export markets led to fewer new orders from abroad,” said Markit economist Annabel Fiddes in a report.Indonesian manufacturing remained in the doldrums for the eighth consecutive month, with the reading of 47.1 offering few signs of imminent improvement.Last week the Philippines reported first-quarter growth of just 5.2 per cent, far below analysts’ expectations of 6.6 per cent, as weak exports proved a drag on overall activity.Vietnam provided the one bright spot in Southeast Asia in May, with manufacturing activity rising to its strongest since April 2011, when the HSBC survey began.Many Asian central banks, including those in China and India, have responded to slowing growth by cutting interest rates this year. More loosening measures are expected in the coming months, despite fears that rising US rates will cause a wave of capital outflows from emerging markets.

German 10-year Bund yields have climbed 47 basis points since mid-April, and US 10-year Treasuries 29 bps over the past week.Such a rapid rise in yields has surprised investors and reduced broad fixed income portfolio gains, particularly for bonds with a lengthy maturity.“The back-up you have had on both sides of the Atlantic — in Treasuries and Bund yields — is what is driving most of the swings you are seeing in total returns,” said Hans Lorenzen, head of European credit strategy at Citi.In general corporate credit has not fallen as heavily as government debt, suggesting a degree of resilience in the market, while the recent rise in bond yields was enticing a hefty burst of new dollar debt issuance on Wednesday, led by Apple and Shell with large benchmark-sized offerings.“The interesting thing about this sell-off is that relative to government bonds corporates have held in well,” said Nicholas Gartside, chief investment officer for fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.Much of the weakness in the credit market is concentrated among holdings of long-dated bonds, a sector that enjoyed a solid start to the year, as investors were encouraged by the ECB’s launch of quantitative easing, suppressing borrowing costs.Global companies rushed to issue debt in Europe during the first quarter, taking advantage of investor appetite for fixed income by issuing longer-dated bonds at lower yields.Roger Blitz discusses this week’s market unwinding with Roger Hallam, of JPMorgan Asset Management. With the dollar down, the euro up, Brent crude oil close to $70 a barrel and bonds being sold off, is this a return to some semblance of normality?
Listen hereBut investors are now paying the price as bond prices for longer maturity debt are far more sensitive to changing interest rates, meaning the sharp rise in yields has inflicted substantial losses on them.British American Tobacco issued a €600m 30-year bond in March, which has slumped 14 cents to 90.5 since mid-April, underscoring the so-called duration risk associated with debt of a lengthy maturity.“A lot of investors were long and overweight duration, buying into the lower yields for longer argument underpinned by QE,” said Thibault Colle, strategist at UBS.“I expect the hit is pretty big and widespread. Because of the lack of liquidity, the adjustment has been more brutal, with moves in reaction to macro data several times larger than what they would usually be,” he added."
327;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Services data ease fears of weakening UK recovery;PMI survey positive but NIESR lowers growth estimates;Activity in the UK services sector accelerated in April, calming concerns that the overall economic recovery is slowing.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers ticked up from 58.9 to 59.5, its highest level since August 2014 and well above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction.The survey gives some reassurance on the general state of the economy after official GDP data for the first quarter showed the pace of growth halving from 0.6 to 0.3 per cent and weakness in the dominant service sector.Chris Williamson, chief economist of survey data compiler Markit, said it looked like the economy had rebounded from the start of the year and was now showing “robust growth momentum”.However, with construction and manufacturing PMIs weaker in April, he added there were “warning lights flashing about the sustainability of growth”.“Rather than rebalancing towards manufacturing, economic growth has become increasingly reliant on the service sector, and the consumer is having to drive growth as investment spending remains disappointingly weak amid heightened political uncertainty,” Mr Williamson said.Ross Walker, senior UK economist at RBS, said the survey had a “surprising spring in its step”, with the reading comfortably ahead of consensus city expectations.While the figures would “help assuage concerns about a more acute slowdown”, he cautioned that other data were “more ambiguous” and that the PMIs had overestimated the strength of official data over the past year.There were also conflicting signs in the detail of the survey about the outlook for inflation. While the prices charged by service providers fell for the first time since October, and at the fastest rate in over three years, input prices moved upwards with firms reporting rising wage pressures.Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the “crunch time” for the economy would come after the election. He added: “Given the fall in the jobless rate, wage growth should be sufficiently underpinned to lead to some upward pressure on output prices.”After five years of falling real wages, low inflation has meant that take-home pay has started to rise over the past few months. But despite signs from private sector surveys that a tighter supply of labour is giving employees more bargaining power, official data remain weak.The latest statistics show average pay is just 1.7 per cent higher than a year ago, but before the financial crisis it typically rose around 4 per cent a year.The Bank of England will deliver its regular quarterly update on growth, inflation and interest rates next week. Markets are betting an initial rate rise will not come until mid-2016.Earlier on Wednesday, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research lowered its forecast for growth this year to 2.5 per cent, down from the 2.9 per cent it forecast in February.It said that while the first quarter was “considerably weaker than expected” this was likely to be a “temporary deceleration”, with growth driven largely by consumer spending and the sharp fall in oil prices rebounding through the remainder of the year.The think-tank added that productivity growth remained the “largest single uncertainty” facing the UK, and while faster growth would ease fiscal pressures and boost living standards, even slower growth would “make matters considerably worse”.
328;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exchange traded funds global assets reach $3tn;Passive investing buoyed by central bank policies;Enthusiasm for exchange traded funds has propelled the global market beyond $3tn in assets, highlighting how investors increasingly prefer tracking broad trends.The rise of exchange traded funds and other so-called passive investing strategies has gathered pace in recent years thanks in part to central banks flooding financial markets with money and suppressing volatility. The sustained rise in asset values since 2009 has rewarded investors following a broad benchmark such as the S&P 500 or bond index, while so-called stock pickers and actively managed funds have struggled.According to data provider Markit, the asset class has risen above $3tn for the first time, coming after investors poured $98.46bn into ETFs during the first quarter, almost triple the $37.2bn of inflows for the same period a year ago.“It speaks volumes to the asset class and its rapid rise. These funds have been around for a while but have only gained traction with recent macro economic developments,” said Simon Colvin, vice-president of Markit.The news comes as Pimco’s Total Return Fund ceded its crown as the world’s largest bond fund to Vanguard’s passive Total Bond Market Index Fund, illustrating the shift in sentiment from active to passive management.The popularity of ETFs over mutual funds has also been fuelled by their lower costs, tax advantages and the flexibility associated with the fact they trade on exchanges like shares. For cost conscious investors, Pimco’s active fund charges 85 basis points, whereas Vanguard’s passive fund charges just 7 bps.“Passive funds, be it in equities or fixed income, have been the preference since the financial crisis. It’s quicker to put on positions and easier to invest,” said Brian Leung, investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Since the financial crisis, global central banks launched a period of aggressive monetary easing after the crisis, driving volatility down and fuelling powerful rallies in bond and share markets. In turn, investors have favoured passive strategies that track broad market trends.The best-performing ETF so far this year has been the Wisdom Tree European hedged equity fund, which tracks eurozone shares and hedges out the impact of the euro, highlighting the way these funds allow investors to take very specific, complex bets that would otherwise be costly for retail investors. Some $13bn has flowed into the fund so far this year.However, while ETFs have performed strongly under conditions of aggressive monetary easing, the asset class is yet to be tested during times of central bank tightening.With the first Federal Reserve rate rise in almost a decade widely anticipated in the coming year, ETF investors are cautious.“If we finally move back into a rising rate in environment, there may be an argument that an active manager, especially in fixed income, could be a better way to go,” said Mr Leung.“When rates rise there’s an inherent downwards pressure on bonds and you need someone more nimble to navigate these waters,” he added.Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, said: “We’ll see how they do if things get a bit more volatile as the US tries to switch to tightening, Europe is up and down and China tries to rebalance.”

The UK grew by 0.3 per cent in the three months to March, down from 0.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2014. A separate survey last week showed that manufacturing activity also slowed in April.“Together with a steep slowdown in manufacturing and disappointing gross domestic product data, the construction survey adds to evidence that the UK economy has hit a soft patch,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the company that compiled the data.This adds to worries over how Thursday’s poll will affect the economy. The Conservative and Labour parties are running neck and neck in the polls and neither is expected to win an overall majority, potentially leading to a phase of prolonged political uncertainty.“A number of survey respondents suggested that uncertainty related to the forthcoming general election had contributed to delays in clients’ spending decisions,” Markit said.Residential building activity was the best performing area of the industry, while civil engineering work fell for the first time in four months.The construction sector continued to create jobs, however, although at a pace that was below the average for last year.The UK faces its closest and most unpredictable general election in memory on May 7
Further readingCompanies reported an increase in the pay level of subcontractors, which climbed at the fastest pace since the survey began 18 years ago, showing it has become increasingly difficult to recruit new workers.Britain’s labour market has tightened significantly in recent months, with the employment rate hitting a record high of 73.4 per cent. Economists expect this should translate into sustained increases in wages, the missing ingredient of the recovery.Business confidence in the construction industry fell from the nine-year high it reached in March but remained above its long-run average.However, some survey respondents said they expected the outlook to brighten as political uncertainty disappeared after the vote.“If a sustainable government emerges from the general election and political uncertainty wanes, there are grounds for optimism on the construction sector over the coming months despite the recent weakened performance,” said Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight."
330;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-05-01T09:44:15Z;UK factories suffer slower growth in April;Figures highlight struggle to rebalance the economy away from services;Growth in activity at British factories declined in April, delivering more bad news for the economy just a week after overall economic growth came in far weaker than expected in the first quarter.The closely watched Markit/CIPS survey of manufacturing purchasing managers fell to a seven-month low of 51.9 in April, down from 54 in March. However it remains above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Companies reported a decline in orders from abroad, reflecting the struggle to boost exports with the eurozone.The only real bright spot for manufacturing was continued strong domestic orders for consumer goods.The disparity highlights the lack of progress in rebalancing the economy, particularly in light of separate data from the Bank of England out on Friday that showed lending to British consumers in March jumped by the biggest amount since before the financial crisis.Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data emphasised “the increasing dependence of the UK’s economic recovery on consumers”.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said the survey showed “less than positive news” on the health of the manufacturing sector.Disappointing economic data may perversely help the Conservatives by making nervous voters question whether they can afford to base their vote on any subject other than the economy.“A key challenge for the next government is to revive manufacturing and help it at least regain its pre-crisis peak, as any signs of rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and exports remain frustratingly elusive.”Following the weaker than expected data, the pound fell to a session low against the dollar and a three-week low against the euro.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said recent data pointed to a “marked loss of momentum”.She added that “while consumer-facing sectors are still forging ahead thanks to low inflation and a pick-up in wage growth, any sign that export growth was about to turn around at the end of last year now looks to have been a false dawn”.Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said the weaker survey data were further evidence that the overall pace of growth in the UK had slowed, but he did not believe there was “enough evidence” to indicate a protracted slowdown is on the cards.While mortgage lending remained subdued, overall consumer credit grew £1.2bn in March, the largest monthly increase since February 2008, the BoE said.After inching upwards for the past three months, the number of mortgage approvals for house purchases fell back to 61,341 in March from 61,523 in February.Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that while this could be influenced by increased caution ahead of the general election, it “reinforces belief that the housing market is likely to improve only gradually over the coming months”.Data from the Land Registry this week showed that the pace of house price increases moderated slightly to 5.3 per cent year on year in March, but a shortage of properties coming on to the market meant most analysts expected prices to continue to rise.There was slightly better news on business lending, with lending to non-financial companies ticking up £2.7bn.However, the overall trend remained downwards, with the 12-month growth rate still at minus 0.5 per cent.

While the figure remains above the 50 level that marks an expansion in activity, the reading is the weakest for two months.A separate reading for France fell from 51.5 to 50.2, dashing hopes that the region’s second-largest economy had shrugged off last year’s dismal economic performance and was starting to grow at a faster pace. Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas, described the French reading as “very disappointing”. New orders for French manufacturers fell at a strong pace, suggesting that industrial output would remain disappointing in the months ahead despite the weaker euro.The index for Germany, the region’s largest economy, fell from 55.4 to 54.2. While the cheaper euro helped secure new business for German companies, a slowdown in demand for some of the country’s exporters’ most important markets damped the impact of the currency’s depreciation on trade.The cheaper euro, low oil prices and the European Central Bank’s pledge to buy €1.1tn of mostly government bonds between now and September 2016 under its quantitative easing programme have boosted hopes that 2015 will finally see meaningful economic growth in a region that has suffered from years of crisis and stagnation.After months of positive news, Markit’s chief economist Chris Williamson said it was too early to draw firm conclusions about whether growth was faltering. But the poor performance of France was more concerning and appeared to reflect “a longer-term malaise which, after a promising start to the year, in fact shows few signs of lifting.”There were also signs that businesses and customers were becoming risk averse, linked in some cases to the rising possibility of a default by Greece.
332;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-04-13T22:17:03Z;Investors pile into eurozone inflation bonds;QE triggers rush for inflation protection;Investors are pouring money into exchange traded funds tracking inflation-linked eurozone bonds at the quickest pace in five years, highlighting a dramatic shift in inflation expectations driven by the launch of quantitative easing.The anticipated launch of QE by the European Central Bank last month spurred €400m into inflation bond ETFs during the first quarter, the largest inflow since the third quarter of 2010 when eurozone inflation was rising, according to Markit.Attention will remain intently focused on inflation figures to gauge both the success of QE as well as its likely duration.“The big point of inflection is the QE announcement,” said Simon Colvin, vice-president of Markit. “It shows that people are taking more notice of inflation and they’re looking to protect themselves from it.”Since QE was announced, the break-even inflation rate priced into five-year German Bunds has jumped more than fivefold to an eight-month high of 1 per cent, up from less than 0.2 per cent before the announcement.“There’s the question of whether the ETF flow is driven by the surge in inflation or further expectations of the working of QE — there’s the short term trading gain to be made from the jump in bond prices,” said Mr Colvin.Cameron Brandt, an analyst at EPFR said the inflows are “less a vote of faith in the broad strategy than it is a belief that if QE does work it could almost work too well’’.Inflation has stubbornly remained below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for more than two years and consumer prices have continued falling as demand remains low and energy costs fallen sharply.Consumer prices in the euro area fell 0.1 per cent in March from a year earlier, but that marked an improvement from earlier in the year, when prices fell 0.6 per cent in January and 0.3 per cent in February.In one area of the bond market, investors are looking for a turn higher in consumer prices.Last week, the German government sold €3bn of 10-year inflation-linked bonds at a negative yield of 1.09 per cent, even deeper than the yield of minus 0.89 per cent at the last auction in March, illustrating investors’ appetite for bonds that will gain in value should inflation rise over the next decade.While QE is fuelling demand for inflation-linked bonds, rising inflation could serve to hasten the end of QE, according to Didier Saint-Georges, managing director at Carmignac Gestion.“It’s one of those periods of very suspect comfort. I think people are complacent to believe that because [Mario] Draghi said so, he will buy 60bn until 2016, I think that’s a mistake — if inflation picks up,” he said.“When that risk [of deflation] gets pushed back Germany will certainly remind Mr Draghi that the only justification for QE was inflation,” he added.
333;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-04-13T01:14:01Z;Business activity jumps in England and Wales;PMI survey shows costs and sales remaining flat;Business activity in England is rising at its fastest rate for seven months and in Wales is at its highest since July 2014, according to a survey of Britain’s regional economy.Although London is leading the growth, activity in the West Midlands and Yorkshire & Humber also picked up significantly in March, as new business orders and backlogs of outstanding work grew strongly.The survey of purchasing managers by Markit for Lloyds Banking Group showed overall private sector manufacturing and services accelerating, but costs and sales remaining stubbornly flat.The England index rose from 56.9 in February to 59.0, surpassing the 2014 average of 58.3. It is the 29th consecutive month that the index has been above 50.0 - the level that signifies no overall change.Cost inflation remained flat, the result of falling manufacturing prices offsetting higher input prices at service companies. Average output prices remained steady.There remains “a continued lack of inflationary pressure in the broader economy”, said Lloyds.The London index for business activity rose to 61.8, an 11-month high, while in the West Midlands the index hit 61.2, a 13-month high.Yorkshire & Humber also improved at its fastest rate for seven months, but the east of England slumped to a disappointing 22-month low.The north east, the north west, east midlands and the south west recorded highs of between two and six months.Tim Hinton of Lloyds said the March upturn in growth showed economic activity was proving resilient.“Stronger increases in new business point to the economy retaining momentum, as firms bolster workforces in order to keep on top of workloads,” Mr Hinton said.Lloyds said jobs growth in Yorkshire & Humber was at its fastest since 1997, and employment rose in all England and Wales regions.Mr Hinton added: “Higher employment coupled with low inflationary pressures is likely to support demand in the months ahead.”Scottish business activity fell to a 2-month low to 49.4.The Markit survey is based on monthly replies from executives at 1,200 private manufacturing and services companies.
334;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Pricing a bond index is a vexed process;Passive investment in fixed income has hidden complexities;Passive investment in both bonds and equities is on the rise. But a process that seems like simplicity itself in the world of stock markets has hidden complexities when it comes to fixed income.Of more than $2.8tn invested in exchange traded funds, vehicles that follow the movements of an underlying index, almost a fifth is in fixed income, according to ETFGI, the London-based consultancy.But bonds and other fixed income instruments are very different from listed equities, where ETFs started out, and the indices the ETFs track are less straightforward. In particular, pricing the components of a bond index is a vexed process.“One of the problems is that not all bonds in the index might trade every day,” says Kate Hollis, a senior consultant at Towers Watson, the consultancy. “Or the bond may have traded but at a quite different size than you are contemplating.”A transaction for $1,000 is unlikely to affect the price, but a transaction for $1m could move it significantly, she explains.In the US, all trades in investment-grade, high-yield and convertible debt must be reported on Trace, a platform created by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator. Fewer than half of all reportable bonds were traded in the month of March, according to figures from Interactive Data, a market information provider.Establishing a fair price for the other half would be challenging. In Europe, the situation is even more difficult, because there is no obligation to report the trades and no transparent mechanism for collating and publishing trade data.“There are three routes you can go down for getting prices for a bond index,” says Astrid Ludwig, head of bond and complex indexing at Solactive, a recently established index provider based in Frankfurt. “You can use quoted prices, which is some trader just sending a quote to the market. The problem is this is one person who can have a large influence on the index.”The second option, using traded prices, has similar problems, says Ms Ludwig. A single trade in an illiquid instrument is not necessarily representative of a market valuation, so again it means a single trader has disproportionate influence on an index.It is also possible to use a panel of market participants to establish an average traded price. However, since it was discovered that interest rates such as Libor, which used this method, were regularly fixed to the advantage of those submitting the prices, this method has fallen out of favour.“Solactive uses evaluated prices,” says Ms Ludwig. This means it pays a data provider such as Interactive Data for its services. Evaluating prices involves gathering different kinds of market information, from individual transaction terms to the yield curve for companies, sectors and geographies, volumes of trade and time to maturity, to construct an imputed market price for any bond, regardless of whether it has traded recently or not.Another market information provider, Markit, runs its own indices, in particular the iBoxx fixed income family. It used to use a panel system to establish prices and, in 2010, commentators praised this as more robust than single-source pricing. Since then, however, Libor and other benchmark-fixing scandals have drawn regulatory attention to the conflicts that arise in such systems.Markit has updated its data gathering to include “enriched data sources to be as representative of the underlying single issue market as possible”, says Sophia Dancygier, managing director for indices at Markit. This means they are using Markit’s evaluated-prices services as well as other market data.This move stood Markit in good stead when the International Organisation of Securities Commissions published Principles for Financial Benchmarks in 2013. Although the principles call for transaction-based data to be used where possible, Iosco acknowledges this is not always possible and has consulted with the industry to establish best practice.The European Securities and Markets Authority has also taken an interest, promulgating its own set of principles in advance of a regulatory framework under construction in Brussels.During the consultation process, industry respondents pointed out that increasing the compliance requirements (and therefore cost) for those submitting price data to index providers might discourage some companies from contributing. The regulator’s response was to suggest that index providers should “develop policies to discourage withdrawals from panels and surveys”.The regulatory pressure on index providers pales into comparison with that on investment banks, another factor that has driven change in the bond index sector. Traditionally, bond indices have been provided by investment banks using data from their own trading desks. They were effectively given away for free (or for nominal fees) in order to encourage deal flow through trading desks.This situation is no longer tenable, as the conflicts of interest are perceived to be too high. “Banks’ compliance departments are clamping down on their trading desks sharing prices,” says Christos Costandinides, an independent ETF consultant who used to work for Markit, and before that db x-trackers, Deutsche Bank’s ETF arm.“This does not help with making data on prices.”While it is becoming harder to source panel data for independent indices, single-source indices produced by the banks themselves are also falling out of fashion, as banks get out of the business.“We see business coming from there [that used to go to the investment banks],” says Ms Ludwig at Solactive, “so it is good for us”.ETF providers are aware of the challenges of pricing bonds, which is why there is an emphatic distinction between benchmark indices, which may include a basket of up to 3,000 constituents, and liquid or tradeable indices, which will include anything from 30-40 to 500-600 individual instruments.It has taken a while to reach the position where there are freely tradeable indices, says Ms Hollis at Towers Watson. “People like to say fixed income smart beta (a term for bespoke indices intended to capture particular aspects of market moves) is where equity was five years ago,” she comments. “But actually a lot of the work we have done is just making indices better.”This might involve ensuring only the more liquid issues are included, capping exposure to sectors or regions, or even building different allocations between developed and emerging markets.…The environment for pricing fixed income instruments is even more difficult in Europe than in North America. In the US, all trades involving investment-grade, high-yield and convertible corporate bonds must be reported to the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (Trace), so transaction prices, where they exist, are publicly available. This means it is possible to offer a real-time pricing service.In Europe, by contrast, there is no single price-publication platform, and no obligation to report trades.“There needs to be some mechanism that makes prices freely available,” says Christos Costandinides, an independent exchange traded fund consultant.With vanilla bonds, at least, there is no obstacle to prices being published. More exotic instruments can be less transparent. Leveraged loans, for example, are the basis of some liquid indices in the US, but such an index would be impossible in Europe.“In Europe, contracts for leveraged loans specifically forbid price sharing,” says Mr Costandinides. “That is the problem we are facing.”Although regulators are aware of this issue, it is quite far down their long list of priorities, he adds. “Regulators are always working to make things better, but I do not see any game-changers coming up. We have not had a big accident yet, so it does not seem urgent.”
335;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exchange traded fund assets approach $3tn;Lower fees and broad exposure attract investors;Investors have continued pumping money into exchange traded funds and products this year, propelling the global market towards $3tn of assets, highlighting a pronounced change in trading across markets.Investors poured $96bn into ETFs and ETPs during the first quarter of 2015, more than double the $37.2bn of inflows for the same period a year ago, according to data provider ETFGI. Globally, the industry reached a record of $2.926tn by the end of March.The explosive growth of these investment vehicles reflects their lower cost than mutual funds and flexibility as they trade on exchanges like shares, but mirror the performance of baskets of securities or asset classes.Before the financial crisis, ETFs were less popular with investors, who favoured individual stock pickers that tried to beat the market. A pronounced reduction in market volatility in recent years as central banks have aggressively eased policy has enhanced the popularity of passive investment vehicles that track broad trends, with a fourfold rise in assets for the sector since 2007.“With central bank intervention in Europe and the States, in the last couple of years individual stocks are increasingly moving in line with each other so beta heavy strategies, which rely more on underlying market movements, have been popular,” said Simon Colvin, vice-president at Markit, the data provider. “It’s the death of alpha.’’Last year investors poured $323.3bn into ETFs, and this year flows have already hit $102.6bn, according to Markit.Retail investors, hedge funds and financial advisers are the main users of exchange products, attracted by how they facilitate broad exposure to countries, regions or asset classes that were previously out of reach to average investors.“They’re democratising investing,” said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI. “Investors have changed from seeing them as a passing fad or the enemy, because they’re passive rather than active, to a powerful tool.”The growth of the sector also reflects how they undercut the costs of buying mutual funds.“Because bond yields are zero or negative in many pars of the world, charging fees seems tough for many investors to reconcile,” said Kevin Corrigan, head of credit at Lombard Odier Investment, which recently moved into the ETF space.But the rise of ETFs has raised concerns about illusory liquidity and heightened volatility.Zoso Davies, strategist at Barclays, said: “One concern is the liquidity mismatch between what the ETFs purport to offer and the underlying asset. If ETFs need to buy or sell large positions in a short period of time, due to investment flows, that is likely to distort the market and increase volatility.”The launch of quantitative easing in the eurozone has fuelled a strong rally in equities and weakened the euro significantly. That has propelled large inflows into the Wisdom Tree European hedged equity fund, which tracks eurozone shares and sells the euro, allowing retail investors to gain the kind of hedged exposure that would otherwise be costly.It has attracted $11.2bn this year, almost twice the inflow of its nearest rival, the Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EAFE hedged equity ETF, which has attracted $6.27bn, according to Markit.
336;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-04-07T19:14:18Z;Eurozone corporate borrowing costs fall below 1%;Drop leads to dramatic 41% year-on-year rise in Q1 issuance;More than two-thirds of euro denominated corporate bonds rated as investment grade now yield less than 1 per cent as borrowing costs continue to tumble following the launch of quantitative easing in the eurozone.The European Central Bank’s bond buying has driven yields on government debt down to record lows, leading to a growing pool of negative-yielding sovereign debt, which has forced many investors into the corporate bond market.“The yields are getting to very worrying levels for investors and even frustrating levels because they have to decide which risks are worth taking,” said Thibault Colle, a strategist at UBS.Half of euro BB rated bonds — assets deemed highly risky by rating agencies — now yield less than 2 per cent, according to data from Markit and UBS, highlighting how growing demand for returns has pushed the yields of even the riskiest assets down to historic lows.As bond yields fall further, companies are pushing boundaries in terms of volume, maturity and coupons, while investors are being forced to rethink strategies and snap up riskier assets in the search for yield.The record low yields on corporate debt have made the eurozone highly attractive to borrowers, and debt issuance increased dramatically in the first quarter. Investment grade issuance jumped 41 per cent year on year to €97bn, according to UBS.Eurozone policy makers hope that driving down borrowing costs will encourage investment and stimulate growth in the trading bloc.“There’s been a big rally in that space and people have bought into it,” said Simon Colvin, vice-president of Markit. “It’s all been driven by government yields falling. It’s definitely a symptom of QE. It shows that it’s working and investors have taken note and they don’t want to bet against that trend,” he added.Companies have taken advantage of growing investor appetite for higher yielding assets, and lower rated firms have rushed to the market, driving volumes up significantly.High-yield corporate bond issuance is up 73 per cent year on year to €30bn, according to UBS. “In a way, the HY (high yield) frontier has been redrawn from between BBB and BB to between BB and B,” said Mr Colle.But the hunt for yield means investors are being forced to take on more risk to get the same returns, and that brings problems of its own. “The problem with single Bs is there’s a lot of unproven businesses in there. Our view is there could be negative surprises this year,” said Mr Colle.Companies have also turned the growing demand for bonds to their advantage by lengthening maturities, pushing the average to a record length of more than nine years in the first quarter.“The problem for next year is you’re going to start the year with sovereign bond yields at zero and corporate bond spreads at very tight levels — it will become a big deal for investors. The asset class is really becoming juiced out,” said Mr Colle.As well as buying lower rated bonds, the hunt for yield has driven investors to seek hybrids — bonds that combine features of debt and equity — and issuance soared to a record high in the first quarter. “It’s a consensus long, everybody loves hybrids,” said Mr Colle.So far this year corporate hybrids have returned 3.17 per cent to investors, surpassing the 1.42 per cent return of investment grade corporate bonds as well as the 2.97 per cent returns on high-yield bonds.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected a reading of 59.5.Tim Moore, senior economist at the survey data company, said the recovery has “lost some of its swagger”.While the reading is still well above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction, it is below the average of 61.8 for 2014 as a whole.But when asked about their outlook for business activity over the next year, companies were the most positive since February 2006.Mr Moore said companies were “highly upbeat” about their prospects for growth, helped by “improving economic fundamentals, strong order books and a healthy pool of new invitations to tender”.While the survey data are still showing a much more positive reading of the industry than official statistics, the slowdown in the index makes the gap less glaring.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector’s recovery is proceeding at a “gentler, quieter pace”. With confidence levels at their highest in nearly a decade “though there may be some low-level obstacles still to come, the sector gets the green light as there is evidently belief that the future for the construction sector is a sustainable one”.A number of companies also reported that clients were delaying spending decisions due to uncertainty about the outcome of the UK general election next month.The most recent data from the Office for National Statistics paint a picture of an industry in contraction, with output down in January by 3.1 per cent compared to the previous year.But any reading of the state of the industry is complicated because as of December, the official construction numbers lost their designation as national statistics due to concerns about the methodology used to ensure that the impact of inflation is nullified so that data can be compared over time.The ONS is set to provide an update on May 08 on its review of the statistics.
339;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-04-01T09:42:29Z;UK manufacturing activity hits 8-month high;PMI survey suggests economy is on course for a healthy expansion in the first quarter;"The UK manufacturing sector powered ahead in March, suggesting the economy is on course for a healthy expansion in the first quarter of this year.The purchasing managers' index for manufacturing, compiled by data company Markit, hit an eight-month high in March, climbing to 54.4 from 54 in February. The main reading was in line with expectations, but new orders surged from 56.4 to 57.9.The figures come just a day after the Office for National Statistics upgraded its estimates for growth last year to 2.8 per cent. A slowdown in January — with production, services and construction all contracting — had raised fears the economy might have slowed down ahead of May’s general election, but Wednesday’s figures should help abate these concerns.While the domestic market remained the main source of new contracts, there was also good news for exporters, which saw overseas demand grow after a small dip in February. The surge will help to soothe worries about the impact that the exchange rate is having on UK factories. The pound has recently strengthened against the euro, potentially damaging exports to Britain’s largest trading partner.“The PMI suggests that, if anything, the sector has stepped up a gear at the start of this year,” said Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation.“While the story of healthy domestic demand has become familiar over the past year or so, evidence is also mounting that the sector’s export prospects are finally turning a corner,” she added.Manufacturing employment climbed for the 23rd consecutive month in March, according to the survey , hitting a record high of 73 per cent. There are also signs that wages may have begun to pick up after a long phase of stagnation.The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists

Further reading“Continued job creation of around 5,000 new manufacturing employees a month also provides a decent bellwether that the labour market is still strengthening,” said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit.The domestic recovery was largely driven by a surge in the consumer sector, which is expected to continue in the coming month. Retail sales were particularly strong in February, as consumers made the most of the slump in inflation, which fell to zero for the first time in at least half a century. Capital goods producers also had strong performances.“The outlook for manufacturers seems pretty healthy on the domestic demand front, especially for consumer goods,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight.“Elevated consumer confidence, markedly improved consumer purchasing power and rising employment should underpin demand for consumer durable goods,” he added."
340;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-03-29T15:37:34Z;European payouts rise by more than 10%;Banks lead the way as dividends from Eurofirst 300 companies hit €187bn;Europe’s largest companies have increased shareholder payouts by the highest annual amount since the financial crisis, largely driven by greater contributions from the banks.Regular dividends from the Eurofirst 300 companies totalled €187.3bn in 2014, up more than 10 per cent on the €169bn paid in 2013, according to analysis from Markit.However, the data provider forecast a more modest rise of nearly 7 per cent to €200bn for 2015.The rise in shareholder payouts — which is higher than the increase in earnings — should help allay investor concerns that tougher regulatory requirements were making banks less attractive as investments.Spain’s Banco Santander paid out the biggest dividend of €7.72bn while Swiss consumer group Nestlé made the second-highest payment of €6.62bn.Within the 2014 total, banks accounted for more than 16 per cent of the overall amount, against 13.5 per cent in 2013. It is their highest proportion since before 2010.US companies have also been increasing their dividends to shareholders. Total payouts for 2014 were 12 per cent higher compared with the previous year. Markit forecasts dividend payments at US companies will increase a further 9 per cent this year.Despite European banks lagging behind their US rivals, their dividend growth was twice the level of the US. In Europe, bank payouts grew 32 per cent while in the US they increased 17 per cent.US banks contributed 6 per cent to the total dividends, while in Europe the figure was 16 per cent.The average payout ratio in Europe in 2014 was 53 per cent — 9 percentage points higher than the 44 per cent reported in 2010. More than half the relevant Eurofirst 300 companies raised their payout ratios last year while just one-quarter reduced them. French carmaker Renault was among the groups cutting its payout ratio sharply.At a sectoral level, utilities were still the industry with the highest payout ratio, at 73 per cent. However, this was down from 85 per cent in 2013. Thomas Matheson, an analyst at Markit, said the 2014 reduction was partly the result of a big payment by Veolia in 2013 that was not repeated the following year.After utilities, the next biggest sector was telecoms at 65 per cent. The largest proportionate increase in 2014 came from oil and gas companies, which increased their payout ratios by more than one-fifth to 62 per cent, though the collapse in oil prices is putting pressure on dividend payments in 2015.
341;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-03-24T13:37:39Z;Eurozone recovery signs grow stronger;Business activity rising at fastest pace in almost four years;More signs have emerged that the eurozone’s recovery is finally strengthening after years of economic stagnation.A closely watched poll of purchasing managers indicated activity in the region is now rising at its fastest pace since the spring of 2011.The flash purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone, compiled by data firm Markit, registered 54.1 this month, up from 53.3 in February and well above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.The index provides some reasons to be cheerful about the long-awaited upturn in currency area’s fortunes. Here’s why.1. A surge in new ordersMarkit calculates the PMI by asking about 5,000 purchasing managers in eight different countries across the currency area whether business activity has risen, fallen or stayed the same over the past month. At the same time, it also poses questions on what has happened to employment, prices and new business orders.The responses to the question on new orders have proven a bellwether for what will happen to levels of activity in the months ahead. The reading for new orders rose from 52.5 in February to 54 last month — the highest level for almost four years.2. The weaker euro is helpingThe euro might have ticked up against the dollar over the past few days, but the single currency is still worth about a fifth less against the dollar than it was this time last year.Mario Draghi has credited the weaker currency, as well as plunging oil prices and the European Central Bank’s landmark quantitative easing programme, for the pick-up in growth in the region.The PMIs support the ECB president’s case.A separate reading for factory activity in Germany, the region’s largest economy and one of the world’s biggest trading nations, rose at its fastest pace for almost a year, helped by the weaker euro.The decline against the dollar has also helped ease deflationary pressures, with the cost of input prices rising at the fastest pace for more than a year. That is welcome news in a region where inflation is now minus 0.3 per cent and has been below the ECB’s target of below but close to 2 per cent for about two years.The low inflation rate partly reflects the drop in the cost of crude, but the core measure that strips out oil and food prices is now at a record low, indicating that demand is weak.While the PMIs showed most businesses continued to slash prices, some managed to pass on the higher costs to their customers. The PMI reading for output prices rose from 47.9 in February to 49. That signals demand is strengthening a little.3. Businesses are hiring againThe eurozone’s unemployment rate remains worryingly high at 11.2 per cent. But it has fallen slightly over recent months and the PMIs indicate that trend continued into March.A separate reading for employment hit 51.8, up from 51.6 in February and the highest since August 2011. That signals some businesses are now confident enough in the recovery to begin taking on extra workers.While that’s welcome news, the jobless rate will not start to fall dramatically just yet. The recovery here is still modest when set against those of the UK and the US, where the unemployment rate is around half that of the eurozone’s. The pace of growth would have to pick up markedly before companies take on a lot more workers.
342;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Services survey fuels evidence of UK recovery;PMI reading follows growth in manufacturing and construction;"Britain’s services sector expanded at a healthy rate in February, providing further evidence that the UK’s economic recovery has gathered pace in the new year.The purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data firm Markit, showed activity in Britain’s dominant sector hit 56.7 last month. This is slightly below January’s reading of 57.2 but still markedly above the 50 level that separates a contraction from an expansion.The strong performance in services follows evidence of sustained growth in manufacturing and construction. The weighted average of the three PMI surveys edged up to 57 in February from 56.9 in January. This suggests economic growth in Britain is poised to accelerate in the first quarter of 2015, compared with the 0.5 per cent expansion in three months to December.“The UK economy is on course for yet another robust performance in the first quarter, with growth set to accelerate from the slowdown seen late last year, according to further strong PMI survey readings,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.“The PMI readings are so far signalling gross domestic product growth of 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, up from 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and in line with the economy’s long-term annual trend rate of roughly 2.5 per cent,” he added.Economists had forecast services PMI to hit an even higher level of 57.5. But while Wednesday’s number fell slightly short of expectations, survey respondents were positive about the outlook, with nearly 50 per cent of the panel forecasting a rise in activity in 12 months’ time.As retail sales in the UK continue to show growth, the FT keeps up with all the latest news and reports

Further readingThere was also evidence that service providers were responding to the rise in new business by hiring more, with employment growing at the second-fastest rate in the survey history.Higher wages and an increased willingness of suppliers to raise their charges meant that the rate of input prices inflation rose in February, in spite of the moderating effect of lower fuel prices. Output prices also increased for the third consecutive month.“Prices charged by services companies rose for a third successive month in February and at the fastest rate since September,” said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.“While the increase was still limited, this reinforces belief that generalised deflation is highly unlikely in the UK. Input prices also rose at a faster pace with reports of higher wages being paid,” he added."
343;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-03-03T11:23:19Z;UK construction hits 4-month high;;Building activity in the UK jumped to the highest level in four months in February, providing further evidence the economy has started the year on a good footing after a disappointing end to 2014.The closely watched purchasing managers' index for construction, compiled by data company Markit, hit 60.1 in February, up from 59.1 in January and above analysts’ expectations of a reading of 59. It was the 22nd successive month that construction activity rose above the crucial 50 mark, which separates an expansion from a contraction.Growth in activity across all sectors had disappointed in December, raising fears the economy may be about to slow down just before the general election in May.However, together with some encouraging signs this week that manufacturing has also rebounded, Tuesday’s survey hints that the outlook for the British economy may be brightening.More than half of the construction companies surveyed expected activity to increase over the next year, with only 9 per cent forecasting a contraction. Respondents linked new business gains to improving economic conditions and positive sentiment towards the business outlook.“The survey has recorded a remarkably strong spell of continuous growth since July 2013, fuelled initially by rising house building activity amid government incentives for home buyers but rapidly becoming more broad-based as the wider economic recovery took hold,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.“The latest data suggest that, while the pace of expansion has cooled since the peaks seen late last year, the recovery retains strong momentum,” he added.Residential, commercial and civil engineering activity all rebounded strongly in February. The construction industry continued to create jobs, though the rate of employment growth fell to its lowest value since December 2013.There are also signs that the strong demand for construction materials, together with shortages of stock among suppliers, is contributing to an acceleration in input prices. Robust demand for subcontractors pushed the average rates charged to the highest level since the survey began in April 1997.“With the purchasing managers reporting both manufacturing and construction activity improving for a second month running, it looks like the UK economy has picked up early on in 2015 after growth lost momentum in the latter months of 2014,” said Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight.“We are currently expecting gross domestic product growth to pick up to 0.7 per cent quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2015 after moderating to 0.5 per cent . . . in the fourth quarter of 2014.”
344;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors clamour for eurozone equity exposure;$19.3bn pours into European ETFs this year;Global enthusiasm for the eurozone has pushed investor inflows to record highs ahead of the European Central Bank’s full-blown government bond purchases, due to start this month.Some $19.3bn has poured into eurozone-exposed exchange traded funds (ETFs) this year, almost double the previous record for any quarter, according to data from Markit.“There’s a definite shift of sentiment towards the eurozone,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “It’s seeing the best opportunity it’s had since the financial crisis.”Europe fell out of global favour in the second half of last year as the region’s economies stalled and deflation risks rose.But this year, market attention has refocused on the eurozone, as investors have sought to position themselves ahead of a period of unprecedented monetary policy aimed at boosting inflation and growth in the single currency bloc.Greece saw particularly strong inflows with the sums flowing into ETFs tracking the country reaching the equivalent of 53 per cent of assets under management in the first two months of 2015 — despite tense negotiations over a bailout extension.ETFs are investment vehicles that are traded like shares but mirror the performance of baskets of securities and offer investors an easy way to bet on countries, regions or asset classes such as gold.The record ETF inflows underscore the investor scramble to gain exposure to the eurozone as economic indicators start to flash green.Equity funds saw inflows of $15.4bn as investors were seduced by soaring European stocks that have hit record highs in recent weeks.Meanwhile, bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have plunged to record lows as bonds are snapped up in anticipation of the entry of the ECB into the market.ETFs tracking the eurozone have attracted larger inflows than any other region in 2015, with the US drawing $6.6bn, the UK $455m and Japan $16.4bn.$15.4bnEquity fund inflows as investors seduced by soaring European stocks“Money is pouring in now, and I would anticipate with the asset purchases starting in March, that’s going to provide further upwards pressure to prices — for fixed income and equities, there are further highs to come,” said Mr Williamson.Funds offering broad exposure to the eurozone dominated inflows while Germany attracted the most inflows on a country basis.Germany received a welcome boost last week as February inflation figures exceeded expectations.The economy has recovered strongly since a midyear stumble in 2014, with falling prices and record unemployment stimulating consumer spending.“The eurozone has finally left the station,” said Karen Olney, analyst at UBS. “The majority of cyclical indicators are turning up: there’s the weak euro, lower oil price, an end to fiscal drag for the first time in seven years and a better credit backdrop.“If the eurozone can’t get cyclical growth out of this backdrop — it is hard to imagine when it will,” she added.Eurozone stocks have risen 14 per cent this year while Germany’s Dax index is up 16 per cent. Greek share prices have climbed 4 per cent.
345;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-03-02T11:21:30Z;UK manufacturing shows signs of rebound;Rise in February’s PMI comes alongside stronger lending data;Activity at Britain’s manufacturers has begun to bounce back from a weak patch in the autumn, reflecting rising output and new orders.The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for February, one of the early indicators of the momentum in the economy, rose one index point to 54.1. This was significantly up on a trough it reached in September but still lower than the highs it reached about a year ago.Coming alongside robust mortgage and lending data from the Bank of England, also released on Monday, the data suggested the economy was continuing to grow steadily as May’s general election approached.The rise in the PMI index, produced by Markit, the consultancy, was underpinned by companies reporting rises in output and orders, while export orders were down on the previous month. The overall level of the PMI activity index at 54.1 was well above the long-term average of 51.5, suggesting manufacturers had shaken off some of the concerns about European growth and the strength of sterling last year.But Rob Dobson of Markit said there were reasons to be cautious about the manufacturing upswing. “Scratching beneath the surface, we see a lopsided upturn, with the prime driver being a strong upsurge in new orders and production at consumer goods producers while a near-stalling of demand for plant and machinery points to ongoing weak business investment.”Manufacturers reported little sign of inflation emerging in the prices of their goods, and they continued to indicate they were ready to hire additional workers.Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said the services sector results, due to be published on Wednesday, were likely to be even stronger because consumers were more likely to spend their windfalls from lower energy and fuel prices on services. “It’s a bit like winning a lottery scratch card rather than a euro millions payout, but the point is it’s a positive and should help push the pace of quarterly growth upwards over the course of the year,” he said.The monthly lending data from the Bank of England showed a continuation of the themes from January, with steady mortgage approvals, rapidly growing household credit, especially for buying cars, and companies continuing to pay back their debts to banks.The amount of bank lending to non-financial companies has fallen 3.4 per cent in the past year, driven by a reduction in net lending to the service sector and construction companies, while the amount of lending to manufacturers was 8.2 per cent higher in January than a year earlier.The number of mortgage approvals for home purchases was stable at levels lower than those a year ago, having fallen after tighter restrictions on mortgage lending were introduced last spring. Consumer credit growth, excluding credit cards, was up 7.6 per cent in January on a year earlier and was fuelling the strong sales in the motor industry.George Buckley of Deutsche Bank said the mortgage lending figures were disappointing: “Housing remains sluggish, though lower mortgage rates, including record low two-year lending rates, should help support regional markets.”
346;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-02-20T10:22:46Z;Eurozone activity rises at fastest pace in 7 months;Data suggest region’s exporters are benefiting from the weaker euro;Fresh evidence that the eurozone’s economy may finally be heading for a meaningful recovery emerged on Friday, as an influential poll of purchasing managers showed activity rising at its fastest pace in seven months despite the stand-off between Athens and its creditors.February’s flash purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit, rose to 53.5, up from 52.6 in January and well above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.Falling energy prices, a weaker euro and the announcement of a landmark quantitative easing programme by the European Central Bank have helped lift expectations that after years of sluggish growth the region’s recovery will quicken in 2015.Although concerns linger that political risks emanating from Athens and the EU’s eastern borders will undermine optimism, regional GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 published last week were slightly better than expected — recording an economic expansion of 0.3 per cent.A separate PMI reading for the French economy suggested activity increased for the first time since April 2014 on the back of a strong performance for the country’s services sector.“The region’s second-largest economy is now seeing the strongest growth since mid-2011, with French consumers apparently awakened by lower prices,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.But despite improvements in the services sector, manufacturing activity in France remained weak.The pace of recovery has picked up for three straight months, according to the PMIs. The latest survey also showed companies employed extra workers at the fastest rate since the summer of 2011, with the sub index for jobs rising from 51 in January to 51.8 this month.Eurozone unemployment remains high at 11.4 per cent, with the figure masking deep differences between the health of labour markets in weaker and stronger parts of the currency area.Activity increased in both the dominant services sector and the manufacturing industry, with a seven-month high in the factory index suggesting the region’s exporters are benefiting from the weaker euro.The slump in oil prices meant companies’ input prices continued to decline, but at a slower pace than in previous month. Output prices continued to fall, suggesting demand remains weak, though the degree of contraction was the smallest since last summer.Germany’s PMI rose for the third straight month, although February’s rise was dependent on the strong services sector.
347;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK services sector makes strong start to 2015;PMI data follow good results in manufacturing and construction;The UK services sector grew strongly in January, according to a business survey published on Wednesday.The purchasing managers' index, compiled by the data firm Markit, showed that activity in the sector, which makes up more than 70 per cent of the UK economy, reached 57.2 last month, significantly above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.This is the 25th consecutive month of expansion and is above analysts’ expectations — a survey by Reuters forecast a level of 56.3. In December, the result was 55.8.The services figure is the latest in a string of strong PMI figures: both construction and manufacturing bounced back in January after slowing at the end of 2014.The composite PMI index, which combines manufacturing, construction and services data, rose from 55.5 in December to 56.9 in January, pointing to quarterly growth of between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent at the start of 2015.“The upturn in the PMI, and its elevated level by historical standards . . . gives reassurance that the UK economy is not slowing sharply but has merely seen its growth rate cool during the winter months,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit.New business orders in the services sector grew at a good pace in January and companies responding by hiring more staff. Employment growth was the second highest in the survey’s 19-year history, beaten only by the June 2014 result.Business input costs fell to their lowest level for five and a half years, thanks to falling fuel and transport prices.“By the second half of this year, we think it will become clear the UK’s deflation is of the ‘good’ sort and that interest rates need to start rising from emergency levels [of 0.5 per cent],” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics.
348;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-02-03T11:10:05Z;PMI survey eases concerns over UK construction;Sector rebounds in January but remains below summer peaks;Activity in the UK construction sector rebounded in January, though remained notably weaker than the peaks of last summer.Housebuilding, civil engineering and commercial construction all contributed to the rise in the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index to 59.1, up from 57.6 the previous month.Tim Moore, senior economist at survey data compiler Markit, said companies had now “found their feet”, adding that “the peak speed of the construction recovery seems to be over, but reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated”.The index has now been above the 50 mark, which separates expansion from contraction, for 21 months running. But while the January reading was much stronger than City economists had been expecting — the consensus had been for a fall to 57.0 — the latest reading was still the second lowest since September 2013.The data will ease some concerns about the outlook for the year ahead, after preliminary gross domestic product data from the Office for National Statistics last week estimated it had contracted 1.8 per cent quarter on quarter in the last three months of the year.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey was “pretty reassuring” suggesting that the sector is “seeing decent expansion, even if it has clearly lost momentum compared to the peak levels”.Construction accounts for roughly 6 per cent of the overall UK economy.The survey painted a mixed picture of employment trends in the sector. The rate of job creation fell for the second month in a row to its weakest rate since December 2013, alongside a sharp decrease in the availability of subcontractors.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said that because staffing levels have yet to catch up with the pace of new orders, activity “may slow down . . . as companies struggle to keep up with new demand”.“With supply chains under pressure, supply shortages, longer delivery times and a sharp fall in the performance of suppliers, there may still be challenges ahead,” he said.
349;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Oil price drop lifts UK manufacturing hopes;Purchasing costs fall at steepest rate since 2009;The slump in oil prices is starting to show on UK businesses, as a survey showed manufacturers’ purchasing costs falling at the steepest rate since May 2009.But while selling prices also fell for only the second time in five years, this drop was far more muted, suggesting companies used lower costs to boost margins rather than directly pass on savings to customers.Overall activity in the manufacturing sector increased slightly faster than City analysts expected, hitting 53.0 in January, up from 52.7 in December, according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers survey. The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction.There was also a modest increase in companies reporting new business from overseas — the first meaningful improvement in export order volumes for five months.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the “positive effects of the collapse in the oil price are clearly feeding through, helping to support demand while at the same time reducing manufacturers’ production costs”.But despite the encouraging signs, most economists are still cautious about the prospects for the sector this year, particularly considering the continued weak growth in the eurozone. But there are hopes that the European Central Bank’s plan to buy at least €1.1tn of assets to spur growth in the single currency area will have a knock-on benefit on UK exports.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said that while the figures showed the resilience of manufacturing in the face of global pressure, the domestic market remained the key driver of growth. She said she would need to see the increase in overseas demand “sustained in the coming months before we can call it a turnround in the sector’s export performance”.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said that despite the uptick, “producers clearly remain stuck in a low gear” and that the sector was likely to provide “little meaningful boost” to overall economic growth in the first quarter of the year.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said that while signs were positive, the survey “still points to a pedestrian pace of manufacturing production growth”, with several more months of improvement needed before the survey reached the robust pace seen last year.But Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, was more bullish, saying manufacturing’s troubles were “fading” and lower oil prices were an “unambiguous positive” for the UK economy.“Cheaper petrol, cheaper gas, cheaper mortgages, and a gradually improving main trading partner adds up to accelerating UK growth,” he said.
350;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-01-27T11:02:54Z;UK growth best since 2007 but losing steam;Annual figure of 2.6% is best since financial crisis;Britain’s economy grew at its fastest pace since the financial crisis last year, but a slowdown in the final quarter highlighted the extent to which the recovery is dependent on the service sector.Falls in building and industrial production weighed on growth in the last three months of 2014, when the economy expanded by 0.5 per cent, down from 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey company Markit, said that while he believed the UK would see another year of solid growth, “until exports pick up, growth is looking unbalanced, and once again all too dependent upon the consumer”.But despite the recovery losing some steam, Britain’s growth remains solid by historical standards and the latest figures mean the economy grew 2.6 per cent in 2014, its best performance since 2007.Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said that while growth for the fourth quarter “was on the weak side of expectations”, prospects remained good. “Easy credit conditions, collapsing oil prices and rising earnings mean that 2015 will be a good year for UK consumers,” he said.He was echoed by others, with David Tinsley, an economist at UBS, saying that while the data were disappointing “we aren’t alarmed”, adding he was “relatively optimistic this will prove to be temporary period of weakness rather than anything more enduring”.Joe Grice, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, said it was “too early to say” whether there was a general slowdown, as the contraction had taken place in industries such as construction and mining, which are always more vulnerable to sharp swings.Overall, most economists are upbeat about prospects for this year, believing that the rapid drop in oil prices will provide a spur to growth and take comfort that the service sector — which accounts for over three-quarters of the UK’s output — continues to perform strongly.Services grew by 0.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, with the overall growth rate being dragged down by a drop of 1.8 per cent in construction and a fall of 0.1 per cent in production, again raising questions about the balance of the recovery. And with the polls indicating it is increasingly unlikely that any one party will gain an outright majority in May’s UK general election, there are concerns that political uncertainty could weigh on investment, which disappointed in the third quarter.A 2.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall in energy production, partly due to the mild autumn weather reducing demand, dragged down the industrial production numbers. Manufacturing output was broadly flat, up 0.1 per cent on the quarter but making no overall contribution to growth.Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said there was a “more cautious mood” among her members.Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday morning, Ed Balls, Labour’s shadow chancellor, criticised the government over the figures. He said he was “concerned that economic growth is slowing”, adding that people were feeling worse off than when the government took over in 2010.But George Osborne, chancellor, said the recovery was still on track amid a worsening international climate, saying: “Britain has had the fastest growing major economy in the world in 2014.”The consensus expectation in the City had been for growth of 0.6 per cent in the quarter, and sterling dipped against the euro and the dollar on the figures as traders bet that the prospect for interest rate rises were receding.The January minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting recorded that staff were expecting the final estimate of GDP in the fourth quarter to come in at 0.8 per cent.All economists stressed that in Tuesday’s first preliminary release of GDP, only half the final data were available and revisions were common. However Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the growth figures would now need to be revised upwards significantly if they were to match the BoE’s expectations.But since much of the weakness in Tuesday’s numbers was concentrated in the more erratic sectors of the economy and the MPC was focused more closely on wages and inflation, the data “is by no means a game-changer just yet”, he said.While markets have pushed back their expectations for the first rise in UK rates to the summer of 2016, BoE governor Mark Carney warned investors last week that rates were unlikely to stay low for as long as they expect.Additional reporting from Kiran Stacey in Westminster.
351;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Eurozone activity rebounds in December;Purchasing managers’ index data soothe concerns that region is heading for another downturn;The eurozone recovery gained traction slightly in December, according to a survey of purchasing managers. The news eased fears that the region was heading for another downturn and signalled that activity could strengthen over the first quarter of 2015.The purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone, compiled by data group Markit, reached 51.4 last month, slightly lower than an earlier estimate of 51.7 but above November’s figure of 51.1. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.Improved readings for employment and new orders boosted hopes that the weaker euro and lower oil prices were beginning to revive confidence in a region where growth remains lacklustre.“The optimism is relative: PMIs remain subdued by historical standards,” said Evelyn Herrmann, economist at BNP Paribas. “But the improvement in the employment index and new orders are signals that confidence is gathering momentum.” .The reading for new orders, viewed as a bellwether of activity, rose from 49.7 to 50.5. Companies in the dominant services sector also started to hire more workers, with a sub-index for employment rising to 50.8, its highest since July. Higher levels of employment should also lift activity.The falls in oil prices and the euro are expected to support activity in the months ahead.“The oil price effect on households’ purchasing power is quite immediate,” Ms Herrmann said, while the weaker currency would strengthen manufacturing exports over the next three months.Readings for Germany and France rose to 52 and 49.7 respectively, confirming that activity in France, the eurozone’s second biggest economy, was continuing to shrink, although the pace of contraction was the slowest for eight months. The reading for Italy was the most disappointing, falling to a 13 month low of 49.4.The eurozone wide PMI figure will help to allay fears, which emerged in the summer, that the region would suffer another downturn. But the relatively poor readings for its three largest economies, which combined are responsible for two-thirds of eurozone economic output, suggest that a strong recovery continues to elude the currency bloc.“Of greatest concern are the ongoing downturns in France and Italy, alongside the stuttering performance in Germany,” said Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist. “Any signs of life . . . are in danger of being extinguished by malaise spreading from the region’s largest economies, unless business and consumer confidence revives.”Businesses in the region’s previously crisis-ridden periphery performed better, with the Irish index rising to 61 and Spain’s to 54.3.
352;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-01-06T12:17:52Z;Sterling falls amid disappointing UK services data;Data come as government sells 10-year gilts at record low yield;A slowdown in the UK’s services sector pushed sterling to a 17-month low on Tuesday, and provided a further sign that Britain’s economic recovery could be flagging.The Markit/CIPS survey of service purchasing managers for December fell to the lowest level in 19 months at 55.8, down from 58.6 a month earlier. While lower than City economists had expected, this is still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Sterling fell against most major currencies, weakening to $1.5184 against the dollar, which has been rising amid optimism that the US will soon raise interest rates. This stands in contrast with expectations of no imminent change in the UK and of more easing of monetary policy in the eurozone.The drop in the currency came as the UK government sold £2.75bn of 10-year bonds at a record low yield of 1.622 per cent.Chris Williamson, economist at data company Markit, stressed that it was “too early to get worried about a sharp slowdown”, pointing out that the PMI readings were broadly in line with the average in the years leading up to the financial crisis.But, he added that the “loss of momentum towards the year-end will no doubt fuel worries that the upturn is too fragile to withstand higher interest rates”.Separate data from the Bank of England showed a sharp fall in demand for mortgages in the final quarter of the year, with particular falls in demand for high-value and buy-to-let mortgages, reaffirming that the housing market is slowing.Lenders reported they had become less willing to lend at loan-to-value ratios above 90 per cent as well as at high loan-to-income ratios.Nick Beecroft, analyst at Saxo Bank, said the weaker demand for mortgages perhaps “spooked markets” more than the PMI survey. “Given the UK population’s obsession with home ownership and house prices, a downturn in this market could significantly impact consumer confidence,” he added.While consumer spending has continued to increase, the most recent official data showed a fall in households’ real disposable incomes, meaning that spending is being funded through a combination of running down savings and borrowing.The BoE data showed a marked jump in consumers’ willingness to borrow. Lenders responding to its credit conditions survey reported that demand had increased significantly in the final quarter of 2014 for credit card lending alongside an overall uptick in the total amount of unsecured credit made available to households.Simon Wells, economist at HSBC, said the credit conditions survey made “bleak reading” for UK households and suggested “the housing market slowdown is well entrenched” and that consumers may again be resorting to debt to fund spending.“This may be a rational response to low interest rates, but poses risks when interest rates do eventually rise,” he added.But Martin Beck, senior economist adviser to the EY Item club, was more sanguine, noting that the increase suggested “strengthening household incomes and the improving job security afforded by a tightening labour market” meant that “households are finally feeling confident enough to borrow again”.The data add weight to the view that the peak period of UK growth may now be over. Just before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics revised down the annual rate of the UK’s gross domestic product growth to 2.6 per cent in the third quarter, meaning growth while still strong is likely to miss the official 3 per cent forecast for 2014.Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said that while the PMI survey provided more evidence there had been a “soft end to 2014”, he doubted that the deterioration “heralds a more pronounced slowdown”.“Looking ahead, the halving of the oil price over the last six months should reinvigorate the recovery soon, by boosting consumers’ real incomes and making more production lines viable again,” he added.Corporate credit availability was unchanged for small and medium-sized companies, but up modestly for large companies.Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that the data reinforced the case “for more radical action” to support lending to SMEs.“Unless financiers, regulators, ministers and the Bank of England are willing to take a risk to help new and growing firms, only the usual suspects will have access to growth capital in the UK — meaning that a lot of great business ideas will either move abroad or fail to take off,” he said.
353;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-01-05T19:20:13Z;Companies must beware the dividend trap if earnings flag in 2015;Markit’s justification for forecast of 11% jump in UK dividends is part mechanical, part cultural;It takes front to wear a Hawaiian shirt to a funeral. Yet data group Markit has forecast a florid 11 per cent jump in UK dividends to £85.3bn in 2015. The economy of the eurozone, our main trading partner, lies moribund upon its catafalque. China is teetering on the brink of debt-related disaster (again). Show some respect, can’t you?In fairness, Markit’s figure is inflated by special payouts, including £4bn from GSK following its asset swap with Novartis. The estimated increase in ordinary dividends is 4.4 per cent, about the same as for 2014. But that still looks too high. A year ago, the UK economy was beginning a growth spurt and the eurozone was presumed to be on the mend.Those Dr Feelgoods at Markit offer a justification that is part mechanical, part cultural. Companies that account in dollars pay two-fifths of UK dividends. A higher dollar automatically lifts their payouts when converted into pounds.Behaviourally, sterling-based companies committed to rising or steady dividends are loath to abandon those policies, even if earnings falter. The shortfall can be covered cheaply by borrowing at current low interest rates, Markit points out.Yet there is a trap here for the unwary. Despite Greece’s best efforts, sovereign bond yields remain weak. This emphasises the yield appeal of equities, which paid out about 3.5 per cent of their price in 2014, according to Threadneedle’s Jonathan Barber.Playing to a gallery of income fund managers should be safe enough for most companies, with UK dividend cover below the long-run average. But it has perils for companies such as Vodafone, whose forecast dividends are higher than expected near-term earnings. Oil companies may also be prone to the belief, deluded or otherwise, that propping up the dividend is admirably manly.“Debt will come back to haunt some businesses,” predicts Mark Barnett of Invesco. That is a safe bet because predicting anything else accurately is so hard. Who foresaw Ebola or $55-a-barrel oil at the start of 2014?Ever-decreasing circlesTwo factions are emerging among big UK banks as they ready plans to ring fence their operations. Mods such as Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland want to lump as many businesses as they can behind the cordon sanitaire demanded in 2011 by a commission led by Sir John Vickers. Rockers such as HSBC and Barclays aim to erect a tighter barrier around their retail banks.New rules on ringfencing, the falling oil price and payday lendersListen hereThe implication is that the buttoned-down mods — both part-owned, coincidentally, by the government — have largely abandoned ambitions in investment banking. The rockers will keep the flame of freedom alive, but customers and shareholders may have to underwrite higher expenses for dual boards and shared service centres.At a ballpark £1bn-£2bn per big bank, ringfencing looks set to cost less than the £15bn originally prophesied by industry Jeremiahs. Their rebased lamentations would be more heart-wrenching if banks had not lost bigger sums paying for such errors as insurance mis-selling.Who knows? Perhaps lower access to government bailouts will inspire bank bosses to behave less riskily. However, reforms that are individually acceptable are becoming objectionable in aggregate. For example, UK banks may have to create a second ring fence to please European legislators, unless Britain can win a derogation. Proliferating regulation risks turning banks into compliance mills, for whom lending is an auxiliary function.Sarver palaverHow should Rangers fans feel about a bid approach from US businessman Robert Sarver? Their opinions matter — a season ticket boycott has, for example, hurt the finances of the struggling Scottish football club, which is listed on Aim.The response depends on whether “blue noses”, as fans dub themselves, classify Mr Sarver as a banker or a sports entrepreneur. He has done well in the first guise, as chairman and chief executive of Western Alliance Bancorp, a small bank based in Arizona. The shares have risen a stonking 600 per cent in five years and are worth almost three times book value.As owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team, Mr Sarver’s record looks decent rather than extraordinary. The team has finished towards the top of its division in recent seasons, but currently sits around mid-table. The disinclination of US sports entrepreneurs to spend heavily on players limits their popularity among UK football fans. They prefer two-fisted spenders from the Gulf and former Soviet Union.However, Rangers sorely needs stability. A takeover by a man absent from recent boardroom squabbles might provide that. It is a pity stakes held by other tenacious business figures, such as Mike Ashley of Sports Direct, may obstruct a buyout.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
354;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2015-01-05T10:55:07Z;UK construction growth slows;PMI survey shows housebuilding rising at solid pace;The UK construction sector expanded at the slowest pace in 17 months in December, due to a slowdown in the rate of growth of commercial and residential activity.The latest purchasing managers’ index by data firm Markit/CIPS registered a 57.6 reading, down from 59.4 in November. While the pace of growth eased for the third month in a row, this was still above the crucial 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.“The [construction] sector is still expanding, with the index posting at a higher level than the longer-term average . . . but it has become a victim of its own success as it struggles to keep up with its own speed of recovery,” said David Noble at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.The three categories of output included in the index showed diverging trends in December. House building and commercial construction continued to rise at a solid pace, even though the rate was slower than in previous months. Civil engineering activity fell slightly, ending a 17-month streak of continuous expansion.“UK construction output growth retreated further in December, but another strong expansion of house building activity ensured that the sector continued to perform impressively overall,” said Tim Moore, Senior Economist at Markit.Confidence in the construction sector remains high, with 52 per cent of survey respondents predicting a rise in business activity over the course of 2015 and only 13 per cent forecasting a contraction. New business volumes continued to rise in December, even though the rate of expansion fell for the sixth month in a row and was the slowest since June 2013.While the rate of hiring remained above the long-term average, job creation was slightly below the November figure, with several companies highlighting worsening skill shortages across the sector.“[Last month’s] slowdown should prove to be mild and temporary, with cheaper oil and money ready to fire up the economic engines again in the new year. Inflation should fall close to zero, providing a big boost to consumers spending power and driving growth higher by the middle of the year,” said Robert Wood, an economist at Beremberg Economics.
355;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK manufacturing growth tapers off;2014 positive overall but exports remain weak spot;British manufacturing expanded more slowly than expected in December after new orders from overseas clients failed to pick up, according to a survey published on Friday.Exports remained the main weak spot for manufacturers, according to data collected from purchasing managers that showed the second slowest rate of growth in production and new orders for over one-and-a-half years.The Purchasing Managers’ Index from information provider Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply fell to a three-month low of 52.5 from 53.3 in November. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted a rise to 53.7.Despite the December slowdown, the survey’s compilers said growth remained solid, with the latest figures extending the unbroken period of expansion in production and new orders to 22 months.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “Despite this end of year tapering, the sector still performed well over 2014 as a whole, with growth averaging at its highest since 2010.”Price pressures remained subdued with falling average input prices for the fourth month running — the fastest pace in almost two-and-a-half years. There were reports of lower costs for chemicals, energy, metals, oil and plastics.David Noble, group chief executive officer at CIPS, said the reduction in commodity costs coupled with a slight increase in output prices had reduced the squeeze on margins.He said growth remained solid. “In summary the picture is one of constancy and a good basis for operation for the sector in 2015 if the levels of risk and opportunity remain the same and the global economic landscape offers similar prospects.”Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the “modestly” weaker-than-expected survey was likely to underscore the belief that the Bank of England would not raise interest rates before the latter months of 2015, particularly as it showed weak price pressures.The domestic market remained the prime source of new contracts, with the level of export orders staying unchanged over the month in December, following back-to-back declines in October and November. Purchasing managers reported improved demand from North America and the Middle East. But there was a more mixed picture from the euro area, with some manufacturers signalling an increase in new work received and others a decline.UK manufacturing employment rose for the 20th month in a row during December, with the rate of jobs growth little changed from November’s four-month high.
356;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-12-28T21:08:36Z;Rush for exposure to US economic recovery drives ETF inflows;Trend reflects investor optimism in the country’s growth prospects relative to other economies;A scramble for exposure to the US’s economic recovery dominated flows into fast-growing exchange traded funds in 2014, and contrasted with fading investor enthusiasm for Europe.International flows into all ETFs with exposure to the US this year were equivalent to almost 50 per cent of starting assets under management — the strongest since 2008, according to an analysis for the Financial Times by Markit, the financial data provider.ETFs trade like stocks but track baskets of securities and are used by investors as an easy way to take bets on economies or regions. The asset class has expanded rapidly in recent years with total assets under management increasing 16 per cent to $2.7tn in 2014. ETF data provide an up-to-date guide to investor trends.The popularity of US-orientated ETFs reflected investor optimism in the country’s growth prospects relative to other economies.“The dollar is rallying, the US economy is doing quite well, and the US S&P 500 is also doing quite well,” said Simon Colvin, research analyst at Markit. “Investors are clamouring to get exposure.”Growth data released last week showed the US economy grew in the third quarter of 2014 at its fastest pace for a decade. But continental European economies continue to flirt with recession.The transatlantic divergence in economic fortunes was also reflected in ETF sales, with international inflows into European-focused funds last year equivalent to just 16 per cent of assets under management. Internationally-listed European ETFs had more than doubled in size in 2013.Even though inflows were still positive overall, the annual figures masked a sharp shift in global sentiment towards Europe during 2014. Initially, global investors saw the continent recovering from its debt crisis. But inflows into European ETF equities “faded as expectations for Europe’s economy deteriorated and deflation concerns emerged”, reported BlackRock in a separate review of 2014 flows. A weakening euro also hit global investors’ holdings.However a country breakdown by Markit showed Spanish ETFs showing the strongest growth in 2014 among established ETF markets, with Italian ETFs also expanding rapidly.Russian ETFs also saw large inflows — although from a low base — underscoring how investors are using such products to place tactical bets. “No matter how bad the news got with the Ukraine crisis and the fall in oil [prices], investors kept adding to their exposure,” said Mr Colvin. India also proved popular with ETFs providing an relatively easy way to profit from Narendra Modi’s election as prime minister in May.By contrast, German ETFs saw large outflows, although the data were distorted by $10bn redemptions from an iShares fund based on Germany’s DAX share index, according to Markit. One explanation is the investors switched from German equities into safer European bond markets.
357;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-12-18T10:17:23Z;Black Friday discounts boost UK retail sales;Fastest monthly growth in a decade lifts markets;UK retail sales surged in November, growing at the fastest pace in a decade as consumers took advantage of pre-Christmas discounts.The quantity of goods bought on the high street was up 6.4 per cent compared with the previous November, the highest year-on-year increase since May 2004, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. On a monthly basis, sales were up 1.6 per cent — substantially in excess of the 0.3 per cent expected by city analysts.Heavy competition and discounting by retailers, as well as the fall in the price of oil, saw average store prices fall 2 per cent compared with the previous year.The figures were boosted this year by “Black Friday” — a sale on the day after Thanksgiving that has been imported from the US and embraced by UK retailers. Last year, the discount day fell into the December figures.Phillip Shaw, economist at Investec, cautioned that the exceptionally strong figures could just represent a shift in shopping patterns rather than additional spending by consumers, and that he expected next month’s numbers to dip. But he said there were “no signs that UK consumer spending is running out of steam”.On Wednesday, Sebastian James, the chief executive of Dixons Carphone said that Black Friday had usurped Boxing Day as the primary shopping day in the UK, and admitted it had “definitely” brought forward some sales that would normally occur in December.All retail sectors saw an uptick in the volume of goods bought, with the largest contribution from the non-food stores sector. Performance was particularly strong in electrical goods, increasing 32 per cent on the year.UK stocks, government bonds and sterling all jumped on the stronger than expected data, with sterling rising 0.5 per cent versus the dollar to a session high of $1.56, while also advancing 0.7 per cent against the euro to 78.71p.Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said the numbers showed UK consumers were “taking full advantage of the fall in inflation and heading to the shops”.The dramatic fall in the price of oil has helped to drive inflation to the lowest level in 10 years, and with the first tentative signs of wage growth returning many households will be getting the first income boost after five years of being squeezed.“For now, British consumers are adopting their usual mantra in response to a windfall — spend, spend, spend,” Mr Wells said.Industry figures said that while Black Friday had undoubtedly brought forward some spending, that did not mean the spending splurge was necessarily over. Richard Lowe, head of retail at Barclays, said their research found that UK retailers were expecting this Saturday to be their busiest in-store day, and David McCorquodale, UK head of retail at KPMG, pointed out that next week was the more important time of the year for grocers “and they are fiercely competing to secure what will be the biggest shop of the year for the average consumer”.
358;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-12-08T09:24:00Z;Temasek buys stake in high-speed trader;Singapore’s investment company takes minority holding in Virtu Financial;Temasek, the Singaporean state investment company, has made a further bet on the technology that is overhauling trading by taking a minority stake in Virtu Financial, the US electronic market maker.The Asian investor has purchased part of the stake previously owned by Silver Lake Partners, the US private equity group, the companies said in a statement on Monday.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Silver Lake will continue to be a minority shareholder in Virtu.The deal is the second high-profile move into technology and markets following its acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Markit, the UK data provider. New global rules for banks and markets are expected to markedly change the way investors interact with each other and lead to more automation within trading, from execution of trades to back-office processing and data valuation.Virtu is one of a host of electronic traders using high-speed technology to make markets and buy and sell shares in assets in fractions of seconds. Their reliance on computer models was such that earlier this year it disclosed it had made only one daily trading loss in five years.“Temasek is an ideal partner for Virtu,” said Douglas Cifu, chief executive of Virtu. “Their extensive knowledge and relationships in Singapore, Asia and the Far East will be particularly beneficial as we look to expand into new asset classes and geographies.”Virtu is focusing on expanding beyond its mainstay of equities and currency trading into new areas. A planned listing in New York, with a valuation of about $3bn, was cancelled earlier this year in the wake of the furore caused by the publication of Flash Boys, a book by Michael Lewis which explored the high-speed world in which Virtu operates.A month ago Chris Concannon, one of its most high-profile executives, left to join BATS Global Markets, the second-largest US stock exchange by volume.
359;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-12-03T10:45:51Z;Eurozone recovery stutters in November;Purchasing managers’ survey at lowest level in 16 months, raising pressure for action to spur growth;The Eurozone’s recovery stuttered in November, with economic activity rising at the slowest pace in almost a year and a half, according to an influential poll of purchasing managers.The final purchasing managers’ index for the region, compiled by data firm Markit, fell to 51.1 last month from 52.1 in October. The figure, which is just above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity, is the lowest for 16 months and will raise pressure on officials to unveil fresh measures to boost growth.European Central Bank policy makers meet on Wednesday to discuss whether to extend its asset purchases, now limited to covered bonds and asset-backed securities, to include corporate or sovereign debt.While most ECB watchers do not expect a decision on either measure as soon as Thursday, more signs of a lacklustre recovery will raise expectations of action in the first quarter of next year.The PMIs pointed to anaemic demand, with most of the weakness in the recovery down to the poor performance of the dominant services industry. The reading for services fell to 51.1, from 52.3 last month. Services companies are much more reliant on eurozone consumers than manufacturers.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The survey results indicate that policy initiatives currently announced have yet to have a meaningful impact on business or consumer confidence in the region, and that more aggressive measures are likely to be needed, and quickly implemented, if another recession is to be averted.”The final figures for Germany and France, the currency area’s largest economies, were worse than first thought. The German PMI was 51.7, down from a flash estimate of 52.1 and the lowest for 17 months. Activity in France contracted at its fastest pace for nine months, its reading falling to 47.9, against a slightly higher flash estimate of 48.4.Price pressures remained weak, with input costs rising at their slowest pace since the spring and companies continuing to slash prices to boost competitiveness.Official data showed consumer inflation in the region fell back to 0.3 per cent last month, on a par with the five-year low recorded in September and well below the ECB’s target of just under 2 per cent.
360;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-11-14T11:11:27Z;UK construction bounces back;Fears of slowdown overcome as sector records 16th month of growth;Growth in the UK’s construction sector bounced back in September, easing fears that recent weaker data signalled a more substantial slowdown.Output was up 1.8 per cent on the month, and 3.5 per cent compared with last September, the 16th consecutive period of year-on-year monthly growth, the Office for National Statistics said.Economists are increasingly confident that the sharp drop recorded in August of 3.9 per cent, revised lower in this release to 3 per cent, was a statistical blip. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said that while the rebound was slightly lower than consensus expectations it was “still a strong bounce and revisions to the back data should temper any disappointment significantly.”“Some of the recent worries about UK prospects have probably been overdone,” he said, predicting just a mild slowdown.Chris Williamson, chief economist at data firm Markit, said the “partial recovery” in September, meant the sector recorded “healthy growth” for the third quarter as a whole.The CIPD/Markit construction purchasing managers’ surveys suggested growth would cool slightly in coming months, but added “at the moment, however, any slowing merely looks to be a moderation from historically higher rates of growth earlier in the year, and will pose little concern to policy makers.”Much of the growth continues to come from house building, with new housing at its highest monthly level since the series began in 2010.On Thursday, data from the department for communities and local government showed that the number of new homes in England had risen by 10 per cent over the past year, the highest percentage increase for 12 years.However, the levels still remain well below the pre-recession peak, with 136,610 net new homes added in 2013-14, compared with 223,530 in 2007-08.
361;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-11-06T11:29:49Z;Manufacturing shrugs off slowdown;Official figures show boost from domestic demand;UK manufacturing shrugged off fears of a sharp slowdown to record solid growth in September as the overall economic recovery continues – albeit at a slower pace.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research also estimated on Thursday that the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months ending in October, in line with the think-tank’s expectation that the economy would expand by 3 per cent for the year.After a run of softer than expected data, the set of solid industrial production figures offered reassurance that growth was still on track.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said there was no need for panic “it’s just that we are not booming any more”.Domestic demand helped manufacturing grow by 0.4 per cent month on month in September, the fourth consecutive increase, despite the deteriorating economic outlook in the eurozone, the sector’s main trading partner.Overall industrial production was up 0.6 per cent, as car plants came back online after a summer lull and production resumed at some of the big North Sea oilfields.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, said that, while expansion had slowed since the start of the year, “the picture is one of a mild rather than sharp slowdown, with the UK so far riding out weaker growth in the eurozone relatively well”.As expected, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee decided on Thursday to leave interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.5 per cent.Whereas only a few months ago, many in the City thought there was a chance the first move on rates could come this year, few are now pencilling in a rate rise before the general election in May.Next week, the BoE will update its growth and employment forecasts, which will be scrutinised to see how it is balancing what the conflicting signals of falling unemployment and weak wage growth mean in terms of remaining room for non-inflationary growth.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, pointed out that even Wednesday’s survey of activity in the service sector contained some ammunition for those seeking to raise rates because it contained indications that companies were starting to see escalating wage pressures forcing up costs.“This suggests that the MPC is likely to remain split into two distinct camps for the foreseeable future,” he said.Manufacturing still remains about 4 per cent below its pre-recession peak, and overall production 9.5 per cent below, indicating the sector has some way to go in its recovery, while the dominant service sector is now well above its pre-recession peak.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey data provider Markit, said the surveys and data suggested manufacturing had “shifted down a gear compared to earlier in the year”, but added overall the economy was still “growing at a fair clip, albeit with a darkened outlook compared to earlier in the year”.The Office for National Statistics also revised down its estimate for third-quarter growth for overall industrial production to 0.2 from 0.5 per cent, but said the change would have “minimal impact” on overall third-quarter GDP figures.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said that, while survey evidence suggested manufacturing would continue to grow in the final months of 2014, the fact that much of the good data are coming from sectors such as transport, food and chemicals adds “to the evidence that domestic demand is playing a big role in driving output growth”.Separate data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also showed a sharp pick up in new car sales, with registrations jumping 14.2 per cent in October to 179,714 units. This took the total number of cars relisted this year to more than 2m for the first time since 2007, as consumers increasingly have the confidence to make big purchases.
362;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-11-05T11:03:20Z;Services data fuel sense of UK slowdown;Services sector activity at its lowest level in 17 months but still reading above the 50 mark;Weakening activity in the vital service sector has reinforced the view that UK economic growth is slowing down.Sterling fell to a one-year low against the dollar on Wednesday as weaker than expected figures in a key survey boosted traders’ confidence that interest rates would remain on hold until next summer, and expectations rose that the US might be the first large economy to stage an increase.David Tinsley, UK economist at UBS, said the softening in the housing market, where mortgage approvals have been dropping, was also likely to weigh on growth.He noted that the Bank of England might well “edge down” its forecasts, but with the labour market remaining strong there was no cause for alarm. “To some extent a moderation in growth, particularly if it is housing-led, is not necessarily a bad thing,” he said. The unofficial Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey fell for the second consecutive month to its lowest level in 17 months. While still well above the 50 mark, which separates expansion from contraction, the index dropped more than expected to 56.2 in October from 58.7.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said it was clear the service sector was “coming off the boil” but that a reading in the “mid-50s territory is great, just not booming any more”.Taken together with the good manufacturing and weaker construction PMI surveys earlier in the week, Markit is predicting overall economic growth in the fourth quarter to slow to 0.5 per cent from 0.7 per cent in the third quarter.However, this would still mean the economy grew by 3 per cent this year, the fastest pace since 2006 and one of the best rates in the industrial world.Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the EY Item club, said the PMI surveys were suggesting a “gentle drift down” but with services activity still above the long-term average he was “surprised” by the extent Markit expected growth to weaken, suggesting 0.6 per cent or a little higher.Whereas only a few months ago a number of economists were predicting that the first interest rate move could come this autumn, they now unanimously expect them to stay at their current record low when the Bank of England makes its announcement on Thursday.The BoE will update its growth forecasts in next week’s inflation report. In August it was expecting a rate of 0.8 per cent in the fourth quarter but that is its prediction for the final vintage of the data, not the preliminary estimate, which the BoE believes is likely to be revised up.The minutes of the most recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting noted that a “slight loss of momentum” in monthly indicators and survey balances were “consistent” with its expectation that growth would slow gently.Markit also reports that average prices charged for goods and services fell, albeit only slightly, for the first time since July 2012, indicating that near-term inflationary pressures remain muted.This chimes with the British Retail Consortium’s monthly shop price index, also released on Wednesday, which reported prices on the high street falling by 1.9 per cent.George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said he expected the Bank of England to revise down its inflation forecasts for the near term but cautioned that it was those looking a few years ahead that “will be more important for policy”.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
364;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;UK construction sector hit by residential building slowdown;PMI shows 18th consecutive month of growth for industry as a whole;UK construction sector activity expanded at its weakest pace in October in five months due to a sharp slowdown in residential building growth but remained well above the long-term average, according to a new survey.The latest purchasing managers’ index from Markit/CIPS showed all three broad areas of construction activity recorded a slower rise in output compared with previous months. Residential building expanded at its slowest rate for 12 months. Commercial activity was the strongest subsector, while civil engineering was the weakest.The index registered 61.4 in October, down from 64.2 in September but higher than the long-term average of 54.5. Any reading above 50 is considered expansion. The October figure marks the 18th consecutive month of expansion, the longest continuous period of growth since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the October reading “provides the first indication that the chill winds blowing across the UK housing market have started to weigh on the booming residential building sector”.He said the sharp growth slowdown since the summer “reflects greater caution towards new development projects amid tighter mortgage lending conditions and renewed uncertainties about the demand outlook”.Despite the slowing trend, “ UK construction companies remain highly upbeat about their overall prospects for growth”, Mr Moore said. “Survey respondents cited a broad-based improvement in domestic economic conditions and rising investment spending patterns as key factors likely to support construction output over the year ahead.”The upbeat outlook was reflected in construction companies continuing to increase their staffing levels at “a sharp pace” in October albeit at a slower rate than in the previous five months. Markit said this reflected “strong pipelines of existing work and resilient confidence towards the business outlook”.Construction accounts for a little over 6 per cent of the UK economy, but is a very volatile sector in which booms and busts can have significant influences on the overall UK growth rate. Output remains significantly below 2010 levels and far below the peak in 2007.In a note, Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, focused on the continuing buoyant trend rather than the slowdown in growth, saying: “For the economy as a whole, strong domestic momentum seems to be offsetting the weaker demand from abroad evident in the manufacturing PMI for now.”“The drag from geopolitical tensions may be beginning to ease a little, or at least is not getting any worse,” Mr Wood added. “Consumer confidence remains strong while falling petrol and food prices, along with a reprieve on rate hikes for the next six months or so, should help domestic spending keep ploughing ahead.”David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the “euphoria of the last few months is settling down to a slightly more modest level of expansion”.He added that “delivery times continue to lengthen and suppliers of raw materials are in high demand, making the completion of construction projects more challenging and showing how the number of available suppliers has not yet reached pre-recession levels”.
365;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-11-03T09:50:02Z;Eurozone manufacturing recovery remains sluggish;Final PMI survey comes in just above crucial 50 reading marking an expansion;The eurozone’s manufacturing recovery remained sluggish in October, according to a closely watched poll of purchasing managers.The final purchasing managers’ index for the region’s factories was 50.6, slightly lower than the flash estimate of 50.7 and just above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.Of the countries included in the poll, Ireland performed best, registering a reading of 56.6. France, the region’s second-largest economy, was among the worst performers, though at 48.5 the final index was an improvement on a first estimate of 47.3.Manufacturing activity in Germany and Spain continued to grow at a moderate pace. But the reading for Italy fell to 49, its lowest level in almost a year and a half.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the index, said the figures indicated a sector that once led the region’s recovery was still struggling to pick up the traction lost during the middle of this year.“Manufacturing is unlikely to provide any meaningful boost to the currency union’s anaemic GDP growth,” Mr Dobson said. The region’s economy failed to grow at all between the first and second quarter. Figures for the third quarter are out later this month.The PMIs signalled price pressures could remain subdued in a region where consumer inflation is only 0.4 per cent. Input prices and output charges both declined last month, on the back of the fall in the price of oil and strong competition.Mr Dobson said the economic climate was “forcing firms to focus on cost-cutting and competitiveness, at the expense of employment and margins, as they strive to boost sales volumes.”
366;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-11-03T00:01:07Z;Questions remain as London’s low pay moves up political agenda;Big City names companies pledge to pay all their staff a living wage;Thirteen years ago, the living wage was a campaign slogan for a few struggling parents in low paid jobs in London’s East End. Fast-forward to today, and the list of companies signed up to the voluntary scheme reads like a Who’s Who of the City.Barclays, HSBC, PwC, KPMG, JPMorgan and Deloitte are just a handful of the big-names pledged to pay all their staff a wage calculated to allow a full-time employee an acceptable standard of living.And it will be a Conservative politician, London mayor Boris Johnson, who will on Monday announce the new London-specific wage in a sign of how the issue of low pay is no longer a cause simply of the left.The national rate will rise 2.6 per cent to £7.85 an hour, 21 per cent higher than the legally binding minimum wage. The London rate, which currently stands at £8.80, is expected to rise by a similar proportion, with accredited employers having six months to implement the increase.While employment numbers stand at near-record highs, wage growth remains exceptionally weak, fuelling the idea that not everyone has benefited from the recovery, as well as hitting the government’s deficit reduction plans due to lower income tax receipts.Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said that as the recovery continued it was vital that the proceeds of growth are properly shared.“It’s not enough to simply hope for the best,” he added, saying it would take “concerted action by employers, government and civil society” to raise wages.Labour has mooted the idea of requiring all government suppliers to guarantee they would pay the living wage to their employees as a condition of receiving contracts.But despite the campaign’s move into the political mainstream, nagging questions remain.While the number of employers signed up to the voluntary scheme has doubled in the past year to about 1,000, that is still just a tiny fraction of Britain’s estimated 4.9m businesses.New research from Markit Economics for KPMG has found that 5.28m people, or 22 per cent of the working population, earn less than the living wage.The Ritzy Picturehouse in fashionable Brixton is a world away from the soulless strip-lit, out of town cinema, writes Emily Cadman.Normally buzzing with affluent young urbanites, it has a well-regarded café and bar, hosts discussion nights and screens art house films and happily permits its patrons to take a glass of wine into a screening.Yet despite its right-on image, it has been at the centre of a bitter wage dispute that has seen figures such as author Will Self call for a boycott and shone a spotlight on the struggle to raise wages in the retail sector.Continue readingAnd two sectors in particular, where many of the low paid jobs in Britain are concentrated, are largely absent from the list of accredited companies: retail and hospitality.Ninety per cent of bar staff, 80 per cent of kitchen and catering assistants and 70 per cent of sales and retail assistants earn less than the living wage, according to the Markit calculations.Mike Kelly, head of living wage at KPMG, said that as the issue has been moving up the political agenda, attitudes among businesses had “shifted quite markedly”, with more and more interest at senior levels.In the past year, the number of FTSE 100 companies signing up to the scheme has risen from four to 18.Businesses contemplating introducing the living wage need to treat it as a “change management programme” and an opportunity to rethink roles, Mr Kelly said, giving the example of KPMG, where post room workers’ skills were expanded to include stationary management.“It is a much broader conversation than just fairness on salaries and wages, though that is still the core of it,” he said, adding “there is a huge amount of productivity and skills gain to factor in”.Some business groups have, however, injected a note of caution, expressing concerns that companies could feel coerced.Katja Hall, deputy director-general at the Confederation of British Industry, stressed that Britain already had an “effective, universal wage floor” in the national minimum wage “which enjoys strong support from the business community”.She added that while the living wage could be a useful guide for those businesses able to pay more, circumstances would vary. “Rather than requiring firms to introduce pay rises that many cannot afford, we must look at ways to raise living standards sustainably.”
367;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The European market data debate;Access and cost of trading data are a sensitive issue for European market participants;"Few topics in European exchanges stir the passions like price and access market data.Often a delicate subject, it’s particularly acute right now as everyone tries to find ways to economise and authorities finalise the rules of Mifid II.We’ve hosted a flavour of this debate here on FT Trading Room in recent months.There was an article from European Securities Exchanges, with a piece entitled: “Beware misconceptions over European market data” which warned that imposing cost controls carried high risk of a bad policy outcome.Presenting a contrary view were Mark Hemsley, chief executive of BATS Chi-X Europe; Richard Metcalfe, director of regulatory affairs at the Investment Management Association; Rudolf Siebel, managing director of BVI; and Helle Søby Thygesen, manager of capital markets at the Nordic Securities Association.We’ve received a response to both columns from Mark Schaedel at Markit, which we’ve published below. But we’re keen to hear more views on this topic so feel free to email me and we’ll publish some of the best.A couple of pointers: no long essays and keep your thoughts concise, respectful and clean. Same rules at the Letters to the Editor in the dead tree version apply. Email is: philip.stafford@ft.comFrom: Mr Mark SchaedelThe primary objective of Mifid II to restore market transparency is critical to the health of capital markets and should be supported unconditionally by all market participants.It has become clear that its predecessor, Mifid, has created significant unintended consequences. For example, some over-the-counter trades are reported twice or three times, while others are not reported at all. For certain instruments like exchange traded funds (ETFs) there is no OTC trade reporting requirement which has caused tremendous inefficiency and stunted growth in the ETF market.While it is easy to criticise exchanges for onerous market data fees, the reality is that their fees have little to do with the commercial model required to support a consolidated tape. The collective costs of Europe’s exchange market data (about €480 per month per user) are often cited in comparison to the US (about $100 per user), relying on a flawed comparison between the 50+ exchange feeds to the US Consolidated Tape System rather than the equivalent costs of the 14 US exchange feeds, which exceed $500 per user. These exchange feeds were neither priced nor designed for consolidation, making them unsuitable for comparison.A prerequisite for a successful solution is comprehensive cover of all European equity markets under a single, reasonable cost structure, which exists in the US. However we should tread carefully when it comes to tampering with the economics of our market structure. For any market, prices are arguably the core product – trade execution is really a means of creating them. Many equity markets have become a showroom for their prices, which are easily referenced by competing markets at no cost.In the US consolidated tape revenues are allocated on the basis of market share, which means the prices resulting from pegged trades are awarded the same revenue allocation as the originating price. These revenues are then used to fund rebates which are paid to attract orders away from incumbent markets, causing a deterioration in price quality. Rebates and other forms of payment for order flow are often cited as undermining the spirit of market competition. For this reason, US tape revenues have been recognised as powerful influences on market behaviour and have been embedded into regulation.Participation in the US tape model is limited to exchanges, which has had a significant influence on market innovation, as most would-be entrants face significant barriers to entry. Europe has the opportunity to adopt a thoughtful and modern approach for a consolidated tape.It could support innovation in its equity markets by making its tape revenue allocations more democratic and allowing any market or platform to participate. While this may seem counterintuitive, the reality is that it could avoid the risk and costs of a centralised monopoly.Adopting a carrot rather than a stick approach avoids having to rely on arbitrary limits on trading activities and the regulatory costs related to monitoring them. Placing a higher value on displayed orders, for example, compensates for the value they create and reflects the risks they incur as an alternative to dark pool caps and complex limit order protection rules.The scope of Mifid II has increased dramatically with noise clouding the purpose. Prioritising the fundamental issue of market transparency and filtering through the noise is the best way to avoid an outcome which leads calls for Mifid III.Mark Schaedel, Managing director and global head of equity & index data services, Markit, London"
368;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-23T12:03:30Z;Record outflows from Europe-focused ETFs;US investors have pulled nearly $3bn from US-listed European equity ETFs so far this month;"US investors’ retreat from Europe has accelerated this month, with the amounts they have pulled from European-focused equity exchange traded funds already exceeding the previous record set in August.Outflows so far this month from US-listed European equity ETFs have reached nearly $3bn, according to an analysis by Markit, the financial data provider. That compares with $2.2bn in August and was the largest in any month since such products were launched more than a decade ago.The flows were driven by the weaker euro, but they also highlight a global shift in sentiment away from Europe amid fears the continent could slip into a deflationary downswing. “The growth story isn’t really there,” said Simon Colvin, analyst at Markit.ETFs, which trade like stocks and often track baskets of securities, are used widely by hedge funds as well as retail investors as easy ways to take quick, directional positions on changing economic prospects. Outflows picked up from October 10, after a week of sharp falls in global share prices and continued during last week’s financial market turbulence.Encouraging US investors to repatriate funds have been transatlantic divergences in monetary policies that have led to the euro falling 9 per cent against the dollar since May. While the US Federal Reserve this month plans to end its quantitative easing, or large scale asset purchases, the European Central Bank is expanding its balance sheet via lending and private sector asset purchases.This month the International Monetary Fund warned of a 40 per cent chance of a eurozone recession, although purchasing managers’ indices released on Thursday suggested economic activity this month had been stronger than expected.News, commentary and analysis of the eurozone’s debt crisis and its faltering recovery as it struggles with austerity and attempts to regain competitiveness

Further readingThe UK, which is not part of the eurozone, has not been immune from the change in sentiment, with this month’s outflows from UK-focused ETFs approaching $700m, also a record.European equity funds have also seen global investors withdrawing in recent months. Last week saw record outflows of $5.7bn from European equity funds tracked by EPFR, the funds data provider.However, US investors have not given up on Europe when they can protect against the falling euro. Inflows into US-listed currency-hedged European exposed ETFs were $326m this month, which Markit said showed “investors are still keen to gain exposure to the eurozone”."
369;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-23T09:03:55Z;Eurozone business activity expands in October;Increase in October confounds market expectations;A closely watched survey of economic activity in the eurozone rose unexpectedly in October, though readings for price pressures and employment stirred concerns that the region could face another downturn.The flash purchasing managers’ index for the currency bloc, compiled by data firm Markit, showed momentum increased slightly, with the reading for October rising slightly to 52.2 from 52.While the figure beat economists’ expectations and remains above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity, sub-indices for output prices, jobs and new orders painted a gloomier picture.Concerns that the eurozone is facing an extended period of economic stagnation have risen in recent months, on the back of signs that the currency area’s recovery has all but petered out.The European Central Bank started to buy covered bonds this week as part of a package of measures which policy makers hope will bloat the monetary guardian’s balance sheet by up to €1tn. But in recent days investors have been pushing for policy makers to do more to pull the bloc from its economic rut.Berlin came under pressure at the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings in Washington DC this month to revive the region’s economy by raising spending and relaxing its position on the European Union’s tough budget rulesWorryingly for a region in which consumer inflation is already at a five-year low of 0.3 per cent, the survey of managers in eight countries reported a fall in output prices, with businesses squeezing their margins by cutting costs in the face of weak demand. The reading for output prices fell from 48.5 to 47.1, the lowest since 2010.Companies also employed slightly fewer people, with Markit recording the first sub-50 reading for the jobs market since November 2013.New business, an important bellwether of activity in the months ahead, improved at the slowest pace since orders began rising in August 2013.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the headline number of 52.2 masked the weaknesses of sub-indices “which show the region teetering on the verge of another downturn”.Mr Williamson added: “Growth is so anaemic that increasing numbers are being forced into laying off staff and slashing prices in an attempt to cut costs and boost sales through discounting.”Some economists were more upbeat, however.Christian Schulz, economist at Berenberg Economics, said: “The rough patch is not over, with many details in the PMI survey warranting caution. But the October PMIs confirm that temporary stagnation is much more likely than a serious recession.”
370;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-10T09:53:27Z;Fresh data add to signs of UK slowdown;Exports and builders struggle, but questions remain over statistics;Britain’s exports fell in August and the country’s builders also had a bad month, adding to signs of a slight slowdown in the UK recovery, though economists questioned the trustworthiness of the official construction statistics.The UK’s trade deficit narrowed from £3.1bn in July to £1.9bn in August, but the apparent improvement masked a fall in exports outweighed by a bigger drop in imports.Economists said the underlying trend looked bad for Britain’s ambitions to “rebalance” away from domestic demand by selling more abroad: export volumes declined by 3.7 per cent in the three months to August, while imports grew 1.1 per cent.Recent surveys of UK manufacturers have shown a sharp fall in export orders as growth falters in the eurozone, the UK’s biggest trading partner. On Thursday, chancellor George Osborne said the eurozone risked slipping back into crisis and warned that the UK economy could not be immune to its problems.Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the “dark clouds hanging over British exporters” were unlikely to clear for a while. But he added: “Thankfully, whilst an export-led recovery in the UK remains unattainable for now, domestic demand should be plenty strong enough to ensure that the recovery maintains a healthy degree of momentum over the next few years.”Surveys suggest the UK’s dominant services sector, which accounts for about four-fifths of the economy, continues to expand strongly.Yet official construction data released on Friday offered a gloomier signal on domestic demand. Output fell 3.9 per cent between July and August, the Office for National Statistics said, and was slightly lower than the same month a year ago. There were particularly sharp drops in infrastructure, private commercial buildings and private housebuilding.The construction data are notoriously volatile and often revised, however, and economists pointed out they did not tally with the latest Markit purchasing managers’ index of the sector – an unofficial survey that suggested construction was expanding at the fastest rate for 17 years.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said he thought the official data gave a “wholly inaccurate representation of the sector’s health, and that construction in fact continues to boom”. Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan, said he and his colleagues were having “a hard time coming up with very convincing reasons why construction output should be doing anything other than growing smartly at this stage of the business cycle”.But Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, pointed out that “whether we trust the numbers or not” they would affect the official gross domestic product data. Some economists have trimmed their forecasts for growth between the second and third quarters to 0.7 per cent, down from 0.9 per cent the quarter before, but still a healthy pace of growth.
371;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-07T14:01:21Z;UK manufacturing hit by eurozone slowdown;National Institute of Economic and Social Research says overall UK growth easing;Britain’s manufacturers are suffering a slowdown as the worsening eurozone economy hits demand for UK-made products.The weak manufacturing data add to signs of a slight easing in the pace of UK economic growth, although the country is still enjoying a faster recovery this year than any other country in the G7, as the International Monetary Fund highlighted on Tuesday.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research separately on Tuesday estimated the UK economy grew 0.7 per cent in the three months to the end of September, down from 0.8 per cent in the three months to the end of August. That would mean the economy was 3.1 per cent bigger than a year ago.The official data show manufacturing output rose just 0.1 per cent between July and August, in line with economists’ expectations, while total industrial production was flat.The figures were released just after news of the biggest drop in German industrial output in five years in August, which raised fears of a possible recession in Europe’s biggest economy.Manufacturing only accounts for about 10 per cent of the UK economy, but its strong performance until recently has helped to power the recovery.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said the “deteriorating picture of the manufacturing sector” should prompt Bank of England policy makers to “take a pause for thought” before considering higher interest rates.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said there were still signs of expansion in the sector “but the pace of growth has shifted down a gear going into the second half of this year, with the weak industrial indicators coming from Europe likely to be a factor in explaining away some of the slowdown”.The manufacturers faring best are those that make products for the domestic market, such as food and plastics. The UK is growing faster than any other advanced economy thanks to a revival in consumer spending and investment. However, exporters are suffering from the geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and their knock-on effects on the eurozone’s already weak economy.Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said Ukraine and Russia were of little direct importance to UK exporters. “But the manufacturing cycle is highly integrated across countries,” he explained. “That means the decline in business confidence and German manufacturing output triggered by Russia’s aggression in Eastern Ukraine will continue to spread to the UK over the second half of the year.”Taking into account revisions to previous data, the level of industrial production in the first two months of the third quarter is about 0.2 per cent higher than the average level in the second.Economists at RBC Capital Markets said this was lower than they had been expecting and posed a “downside risk” to their forecast the economy would grow 0.7 per cent this quarter. But they added there was still healthy momentum in the construction and services sectors.
372;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-06T16:55:21Z;Financial crisis overhaul for credit swaps;;The credit derivatives market was adjusting on Monday to its biggest overhaul in more than a decade following the introduction of new definitions to incorporate events from the financial crisis.More than 1,400 institutional investors, hedge funds and banks have signed up to the provisions for credit default swaps (CDS), which were developed by banks, market infrastructure operators and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda).The move is the first update to Isda’s documentation, which provides the legal basis for most of the world’s credit derivatives transactions, since 2003.CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness.However, some junior bondholders complained that they were not paid out in full during some high-profile debt crises.The government invoked a “voluntary” debt exchange during the Greek debt crisis, which did not trigger a credit event under Isda’s rules, and meant not all bondholders were not paid out.Market participants were also initially confused when the Dutch government expropriated subordinated bonds for SNS Bank last year.“It’s actually massive but because it’s taken so long, people have forgotten a bit – it’s the first update we’ve had in that will include everything that’s happened in the last 11 years,” said Edmund Parker, partner and global co-head derivatives & structured products at Mayer Brown, a law firm.“It’s a really positive update and it’s much more objective. The downside is that it’s hugely more complex. With greater objectivity comes the cost of less understanding,” he added.Isda’s updated definitions were developed with 15 of the world’s largest banks, indices administrator Markit as well as clearing houses operated by Intercontinental Exchange and LCH.Clearnet.Updated definitions bring new provisions covering defaults into older trades.They include capturing government-led bail-ins, where investors are required by authorities to rescuing a bank.It also stipulates new definitions for restructuring sovereign debts that includes debt issued by third parties into which sovereign debt can be converted.The move affects both indices and single name credit default swaps. It also expands the iTraxx indices administered by UK data provider Markit.The iTraxx Crossover index – often used as a bellwether for European high-yield CDS – was enlarged by 15 names to 75.Consequently, the new benchmark is at 336 basis points compared with last week’s previous series close of 245 basis points.Investors to both sides of a trade will automatically have their contracts upgraded.

373;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-06T10:15:45Z;Markit steps up push into electronic communications;UK technology group to release software to allow banks to manage trader instant messaging;Markit is stepping up its push into electronic communications with a system that would give banks greater control over which employees can access their existing electronic chat rooms.Over the weekend the UK technology group is set to release new software that will allow banks to host and manage their traders’ access to instant message chat rooms. Six banks are already testing the new system.The move comes as banks and data providers grapple over the future of electronic messaging, which has become the principal way for participants in markets to swap trading information and gossip.Regulators have used trails of incriminating messages as the cornerstone for their investigations into alleged manipulation of a series of markets and benchmarks.Banks have clamped down on traders’ favourite communication tools after chat rooms have played a central role in global regulatory investigations into the alleged manipulation of Libor interbank lending and foreign exchange benchmark rates.Banks including Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS have in the past two years banned the use of multi-bank chat rooms, in which traders used to talk to their counterparts at other finance houses. They have also spent more energy on real-timing monitoring of those in-house and client chat rooms that continue to exist.Andrew Eisen, head of collaboration services at Markit, said that banning the use of chat rooms was not the answer. “Much of what you do is in real-time instant messaging. It doesn’t work in email. Phone doesn’t scale. There is no alternative,” he said. “Instead of all these disparate pieces overlapping, we provide a framework that can manage the risk.”Markit’s push also comes amid rising competition over control of instant communications as market participants seek to pressure Bloomberg, the US financial data provider, whose distinctive, secure but expensive black terminals dominate chat around the world’s financial markets.The $2,000 a month per terminal Bloomberg charges has enabled it to build a strong position in fixed income trading. However, banks have complained about the cost of the terminal. Relations with Wall Street were also strained by the so-called “ spying scandal” last year, when Bloomberg reporters were accused of using the terminals to monitor bankers.“It’s not about monetising chat. It’s about monetising the applications, what happens after the chat, that you want to tie chat to,” said Mr Eisen. “It’s not the message, it’s what you do with the message.”Last week, Goldman Sachs and 13 other Wall Street banks unveiled a new chat platform, known as Symphony Communication Services, which was born out of its purchase of Perzo, a Palo Alto-based technology start-up. The Symphony project may be expanded to develop trading functions and other features.Markit itself has created a system that allows users to connect different messaging functions. More than 220,000 people are now on the network.Additional reporting by Daniel Schäferwww.ft.com/tradingroom
374;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-01T17:38:24Z;Utilities gain as eurozone fears damp tech;S&P 500 slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors;US investors postured defensively on Wednesday following the weakest reading of eurozone manufacturing in more than a year.Activity was weighed down by a stagnation in German manufacturing in September as well as an unexpected dip in British manufacturing during the month, adding to concerns that a weakening Europe could weigh on S&P 500 earnings.Overall, the closely watched Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI index fell to a 14-month low of 50.3. Conversely, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a moderation in activity in the US, although it remained above the trailing 12-month average and indicated the 16th consecutive month of expansion.“The global readings on the manufacturing sector fall into three camps. Activity is humming in North America, stalled in Europe and most of Asia, and dreary with minor declines in most of the rest of the world,” Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, said.Companies on the benchmark US index, which generate 46 per cent of sales abroad, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors.Utilities, which are less exposed to currency movements and earn a far lower portion of revenues abroad, advanced.Since the year’s start, utilities have been among the best performing sectors on the S&P 500 – rising 11 per cent, trailing only the 14 per cent gain by the healthcare industry.Shares of Exelon advanced 1 per cent to $34.57, NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $31.19, Entergy rose 1 per cent to $78.04 and Southern Company increased 1 per cent to $44.09.Shares of pharmaceutical companies with potential treatments for the deadly Ebola virus rallied after the Centres for Disease and Control confirmed that the first case of Ebola had been diagnosed in the US on Tuesday.Shares of Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals surged 18 per cent to $24.99, while NewLink Genetics, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last month to proceed with clinical trials of its Ebola vaccine, advanced 7 per cent to $22.95.Lakeland Industries, the maker of protective suits to combat Ebola in west Africa, climbed 30 per cent to $9.01.Shares of fee-based consumer review site Angie’s List, surged 19 per cent to $7.59 after the FT reported that it hired bankers to review strategic options including a possible sale.Angie’s List executives are not tied to the sale, people familiar with the matter said. The stock remains 50 per cent lower this year to date.America’s biggest automaker, General Motors, rose after it unveiled plans to double profit margins to 9 to 10 per cent as measured by earnings before interest and tax adjusted for special items.The Detroit-based automaker also reported that September vehicle sales rose 19 per cent from a year ago. Shares of GM climbed 2 per cent to $32.49.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,946.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 16,804.71. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 4,422.08.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
375;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-01T09:32:40Z;Manufacturing recovery in the eurozone slows;Weak data pile pressure on ECB to take action;The eurozone’s manufacturing recovery faded last month, adding to signs that economic growth in the region in the third quarter will be meagre.The closely-watched manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slipped to a 14-month low of 50.3 in September, just above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity and slightly less than the flash estimate of 50.5.The deceleration means the average PMI for the third quarter was the lowest since the same quarter of last year. Markit, the data firm which compiles the PMIs, said businesses were cutting their prices in an attempt to boost sales and reported that prices fell across the region for the first time in over a year. The euro dipped 0.3 per cent versus the US dollar at the news, to a fresh two-year low of $1.2592Indications that the eurozone recovery is stuttering will raise pressure on the European Central Bank to take more action to counter threats to growth. Policy makers will travel to Naples this week, where ECB president Mario Draghi will unveil details of the central bank’s plan to buy private-sector assets.The sub-index for factories in Germany slipped below 50 to 49.9, indicating the crisis in Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia are weighing on activity in the eurozone’s largest economy.“With the conflict in Ukraine now frozen, confidence could stabilise soon, helped in particular by the 10 per cent depreciation of the euro against major trading partners’ currencies since early May,” said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg. “However, the continuing fall in sentiment in Germany suggests a risk to our call for confidence to stabilise as early as October.”The reading for the region’s second-largest economy, France, remained in negative territory, falling to a four-month low of 48.8. Greek and Austrian PMIs both fell below 50.The periphery’s largest economies performed better, with Spanish and Italian readings both above 50. Spain’s PMI rose to a seven-month high of 52.6, while the Italian reading was 50.7.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the index made for “gloomy reading”.“The euro area’s manufacturing economy has lost the momentum seen earlier in the year, lurching closer towards stagnation,” Mr Williamson said. “The near-term outlook also looks worrying.” New orders fell at the quickest pace for two years, suggesting activity could wane in the months ahead.
376;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-10-01T09:15:17Z;UK manufacturing activity slows to 17-month low;PMI data suggest rapid cooling of expansion;Activity among Britain’s manufacturers slowed to its lowest level in 17 months in September, suggesting a rapid cooling of expansion in the sector, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published on Wednesday by the consultancy Markit.The figures, which were weaker than expected, showed manufacturers reporting output growth and new orders no higher than the long-run average. The employment component of the index, however, remained strong.The index, which has tracked the official manufacturing output figures in recent months, suggests that the revival in the manufacturing sector, accounting for roughly 10 per cent of Britain’s economy, will be relatively shortlived.Although the economy is now 2.7 per cent larger than at the 2008 peak, manufacturing output still languishes 4.5 per cent below its pre-crisis peak.The Markit manufacturing PMI index dropped from 52.2 in August to 51.6 in September, having been as high as 57 as recently as April this year. The long-run average of the series is 51.5, indicating manufacturing activity and growth is close to its long-run trend, suggesting little growth as the sector has declined in importance for the UK economy.“The strong upsurge in UK manufacturing sector at the start of the year appears to have run its course,” said Rob Dobson of Markit. He predicted that the 0.5 per cent manufacturing output growth in the second quarter was “likely to creep closer to the stagnation mark in the third quarter”.The overall activity index was pulled lower by companies reporting weaker increases in production, new business and new export orders, dragged lower by geopolitical concerns and September’s Scottish referendum.James Knightley of ING said these considerations were likely to have affected manufacturing orders and any firm conclusions about Britain’s manufacturing would need to wait until the October figures.“One possibility is that the uncertainty generated by the close polls in the lead-up to the Scottish independence referendum made business cautious and therefore led to a delay in orders,” he said.Despite the weakness in the survey, many economists do not think it marks the end of the UK’s recent economic upswing. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics said: “The high level of consumer confidence and survey measures of firms’ investment intentions suggest that the domestic recovery should be strong enough to support modest growth in manufacturing output over the next year or so.”While the Bank of England and the government will not be too concerned by the recent downward trend in manufacturing, any sign that weakness is spreading to the service sector and hard data from official sources will give the central bank more reasons not to start to raise interest rates.
377;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK construction output in July at slowest pace since November;;Growth in the UK construction industry slowed over the summer to its slowest pace since last November, damping hopes the sector will make a meaningful contribution to overall economic growth this quarter.Output in July was up 2.6 per cent on a year ago, and flat compared with the previous month.The softer than expected official data run counter to private sector surveys that show a booming industry, with the latest Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ survey of activity hitting a seven-month high, driven by the resurgent housing market.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey data company Markit, said the picture from the official data of an industry “struggling as a whole to eke out any growth whatsoever” was “odd” considering the strength of the rest of the economy.He also pointed to the ONS’s new orders metric, which showed strong growth in private industrial and commercial work, adding the “signals from the survey and order book data therefore suggest the construction industry has fared better than the official output data would have us believe over the summer, and that upward revisions to the output data are possible.”Construction, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the economy, made no contribution to overall gross domestic product growth in the second quarter of the year, disappointing those hoping for evidence of rebalancing.The Office for National Statistics warned that monthly data can be volatile and that despite the subdued July numbers there is a “largely positive picture” of construction growth over the past year.Residential construction has largely been responsible for the growth in construction over the past year, with new housing starts in the second quarter of the year 18 per cent higher than in 2013. Other areas, such as infrastructure, have been fairly constant.Stefan Friedhoff, managing director for construction at Lloyds commercial banking, said the sector would take this data “with a pinch of salt”, particularly considering the optimistic picture painted by surveys.“As always, the reality is somewhere in between,” he said. “There is undoubtedly a buoyancy in the industry rarely seen since the recession but some factors are concerning. Demand is increasing but contractors are having to contend with cost inflation, labour shortages and a relentless pressure on their supply chains.”
378;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK borrowing costs shrug off Scottish challenge;;The swing towards Scottish independence in some opinion polls has sparked stories of investors pulling their cash from potentially affected assets and hurried calculations about how high the UK’s debt burden might go if an independent Scotland eschews its share of national debt. So why are UK government bonds, or gilts, not showing more signs of a sell-off?Although the pound fell to a 10-month low against the US dollar on Monday, UK government borrowing costs remain far lower than they were at the start of the year and the cost of insuring UK debt against default has remained largely unchanged over the past month, according to data group Markit.It seems particularly strange given stories that prices for Spanish government bonds are plunging on fears that Scottish independence might boost an independence movement in Catalonia.However, with the UK’s outstanding stock of gilts at a record high of more than £1tn and foreign investors already net sellers of gilts this year, analysts say the UK cannot yet write off the prospect of higher borrowing costs as a result of the referendum.What has been happening to gilts?Up until this week, investors in gilts appeared largely unfazed by the chatter around Scottish independence.With the publication of a poll at the weekend showing nationalist campaigners in the lead, things changed.When bond prices fall, yields rise, and the yield on the UK’s benchmark 10-year bonds has increased from 2.37 per cent at the end of August to 2.5 per cent today.At the shorter end of the bond market there has also been change – although things are moving the other way.Prices rose for two-year gilts, pushing down the yield from 0.86 per cent at the end of last week to 0.77 per cent on Monday. Bankers say this is because short-term government bond yields tend to be more affected by interest rate expectations, reflecting the idea that Scottish independence could leave the Bank of England less willing to raise interest rates in the near future.However, these movements need to be put into context. Ten-year gilt yields are no higher than they were at the beginning of August. According to one analyst, the changes are not particularly unusual for any given week.Why have UK borrowing costs not increased more?You cannot think about UK government bond prices without considering what is happening to other government borrowing costs. The long period of low interest rates resulting from the financial crisis have sent yields falling across the US, Europe and emerging markets in recent years.Some say the UK gilt market has enjoyed a near 30-year rally, dating back to the 1980s when yields were more than 12 per cent.Expectations that the Bank of England might be the first major central bank to raise interest rates post-crisis had led some investors to expect the rally to come to an end this year, yet prices have kept on rising and yields falling.The yield on benchmark 10-year gilts may have increased in the past two days but it started the year at more than 3 per cent and is now at 2.5 per cent.Scotland is one of a number of factors that gilt investors bear in mind, said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets. Geopolitical tension, broader economic data in the UK, the plans for the US to curb its bond-buying programme and the lack of inflation in the EU are all being taken into consideration right now.Another reason gilts may be moving at a slower pace than sterling is that debt and currency can attract investors with different priorities. More than a quarter of gilts are held by the Bank of England and a further quarter by pension funds and insurance companies, who invest for the long term. By contrast, currency investors are reacting more to short-term expectations of interest rate movements.What might happen if Scotland votes Yes?Expectations fall broadly into two camps. On one side are those who think the UK’s position as a borrower will be damaged by the loss of Scotland and that markets will react badly to the uncertainty. They believe investors will demand greater compensations for the perceived risks of holding UK debt and that yields will rise.On the other side are those who say the subsequent economic uncertainty of a Yes victory will push back the Bank of England’s plans to raise interest rates, and so keep gilt yields down.Any dip in business confidence and volatility in the equity markets could also benefit gilt investors, says Justin Knight, head of European rates strategy at UBS. Turbulence in equity markets in particular could encourage a flight to the safety of government bonds, helping to keep prices up and yields down.And there is comfort to be gained from the fact that the Treasury has said it will honour UK sovereign bonds no matter what happens, and that even if Scotland does refuse to take a share of national debt the increase in the UK’s net debt to GDP ratio (estimated to increase from 89 per cent to almost 100 per cent) will remain lower than those of other European countries, which are borrowing at sub-2.5 per cent rates.What if there is a No vote?If Scotland votes No then the Bank of England may well be the first major central bank to raise interest rates, as has been widely predicted in the past. Fixed-income analysts say UK gilts have already decoupled from European government bonds, which are being driven by the expectation that the European Central Bank will have to keep interest rates low and might start a programme of quantitative easing in the face of poor economic growth.However, if the vote is narrow it could slow down the rate hike cycle, depending on the broader economic environment, and this may keep the UK’s borrowing costs down. There is also the possibility that investors might be concerned that the issue of Scottish independence will be revisited in the future and that this uncertainty could create volatility in the gilt market.
379;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-09-04T14:16:15Z;Economists react to ECB rate cut;;The European Central Bank has gone further than was expected in its attempt to counter the threat of stagnation across the eurozone. Here are the initial reactions from five economists:Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit:“There are big questions over the effectiveness of the further reduction in interest rates and, while the asset purchases may have a more significant impact, little is known about just how many assets the ECB will be able to buy and what impact this will have on the economy.Perhaps the main immediate benefit of the additional policy action is a weakening of the exchange rate (the euro dropped around 1 per cent on the news and is down 5 per cent since the start of July). The lower exchange rate will undoubtedly provide a boost to exporters’ competitiveness.The action should also help improve business and consumer confidence. The more determined and aggressive approach from the ECB should hopefully encourage more investment and spending.There are suspicions that the increasingly aggressive stance from the ECB could reduce the likelihood of the central bank buying sovereign debt, a policy which is politically controversial but widely considered as becoming increasingly essential in reviving the economy.”Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes:“Today’s ECB moves are a step in the right direction, but too little, too late to snuff out deflation-risk and kick-start growth. The further 10bp shavings off the refinancing and deposit rates are puny, and look more cosmetic than real. Any drop in the euro on the back of them would be welcome, but possibly shortlived.The ECB hopes the negative deposit rate (-0.2 per cent) will deter banks from parking cash at the ECB, instead passing it on to consumers and firms. But, this may be a red herring, given still tame credit demand, pressure for the banks to pass stress tests and the fact that the bulk of reserves still gets the (0.05 per cent) refinancing rate.”Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist, at IHS Global Insight:“The ECB’s hand has clearly been forced by a further fall in eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.3 per cent in August, weakening inflation expectations and evidence that already weak eurozone economic activity was faltering. Eurozone GDP was only stagnant in the second quarter, consumer and business confidence relapsed to an 8-month low in August and the purchasing managers reported reduced manufacturing and services growth overall in AugustIt is also likely that the ECB’s moves are a reflection of further downward revisions to eurozone GDP growth and inflation forecasts in the September projections by ECB staff.”Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody’s Analytics:“The interest rate will remain at a record low for an extended period because of the stuttering recovery, high unemployment and weak inflation, which reached a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in August.With actual output below potential, low capacity utilisation in many eurozone countries, and low energy and food prices, the risk of deflation is intensifying. The output gap should close, at which point inflation should stabilise in late 2015 or early 2016. Until then, domestic inflation pressures will be soft.The risk of deflation and an anaemic eurozone recovery may prompt the ECB to introduce an additional monetary stimulus, such as full-scale quantitative easing, in coming months.Yet we do not expect the ECB to begin purchasing private and public debt until the bank evaluates its latest long-term lending programme targeted at boosting business credit.Meanwhile, bank lending has started to stabilise, easing pressure on the ECB to introduce further measures.”Nick Beecroft, a senior market analyst at Saxo Capital Markets:“ECB goes for ABS purchase of simple and transparent loans to non-financial corporations and also of covered bonds. QE-lite!”
380;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-09-03T09:12:02Z;Eurozone services recovery falters;;The recovery in the eurozone’s dominant services industry faltered slightly in August, highlighting the precariousness of the economy’s return to full health.The purchasing managers’ index for the services industry, compiled by data company Markit, dipped to 53.1 from 54.2 in July, though it remains well above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.The composite PMI, which combines readings for services and manufacturing, fell to 52.8 from 53.8, weighed down by stuttering growth in the region’s factories.Both the services and composite PMIs were slightly lower than flash estimates from late last month.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the figures would heighten pressure on the European Central Bank to act at Thursday’s monetary policy meeting.“The eurozone economy is defying expectations of gaining momentum, which will no doubt add to calls for the ECB to embark on full-scale quantitative easing,” Mr Williamson said.However, Mr Williamson added that sub indices for individual countries would encourage the ECB president Mario Draghi to strengthen his calls for economic reform. In Spain, which has undergone a major structural revamp, companies saw activity rise at its fastest pace since December 2006, with its PMI rising from 56.2 to 58.1.Readings for economies such as France and Italy, which the ECB has urged to pursue a stronger reform agenda, were poor.“The PMI data add to the view that, in the absence of governments taking tough measures to boost competitiveness and productivity, economic performance will remain disappointing even with further ECB action,” Mr Williamson said.The reading for France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, remained marginally in positive territory at 50.3, down only slightly from the July reading of 50.4. But the French figure was significantly lower than the flash estimate of 51.1, underlining the difficulties facing President François Hollande’s government in spurring growth and meeting budget targets set by Brussels.“This absence of economic recovery is a challenge for the budgetary policy, not only this year, but also in the future,” said Dominique Barbet, economist at BNP Paribas. “This also makes structural reforms more difficult to implement, in a political environment which is already very complicated.”In Italy, the level of business activity dropped slightly, with the PMI reading falling from an expansionary level of 52.8 in July to 49.8. It was the first reading below 50 since March, highlighting the weakness in an economy which in the second quarter fell into its third recession since the crisis began.
381;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-09-01T17:56:59Z;Factory go-slow increases pressure on ECB;;"The European Central Bank is facing renewed pressure to take radical steps to boost the eurozone’s flagging economy after activity in the region’s manufacturing sector all but petered out, raising the threat of a prolonged period of stagnation.Eurozone factories, which account for around a fifth of all output in the region, slowed to a virtual standstill in August in another sign that weak demand and geopolitical tensions are hurting the economy.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, released on Monday by data group Markit, dipped to a 13-month low of 50.7 in August. That was just above the 50 level that marks an expansion and well below the level needed to tackle stubbornly high unemployment.The weak data will embolden those calling on the ECB’s governing council to vote for fresh measures to tackle the eurozone’s stuttering economy and persistently low inflation when it meets on Thursday.Last month, Mario Draghi, ECB president, acknowledged markets had less confidence in the ECB’s ability to return inflation to its target, removing one of the main impediments to further monetary easing.Outright purchases of bundles of repackaged loans, known as asset-backed securities, are seen by some analysts as the ECB’s most likely move.“We have long expected ABS purchases will occur. The question is whether the ECB will be ready to present a detailed programme,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank. “If the ECB wants to send a signal, it will probably generally announce an ABS programme but refer to a later date with regards to the details and start of the programme.”However, some economists believe that hopes for a large-scale bond buying programme, known as quantitative easing, will probably be dashed.“[Mario Draghi] has backed himself into a corner; he can’t turn around and do nothing,” said Lorcan Roche Kelly, of Agenda Research, an investment advisory firm. “But he’s not going to announce QE.”Mr Roche Kelly added: “By now, the market should be used to the ECB going far too slowly for their tastes.”The ECB will unveil a fresh set of economic forecasts following Thursday’s vote, with its current expectations of growth of 1 per cent and inflation of 0.7 per cent this year now looking optimistic.The eurozone’s recovery ground to a halt in the second quarter and inflation fell to 0.3 per cent in August, less than a fifth of the central bank’s target of just below 2 per cent.Lucrezia Reichlin, co-founder of Now-Casting, a forecaster that tracks economies in real time, and a professor at the London Business School, said the eurozone’s recovery had weakened since the spring. “There is geopolitical risk. But China is also slowing down and the fiscal and monetary stance in the eurozone has been very restrictive,” Ms Reichlin said..Markit blamed economic and geopolitical tensions for slower demand, with the rate of expansion of new orders falling to its lowest level in more than a year.“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.“This is also the case on the demand front, with growth of new orders and new export business both slowing in August.”"
382;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-25T16:20:55Z;Wickr butts into conversation on Wall St chatroom;;Wickr, a cyber security start-up, is in talks with banks and major financial services companies including Markit to create an alternative to Bloomberg instant messaging, just as Goldman Sachs tries to create its own Wall Street chat service.The San Francisco-based company has taken an investment from CME Group, the futures exchange operator, and is working closely with it to create an app that will allow both chat and financial transactions between traders.The app would undercut Bloomberg while creating a more secure service which automatically deletes messages that regulators no longer require financial services to keep, removing the risk of storing information for longer than is necessary.Nico Sell, Wickr chief executive, said the company wanted to be the “cheapest and the best” for messaging, using encrypted peer-to-peer communications which means Wickr never has access to the content of the emails or chats.She said the financial services industry could not trust the big technology companies to create a messaging service because their business is data.“You do not see Google or Facebook building systems this way because it is not in their interest. They are sitting on databases that they are legally obliged to sell to create value for shareholders,” she said.Wickr would not say which banks it was in talks with, although it did say it was talking to Markit, the financial information service.Its negotiations come at the same time as Goldman Sachs has asked financial companies across Wall Street to invest $5m to $6m each to create another alternative to Bloomberg’s instant messaging, which relies on the $20,000 a year terminals.That project is believed to involve fusing Goldman’s own in-house messaging technology, known as Live Current, with software developed by another California-based start-up, Perzo.Wickr has hired Andrew Caspersen, former chief information security officer at Charles Schwab, to head its financial services unit.“A lot of people think Bloomberg is just too expensive,” he said. But he said the current alternatives, using consumer services such as iMessage or email – were “hard to control”.Wickr can be used to send messages that self destruct, in a similar way to Snapchat, but for bankers the limit would be set to regulatory requirements, keeping the messages for seven years in the US. Many never delete messages, creating a store of information that could be very enticing to a cyber criminal or a disgruntled employee, who could publish them online or use it to blackmail executives.“The next wave of significant data breaches could be with archives of messages,” Mr Caspersen said.He said Wickr could also create closed groups better than Bloomberg, for example, a chatroom only for chief financial officers at 10 firms.Wickr’s list of investors include Michele Burns, who is on the board of directors for Goldman Sachs, Gilman Louie, the founder and former chief executive of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s strategic venture fund, and Jim Breyer, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist best known for his early investment in Facebook.
383;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-21T18:05:15Z;Eurozone government borrowing costs hit record lows;;Eurozone government borrowing costs sank to historic lows on Thursday as investors increased bets that the European Central Bank would take aggressive action to avert a deflationary slump, following early data indicating that the region’s recovery slowed in August.The “flash” purchasing managers’ index for the currency bloc fell from 53.8 in July to 52.8, Markit said, amid signs that geopolitical tensions were hurting sentiment among eurozone manufacturers. While the figure is above the crucial 50 mark, which signals an expansion in activity, momentum appears too subdued to create jobs in a region where unemployment is in double digits.The PMI data “fit with the story of weak growth and low inflation, which make it more likely that the ECB will have to act”, said Alessandro Tentori, head of rates strategy at Citigroup.Amid calls for the ECB to start quantitative easing to rid the region of the threat of stagnation, president Mario Draghi will on Friday speak at the central bankers’ Jackson Hole summit in the US.Any ECB action to start QE could lead to eurozone government bonds being bought on a large scale.Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds, which move inversely to prices, fell to a euro-era low of 2.37 per cent while Italy’s were scarcely higher than their record low at 2.59 per cent. Portuguese yields fell to a near-decade low of 3.22 per cent – despite fears about weaknesses in its banking system triggered by last month’s crisis over Banco Espírito Santo, the country’s largest listed lender.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the region was on course for growth of 0.3-0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a level “unlikely to stimulate any real turnround in the labour market”.The fall in PMI follows weak gross domestic product figures for the eurozone last week, with the recovery slamming on its brakes in the second quarter. Data suggested its factories were no longer powering the recovery, with the PMI manufacturing reading falling to 50.8.“This survey will add to pressure on the ECB to do more to support the flagging eurozone economy, even while other major central banks start to move in the opposite direction,” said Jennifer McKeown, economist at Capital Economics.
384;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US investors cut their European exposure;;US investors scaled back significantly their exposure to Europe as the continent’s economic prospects waned and tensions escalated over Ukraine, according to data on exchange traded funds.US-listed ETFs exposed to Europe including the UK have seen net outflows of almost $4bn in the past six weeks, reported Markit, the financial data company.Taking into account price changes, assets under management had fallen to $127.5bn, from $136bn on June 30.The outflows highlighted a sharp shift in global investor sentiment towards Europe.There were strong inflows into European bonds and equities at the start of the year as economic data improved and the eurozone returned to stability after its debt crisis years.Europe also benefited from turmoil in emerging markets. In the first six months of 2014, the bond and equity ETFs covered by Markit’s report had inflows of $19.3bn.ETFs, which trade like stocks and often track baskets of securities, are used widely by hedge funds as well as retail investors as easy ways to take quick, directional positions on changing global economic prospects.The US investor outflows “started as a trickle in the opening weeks of July and only gathered momentum in the first week of August when over $1.4bn of assets flew out of funds exposed to the region,” said Simon Colvin, Markit analyst, in a research note.“The possible causes for this capital flight may range from the fact that Europe stands to lose more from further Russian sanctions, anaemic European growth and the strengthening dollar.“The only certainty is that a growing portion of American investors think that their assets are better invested outside of Europe, something which wasn’t the case six weeks ago,” he added.Similar trends are shown in data on European equity funds tracked by EPFR, the funds data provider, which last week saw the highest level of redemptions in more than two years.European share prices dropped sharply in July and early August, with Germany’s Xetra Dax index falling by as much as 10 per cent – the usual definition of a market correction – before rallying.Weak eurozone growth data last week, showing the region stagnating in the second quarter, and low eurozone inflation have fuelled speculation that the European Central Bank will be forced into “quantitative easing”, or the large-scale asset purchases seen in the US and UK in recent years.German 10-year government bond yields last week fell below 1 per cent on worries about Ukraine but also QE talk.Worst affected by ETF outflows were “core” continental European economies such as Germany, France as well as Sweden.In contrast, Italy and Spain continued to appeal to US investors, according to Markit.A possible explanation is that US investors remaining in Europe were looking for countries with the greatest turnround potential.As US investors scaled back investments in Europe, however, domestic investors have taken up the slack.Locally listed exchange traded products with European exposures have continued to grow their asset base over the summer, Markit said.
385;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-13T22:04:48Z;Markit beats revenue and earnings estimates with maiden results;;Markit, the UK financial data and service provider that listed in New York in June, beat expectations for revenue and earnings in its debut report as a public company.In the second quarter, revenue rose 11 per cent year over year to $265m, with growth in all three of its business lines: information, processing and solutions. Wall Street consensus had estimated $256m of revenue. Recurring fixed revenue as a percentage of the total increased from 49.9 per cent to 50.8 per cent.Adjusted earnings, stripping out extraordinary costs associated with the IPO, fell to 37 cents a share from 41 cents a year ago, amid a favourable tax adjustment in the year ago period and a higher share count in this one due to the IPO. Operating expenses rose 14 per cent.“Notwithstanding the continuing challenges in the financial markets, particularly in fixed income, we remain well positioned to deliver on our long-term financial objectives of organic revenue growth of 5 per cent to 7 per cent, overall double digit revenue growth including acquisitions and adjusted ebitda margin in the low to mid 40s,” said Lance Uggla, chairman and chief executive.Markit has faced concerns about growth for its processing business – through which it offers back office services primarily for fixed income trading – as regulation drives certain rates and derivatives trading to electronic platforms called swap executive facilities, or Sefs. The processing segment accounts for about a quarter of Markit’s revenue.“Markit will still have a role to play, but electronic trading presents a headwind,” said Manav Patnaik, an analyst at Barclays. “They probably won’t be able to charge as much for their services because the electronic exchange will take care of some of them.”The effect of electronic trading has yet to play out, however, since the move to Sef trading has take longer than expected.Revenue in Markit’s processing business rose about 2 per cent to $72m. Markit said the results reflected a small decline in revenue in its derivatives processing product, offset by favourable foreign exchange movements.Proceeds from the nearly $1.5bn IPO went to Markit’s investors, largely a consortium of big investment banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, but the deal gives the acquisitive company a new currency.Mr Uggla told a conference call with analysts that the company was always looking for potential acquisitions, but added that assets “seem to be expensive” and that there were no “bargains”.Shares of Markit fell about 3 per cent to $25.42 on Wednesday. They are up nearly 6 per cent since the IPO.
386;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-05T09:48:45Z;Services boost eurozone economy;;The eurozone’s recovery gathered pace in July, easing concerns that the region’s return to economic health had ground to a halt.The final composite purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data provider Markit, hit 53.8 in July, lower than a flash estimate of 54 but above the June level of 52.8 and the second-strongest reading for three years.Though the figure suggests levels of output remain far weaker than economists had hoped at the start of the year, the improvement will ease concerns that the eurozone economy was not growing at all.Gross domestic product figures, due out next week, are expected to show weak growth in the three months to June.The better PMI for the start of the third quarter came on the back of a stronger performance from the currency bloc’s dominant services sector. The separate reading for services rose to 54.2, a three-year high.The improved performance of the services sector will boost hopes that demand within the eurozone is strengthening.Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg Economics, said: “The eurozone recovery will remain modest, but will gradually firm from 0.2 per cent in the second quarter to 0.3 per cent in the third quarter and 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter.”The European Central Bank unveiled a package of measures in June which officials say will bolster growth and stamp out the threat of a crippling bout of deflation.But inflation fell to a four-and-a-half year low in July of 0.4 per cent – less than a quarter of the ECB’s target – reviving calls for policy makers to consider broad-based asset purchases, often referred to as quantitative easing.The region’s manufacturing recovery also appears to have weakened since the start of the year, leaving the pace of growth too lacklustre for businesses to consider taking on workers in significant numbers.“The PMI suggests GDP is growing at 0.4 per cent, but the worry is that this is still only generating very modest job creation,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “Faster growth is needed to have a meaningful impact on the near-record 11.5 per cent jobless rate.”Mr Williamson added that there was also a “great deal of uncertainty” about the direction of the recovery in the months ahead, with anxiety about the economic impact of the crisis in Ukraine mounting.Mr Wood said the actions of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, were the biggest risk to eurozone growth.“German confidence in particular has slipped a little. But with its strong fundamentals, Germany is in a good position to cope, while the former crisis countries are largely shielded from the effects of the conflict,” Mr Wood said. “We do not expect the Russian leader to wage open war against Ukraine . . . But this is a tail risk that we need to watch carefully.”
387;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-04T23:06:05Z;UK productivity still abysmal, report says;;Despite the UK’s economic recovery, productivity growth is “still abysmal”, real wages are running below the rate of inflation, and gross domestic product per head is unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels until 2017, according to a leading economic think-tank.The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that the British economy will grow by 3 per cent this year and business investment by 13 per cent as companies become more confident about domestic growth and prospects in the euro area – the UK’s main trading partner.A pick-up in business investment has helped the UK recovery to “become entrenched” and the organisation says it is optimistic that jobs will continue to be created and unemployment will fall below 6 per cent.But Simon Kirby, principal research fellow at NIESR, warned that households remain the key driver of economic growth and said Britain had not yet made up all the ground lost during the six years of recession that followed the global financial crisis.“There is still some catch-up to be done in the UK,” he added.Data from the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index out on Monday indicated that strong levels of housebuilding have produced the best period for UK construction activity since the financial crisis.Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said the survey “bucked the recent trend of slightly disappointing data releases”, adding “to the extent that much of construction activity reflects optimism about the economy, it is potentially important that new orders continued to rise very strongly”.Overall, the construction index moderated slightly to 62.4, down from 62.6 in June, but it has been above 50 – the line that separates expansion from contraction – for 15 consecutive months.Housebuilding has improved as the housing market has surged over the past year. House prices are 10.6 per cent higher than a year ago, according to the latest data from Nationwide, the building society.The construction sector accounts for only about 6 per cent of the UK economy, but it can send useful signals about business and household confidence.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the data added to signs that the UK was enjoying another period of strong growth in the third quarter. But he warned the survey also “fires some warning shots in relation to inflation”, with rates charged by subcontractors and prices for construction materials increasing sharply.As the recovery has progressed, the Bank of England has inched closer to raising rates from their record low of 0.5 per cent. Some economists think one or more members of the nine-person Monetary Policy Committee will vote for a rate rise at Thursday’s meeting.Mr Kirby said the market’s expectation of the first interest rate rise in February next year was plausible given the recent run of good economic data, but warned there was enormous uncertainty about the level of slack – or room for non-inflationary growth – in the labour market.He added “it is unfortunate so much importance is stressed in policy making circles on an unobservable”.The BoE’s has said it wants to see slack reduced before it raises rates from their historic lows, but there is considerable disagreement among economists on how best to measure the concept.A number of MPC members have said they believe the level of spare capacity is shrinking as employment continues to rise. But a separate NIESR paper from former- MPC member Danny Blanchflower published on Wednesday argues that the UK labour market is “much further from full employment than the MPC calculates”.
388;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
389;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-08-04T11:28:47Z;UK survey points to strong housebuilding growth;;Housebuilding is driving the best period for UK construction activity since the financial crisis.The housebuilding component of the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index hit 68 in July, the highest level since November 2003.Overall, the index moderated slightly to 62.4, down from 62.6 in June, but it has now been above 50 – the line that separates expansion from contraction – for 15 consecutive months. This was slightly higher than City economists expected.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the sector was “enjoying its strongest cyclical upswing since the global financial crisis”.He suggested that the strong readings “raise the likelihood” that the official output figures for construction, disappointingly weak in preliminary second-quarter gross domestic product data, will be revised upwards.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said the housebuilding sector was “racing ahead this quarter with the fastest growth in construction of homes for over a decade”.Housebuilding has improved as the housing market has surged back over the past year. House prices are 10.6 per cent higher than a year ago, according to the latest data from Nationwide, the building society.The PMI poll found construction companies were hiring workers at the fastest pace since the survey began in April 1997.Respondents reported low stocks and capacity shortages at suppliers, along with input price inflation near a six-month high.The construction sector only accounts for about 6 per cent of the UK economy, but it can send useful signals about business and household confidence.Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said: “To the extent that much of construction activity reflects optimism about the economy, it is potentially important that new orders continued to rise very strongly in today’s construction PMI, driven by favourable domestic economic conditions and greater confidence among clients.”The International Monetary Fund forecasts the UK economy will grow 3.2 per cent this year, outstripping every other member of the G7 group of rich countries. However, most economists expect the pace of growth to moderate in the second half of the year. Some indicators have already started to cool.As the recovery has progressed, the Bank of England has inched closer to raising rates from their record low of 0.5 per cent. Some economists think one or more members of the nine-person Monetary Policy Committee will vote for a rate rise at Thursday’s meeting.
390;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;François Hollande’s mood frays over stalled economy;Lack of growth and job creation is a worry;François Hollande is known for his bonhomie, his wisecracks – and a relentless optimism in the face of adversity. But for the first time since he took office two years ago, that optimism shows signs of eroding in the face of France’s stalled economy.At a dinner for the Elysée Palace press corps this week, France’s most unpopular postwar president admitted it was “not impossible” the economy would weaken further over the rest of the year, just when he had counted on a much-needed cyclical upturn.It followed an admission in a Bastille day broadcast that his promise to reverse rising unemployment by the end of last year had been mistaken. He was also forced to amend a cheery declaration he made on the same occasion last year that “the recovery is here!”. Now, he said sheepishly, “it is here, but it is too feeble”.The lack of growth and job creation is particularly worrying given the more robust recovery under way elsewhere in Europe.France stood out in the July purchasing managers’ index published by Markit on Thursday as the weak link in an otherwise strengthening eurozone rebound. Solid returns by the service sector cushioned the French figures, but overall activity at 49.4 remained below the 50 mark that signals expansion, while the euro bloc as a whole hit a three-month high of 54. The index for French manufacturing hit a seven-month low at 47.5.The Markit index is sometimes portrayed as being overly pessimistic about France. But the July business climate index compiled by Insee, the French national statistics body, stood at 93, well below the long term average of 100.A note this month on the French economy by Axa, the big French insurer, declared that “doom and gloom are firmly rooted” in France. “The recovery has been sluggish and feels nearly as painful as the recession. A sense of secular decline and structural inertia is undermining animal spirit and trust in the future,” it said.For Mr Hollande and his Socialist government, rebuilt in April around reformist prime minister Manuel Valls, the frustration is acute. The president has nailed his colours to a pro-business “responsibility pact” that promises €40bn in tax cuts and €50bn in public spending savings over the next three years, along with other reforms such as a relaxation of France’s restrictive labour market regulation.They are policies his critics say he should have enacted when he took power two years ago. But the Elysée clearly expected that the change of direction would at least boost business confidence.Instead, business has remained sullen, investment has continued to lag and employment has not picked up. Pierre Gattaz, the combative head of Medef, the business confederation, said in a newspaper interview this week that the state of the economy was “catastrophic”.That earned an angry public riposte from Mr Hollande, who is busy fending off dissent within Socialist ranks by rebels who accuse him of having surrendered to the business lobby.In recent weeks, the president has succeeded in getting some key elements of his reform package through parliament, despite the internal rebellion. But there is precious little summer holiday cheer for Mr Hollande and his ministers.Another battle with the rebels looms in September when the government presents the 2015 budget. Ministers have signalled they will be forced to downgrade their growth forecasts for this year and next, from the already modest projections of 1.0 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.That in turn will make it more difficult than ever to meet next year’s target of reducing the budget deficit within the EU’s designated limit of 3 per cent of national output.Mr Hollande has said he will not add further spending cuts to meet the target, raising the prospect of a renewed wrangle with Brussels and the austerity hawks across the Rhine in Germany.Little wonder the president’s mood appears to be fraying.
391;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-21T11:16:29Z;Tech Beat: The new Markits;;"Market infrastructure providers are providing venture capital to start-ups as senior banking executives accept a radical approach to technology may be the only way to survive in their present form.A triple whammy of tougher regulation, low volumes and ever-rising fixed costs are forcing senior executives in banks to accept substantial change, potentially opening the capital markets to changes from which it has hitherto been immune.Big trends such as cloud computing and open source technology have had limited impact on capital markets. Last year the US Securities and Exchange Commission, looking to crunch large volumes of data, opted for an industry that is ahead of anything Silicon Valley could muster.The global investment market, known as “fintech”, has tripled in the past five years to nearly $3bn, according to research from Accenture in March. But as the consultancy pointed out, most has gone into banking, electronic and mobile payments and lending companies.Consequently in recent months Deutsche Börse, Europe’s largest bourse, and CME Group, the US futures exchange, have announced venture funds to encourage ideas.“The idea is to harness the power of entrepreneurship and the rapid pace of technological advancement to grow our industry and our business,” said Mark Fields, managing director of CME’s Strategic Investment Group, at the time of launch.Hopefuls could one day emulate companies such as Markit, the UK data provider worth $5bn, and IntercontinentalExchange, one of the world’s largest exchanges operators by market value.Both were founded in the rush of money and creativity of the dotcom boom. The former was conceived as an online collector and distributor of credit data. ICE started out as an eBay for energy trading.Bob Gach, global capital markets managing director at Accenture, says there are parallels with today's market, with layers of tough regulation, as found in Dodd-Frank and Basel III, providing the incentive to create more mini-Markits.“Years ago the incentive was on creating trading platforms like ICE and FxAll [now owned by Thomson Reuters]. The regulation will help see that grow; it will be attractive for people in the banks to create these apps. At the same time, it’s creating a virtuous circle in the banks willing to look at innovation,” he says.Among the hottest areas for start-ups are helping banks manage reference data, collateral and know-your-customer requirements, and Mr Gach said the post-crisis push to standardise the tags attached to trades on the world’s markets would be key.“If you look at other innovations, when the standard was created, it starts a lot of innovation. Legal Entity Identifiers are changing everything,” he said.But those hopefuls who harbour ambitions face a different set of challenges to start-ups in other parts of the economy – ones that require more than an app at the Apple Store.Banks and exchanges are heavily regulated – in part to protect the customer information that a full corporate overhaul would endanger. Understanding legal requirements requires specialist knowledge, often from insiders.As a result, the number of people who can open doors is more limited. “Your average UK venture capital firm knows very little about capital markets outside payments. It’s still quite an open space, though patience is required. Getting your foot in the door is the most challenging thing,” says Matt Wreford, who used to head the private investment company of Michael Spencer, founder of interdealer broker ICAP. He is now chief executive and co-founder of Vernier Partners, a Californian fintech start-up.Even then it can be a struggle. “When you’re trying to set up a business, you’ve got to have another client as an anchor,” says Stu Taylor, chief executive of Algomi, a start-up trying to get banks to manage their in-house bond liquidity trades. “Once you have that, you risk money on an idea. The biggest problem is inertia.”Big names such as CME and Deutsche Börse are offering a helping hand. For them the example of ICE and Markit has shown the rewards for taking stakes in the winners.Inevitably many hopefuls will fail and consolidate. Nevertheless, as Mr Wreford points out: “Once you have built a business that is at the heart of the core market infrastructure, it’s a very resilient place to be.”"
392;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-08T17:22:41Z;Short selling drops to lowest level since Lehman;Data show hedge funds are unwilling to bet against the rally;"Hedge funds have sharply scaled back their bearish bets that the value of stocks is about to fall, with the proportion of shares earmarked for short selling at its lowest level since before the financial crisis despite warnings of renewed market exuberance.The percentage of stocks that have been borrowed by short sellers – who try to profit from a company’s share price falling – has dropped to the lowest level in the US, UK and the rest of Europe since the years before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to data compiled for the Financial Times by Markit.The fall in short selling comes as Wall Street and markets in Europe trade at near record and multiyear highs, indicating that while some high profile hedge fund managers have warned of excessive market euphoria the industry is still unwilling to bet against the rally.The amount of so-called short interest in the benchmark US S&P 500 index is hovering around 2 per cent of total shares in the index, close to the lowest level since Markit began collecting the data in 2006. In the European Stoxx 600 index, the level is similar at just over 2 per cent, while short interest in the UK FTSE All-Share index stands at less than 1 per cent.This compares with sharply elevated levels in the years preceding the credit crisis, with the data showing short interest in the US in 2007 hitting a high of 5.5 per cent. The Markit data does not take into account all changes in stock indices over the period.Buoyed in part by injections of cheap money from central banks, including the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase programme, leading stock markets have continued to rise this year after enjoying strong gains in 2013, forcing some hedge funds to cut their short bets to avoid being squeezed.As the FTSE All-World and S&P 500 have set records, volatility has faded away, with one measure, the Vix index or “Wall Street fear gauge” dropping to a near seven-year low.Historically, periods of low volatility usually lead to further periods of volatility, they are not precursors to a crisisThis has prompted a string of recent warnings from a number of leading hedge fund managers such as Baupost’s Seth Klarman, CQS’s Michael Hintze and David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital about the distortions being caused by ultra-low interest rates and bubbles in some asset classes.Closely-followed short sellers such as Mr Einhorn have argued that US technology shares have reached “bubble” valuations, but have bemoaned the difficulty of making bets against them given the level of hype surrounding the sector.“It is dangerous to short stocks that have disconnected from traditional valuation methods,” Mr Einhorn told his clients earlier this year. “After all, twice a silly price is not twice as silly; it’s still just silly”.However, despite a jittery period for some technology stocks in the first half, investors have been undeterred by the warnings, with some analysts arguing that shares are still cheap compared with other assets.“Historically, periods of low volatility usually lead to further periods of volatility, they are not precursors to a crisis,” said Antonin Jullier, global head of equity trading strategy at Citi.Mr Jullier said that some hedge funds had become discouraged from short selling as a result of being repeatedly wrongfooted by rising markets.“Hedge funds have underperformed in the first half and this means their appetite for risk has fallen over the year,” he said.Rising stock markets have coincided with sharp price increases for other asset classes, ranging from Jeff Koons’s sculptures to junk bonds and London house prices, prompting concerns among some investors that markets have lapsed back into complacency."
393;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-03T10:12:49Z;London rallies after strong services data;;The FTSE 100 made broad-based gains to a three-week high on Thursday, led by its riskier sectors after robust numbers from the services sector added to the data seen this week pointing towards sustained economic growth in the UK.The Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers’ Index for June remained firmly established over the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction, reading 57.7.London’s main equities index rose 0.4 per cent to 6,846.37 in morning trade, taking it back to levels last seen on June 12.Banking and mining stocks led the way, as risk appetite sharpened. Chilean copper miner Antofagasta was among the best gainers, up 3.8 per cent at 811p. Anglo American gained 1.5 per cent to £15.07.Energy explorer Tullow Oil rose 1.1 per cent to 858.4p after it said one of its prospects in the North Sea was found to contain crude. Preliminary estimates showed the well could contain up to 50m barrels of oil.The rally was broad based, with only eight FTSE 100 stocks falling by more than 0.3 per cent, with a trend for the decliners to share defensive properties.Among them, United Utilities fell 0.5 per cent to 887p and was the biggest single faller. Royal Mail fell 0.4 per cent to 477.3p.Lower down the market, a warning from Balfour Beatty that its mechanical and electrical engineering arm would miss profit forecasts sent shares in the company down by as much as 15 per cent to 197p. It was the biggest loss on the FTSE 250.Overall, the mid-cap index rose 0.5 per cent to 15,980.88, with its financial stocks leading the way as the mood improved across global markets. Hedge fund Man Group was the best single stock, up 6.5 per cent at 114.2p. Interdealer broker Tullett Prebon gained 2.9 per cent to 264.7p.
394;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Services sector survey points to rapid UK growth;;Britain’s vast services sector grew strongly last month, according to a survey, spurring companies to embark on the biggest hiring spree in the poll’s history.The purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, an unofficial but closely watched indicator, showed the economy was “firing on all cylinders,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the company that compiles the surveys.It follows similarly strong surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors, which together point to economic growth of about 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, he added. That would sustain the momentum of the first quarter and suggest the UK economy was growing at a rapid clip.The headline “activity” index for the services sector fell from 58.6 in May to 57.7 in June – but held well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction in activity.The poll also showed very rapid employment growth in the sector that accounts for about four-fifths of the UK economy: the employment sub-index climbed from 56.2 to 58.8, the highest reading in the survey’s history. New business grew at the fastest rate in six months.Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said the surveys signalled that “further very rapid falls in unemployment are in prospect, which will put pressure on the BoE to hike rates earlier than they may have been planning on a few months ago.”“We expect the first rate hike in November this year.”So far wages in the UK have remained extremely weak even though unemployment has been falling fast. The services PMI hinted that might start to change: many panellists attributed a net rise in their operating costs in June to higher average salaries and wage costs.There were also reports of higher food, insurance and subcontractor costs – something that has yet to show up in the UK’s subdued official inflation rate, which was just 1.5 per cent in May.
395;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-02T09:41:02Z;UK construction sector gains momentum;;Construction activity in the UK increased at the fastest pace for four months in June thanks to a steep rise in house building and commercial projects, according to a survey.The small and volatile construction sector – which accounts for about 6 per cent of the UK economy – also reported the most frenetic hiring spree since the survey started 17 years ago.The purchasing managers’ index compiled by data company Markit rebounded from a slight dip, rising from 60 in May to 62.6 in June. Any number above 50 indicates activity is increasing.The engine for that expansion was a sharp increase in housebuilding, spurred by the recovering housing market.All of the UK’s large housebuilders have been reporting increases in activity as they seek to respond to the increased demand brought about by the government’s Help to Buy equity loan scheme.Persimmon, the UK’s biggest builder by market capitalisation, on Wednesday reported 6,408 completions in the first half of the year – a 28 per cent rise compared with the same period in 2013.Yet demand is still outpacing supply: separate data from Nationwide on Wednesday showed average house prices in the UK had surpassed their 2007 peak by that survey’s measure, rising nearly 12 per cent in the past year.London house prices were 26 per cent higher than a year ago.The construction survey showed activity on commercial projects also rose at the fastest pace since January, which builders attributed to growing business confidence. According to the latest Lloyds Bank Business Barometer, companies’ confidence in their own prospects and the wider economy recovered in June following a sharp drop in May.The construction sector was particularly badly hit by the 2008/9 recession and its output remains about a tenth lower than before the crisis hit.But in a positive sign for the sector’s momentum, the PMI survey’s respondents said their order books were expanding quickly.The constructing poll follows a similarly positive survey of the manufacturing sector on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said they pointed to another quarter of strong economic growth in the UK. The economy grew 0.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year and was 3 per cent bigger than a year earlier.“Such persistent strong growth adds to the chance of interest rates starting to rise later this year, rather than a first rate hike being delayed until 2015,” Mr Williamson said.Evidence of continued strong growth in the UK has pushed sterling to a six-year high.
396;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-01T17:08:31Z;UK manufacturing growth soars but productivity remains dire;;"The best and worst of the British economy was on show on Tuesday as data showed manufacturing was booming but productivity and living standards were languishing after the financial crisis.Britain’s factories enjoyed one of their best quarters of output growth in 20 years, according to a survey of purchasing managers by data company Markit. Order books were filling up and workforces were expanding, the poll suggested. “The industrial recovery remains in full flow,” concluded Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics.The good news bolstered economists’ confidence that the UK’s surprisingly swift economic recovery was continuing apace.Although manufacturing only accounts for about 10 per cent of the economy, the sector has traditionally been a contributor to higher incomes and productivity in the UK.Indeed, separate official data on Tuesday suggested a period of weak manufacturing productivity was coming to an end.The annual increase in manufacturing output per hour worked reached 3 per cent in the first quarter, with the gains concentrated in the high-tech sectors of computing, electrical products, machine tools and transport equipment.The growth of productivity led to a small decline in unit wage costs, which will help to offset the strength of sterling for exporters.But in spite of the progress in the manufacturing sector, the big picture for UK productivity remained bleak.Output per hour fell 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year and was 4.3 per cent points lower than before the 2008 recession.Revisions to Britain’s national accounts this September may reduce the scale of the gap slightly.But the Bank of England estimated recently that output per hour in 2013 was 16 per cent below the level that could have been expected had the pre-recession trends continued; it believes no more than 2 percentage points of that are likely to be eliminated by the revisions.Dire productivity since the financial crisis has been one of the biggest puzzles and worries for UK policy makers, since in the long run it is only by becoming more productive that the country can grow more prosperous.Ian McCafferty, an external member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, warned last month that most of the productivity shortfall would persist as the economy recovered because it had more fundamental roots.But Michael Saunders, an economist at Citi, argued that weak productivity was at least partly the result of people accepting lower wages in order to hang on to their jobs, which in turn had made UK growth more “labour-intensive”. That was no bad thing, he added.“It’s a sort of shared pain approach in which everyone suffers through a drop in real wages, rather than a small share of the population losing out through unemployment while everybody else gets a real pay rise, which is what used to happen,” he said.Tuesday’s annual official data on household incomes demonstrated the extent of that “shared pain”.The decline in living standards finally came to an end in the fiscal year 2012-13 – just before the economy started to rebound – with median household real incomes about the same as the previous year. Yet they remained about 6 per cent lower than before the crisis.The trends were very similar across different income groups and income inequality barely changed between 2011-12 and 2012-13.Inequality has fallen in previous years as benefits – which account for a larger share of poorer people’s incomes – have risen faster than wages.About 17 per cent of the population was below the absolute poverty line (incomes below £272 per week for a childless couple, net of taxes and including benefits) – about 200,000 fewer than in the previous year.However, after housing costs were deducted, the number below the poverty line increased by about 600,000 to 23 per cent, the highest in more than a decade.Disabled people appeared to fare badly: the percentage of people in absolute poverty where at least one member was disabled increased from 20 per cent to 22 per cent, continuing rises seen since 2009-10.Hannah Aldridge, a senior researcher at the New Policy Institute, a think-tank, said poorer people were likely to start to fall behind the rest of the population because the government’s benefit cuts really started to bite in 2013-14.“It’s not going to be a particularly quick recovery for the people in the middle and for poorest its not going to be a recovery at all,” she said.Additional reporting by Brian Groom"
397;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-01T10:03:40Z;Strong UK manufacturing activity points to robust growth;;Britain’s manufacturing sector finished the second quarter on a strong note, with an index of sentiment among purchasing managers suggesting rapid output growth and an improvement in the sector’s productivity.The bullish figures, and relative weakness in the eurozone, helped the pound rise to $1.7132, its highest level since October 2008. The FTSE 100 was up 0.4 per cent at 6,771.39, with the FTSE 250, seen as more representative of the domestic UK economy, up 0.2 per cent.The survey of manufacturing PMI stood at 57.5, its second-highest level in over three years and up from 57 in May. These levels, at which the index has hovered since last summer, suggested “a robust second quarter”, according to Markit, the consultancy which compiles the figures.The strength in monthly manufacturing PMIs has been reflected in the more accurate but less timely official output data, which grew at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent in April.Separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the country’s weak labour productivity continued in the first quarter of the year, however, with output per hour falling 0.1 per cent compared with the previous quarter.Output per hour remains 4.3 percentage points below the level of early 2008, before the downturn.The components of the manufacturing PMI suggested the sector would remain strong over the months ahead. The level of new business orders was the highest since November and export orders also strengthened.Manufacturers had the confidence to continue increasing employment with the job creation component of the PMI at a 39-month high.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “UK manufacturing continued to flourish in June, rounding off one of the best quarters for the sector over the past two decades.”Although the sector accounts for only 10 per cent of the British economy, manufacturing has traditionally been a driver of higher incomes and productivity.There were signs in official data that the period in which manufacturing productivity has sagged were coming to an end with the annual increase of manufacturing output per hour worked reaching 3 per cent in the first quarter.The gains in manufacturing productivity were concentrated in the high-tech sectors of computing, electrical products, machine tools and transport equipment.The growth of productivity led to a small decline in unit wage costs, which will help to offset the strength of sterling for exporters.Commenting on the data, which was published on Tuesday, Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said: “So far this year it’s been the domestic market that had been a particular source of strength, but we should be encouraged that new orders from overseas markets are now coming through.”Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said with manufacturing data this strong even with stronger sterling, the quarterly rate of economic growth was likely to remain close to 1 per cent and “would support the case for [an interest rate] hike this side of Christmas”.Additional reporting by Brian Groom
398;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-07-01T09:11:36Z;Eurozone’s manufacturing recovery slows;;A slowdown in the recovery of the eurozone’s manufacturers was confirmed on Tuesday, after the final reading of a closely watched poll of purchasing managers dipped to its lowest level this year.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturers in the currency bloc fell to 51.8 last month, down from 52.2 in May and slightly below a flash estimate of 51.9.While the PMI – a gauge of momentum – remained above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity for the 12th straight month, the June reading was the lowest since last November.The dip in the PMI was due to the poorer performance of the currency bloc’s largest economies, Germany and France. The region’s more troubled periphery fared better, with the reading for Spain, the bloc’s fourth-largest economy, hitting its highest level for seven years.Markit, which compiles the index, reported a deepening of the downturn in activity in France, the bloc’s second-largest economy, where the PMI fell to a six-month low of 48.2. Factory activity in the bloc’s largest economy, Germany, continued to expand, but only at its slowest pace for eight months.“The overall picture is a reminder of just how fragile the region’s recovery is looking,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.The PMI reading for new orders dipped to its lowest level since October, suggesting activity could remain weak in the months ahead.Mr Williamson said: “The slowdown will put pressure on policy makers at the European Central Bank to do more to prevent the recovery from stalling, and we will no doubt see more calls for full-scale quantitative easing.”ECB officials meet on Thursday to vote on whether to change monetary policy in the bloc. However, few expect policy makers to act so soon after unveiling a package of extraordinary measures, including negative interest rates, in June.Separately, Eurostat reported that eurozone unemployment remained at 11.6 per cent in May. The number of people in the labour market without work fell by 28,000 over the month to 18.55m.
399;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-06-23T08:58:05Z;Survey suggests pace of eurozone recovery slowing;Downturn in France deepening as conditions in periphery improve;"The pace of the eurozone’s recovery has slowed this month, despite more signs that conditions in the currency bloc’s hard-hit periphery are improving.A flash estimate of a closely watched poll of purchasing managers in the region fell to its lowest level this year on the back of indications of a deepening downturn in its second-largest economy, France.The composite purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data company Markit, fell to 52.8 – a level above the crucial 50 figure which marks an expansion in activity, but below the May reading of 53.5. It is the lowest reading since December.The initial poll, which will be followed at the beginning of July by the final figures, showed that activity remained robust in Germany, the bloc’s strongest economy, while growth in parts of the periphery was the strongest since August 2007. However, signs of a contraction in activity in France’s manufacturing and services sectors, coupled with the sharpest fall in headcount since February, weighed on the regional reading.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The big concern is once again the divergent trends within the eurozone.“Although the survey suggests the eurozone as a whole should grow by at least 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, France appears to be entering a renewed downturn after GDP stagnated in the first quarter,” he added. The bloc’s economy grew by just 0.2 per cent in the opening quarter of 2014.The composite PMI surveys purchasing managers in the services and manufacturing sectors. The reading for the dominant services industry fell to a three-month low of 52.8; for manufacturing, it dropped to a nine-month low of 51.9.The poll suggested disinflationary pressures in the bloc were easing, with input prices rising by the fastest rate since last November. The rise in costs was highest for services companies in more than a year and a half. It was also the first time since January that manufacturers’ costs increased.At 0.5 per cent, inflation is little more than a quarter of the European Central Bank’s target of below but close to 2 per cent."
400;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rising consumer sentiment lifts Kroger profits;;Kroger, the US grocer, led the benchmark S&P 500 on Thursday after lifting its full-year earnings guidance and reporting first-quarter profits and sales ahead of Wall Street expectations.Sales at the Ohio-based supermarket chain rose 9.9 per cent from a year earlier to $33bn, as consumers exhibited “less cautious” shopping patterns, adding to several recent economic reports that have shown a rebound in US economic activity.Profits rose 4 per cent from a year earlier to $501m, or 98 cents per share. Adjusting for certain pension change charges, Kroger said it earned $1.09 in the three months to May 24.On a call with analysts, chief executive Rodney McMullen said the company was seeing positive indicators as the economy continued to recover.“Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behaviour,” Mr McMullen said. “Consistent with the rise in the consumer confidence index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery.”Kroger now projects earnings for the year between $3.19 and $3.27 a share, with same-store sales expected to rise as much as 4 per cent from a year earlier. Analysts with Oppenheimer lifted their earnings forecasts as a result.“Sales trends are likely to remain strong over the next few quarters, in our view, as company investments take hold, inflation benefits accelerate, and the US jobs backdrop improves,” analyst Rupesh Parikh said.Kroger was the last company within the S&P 500 index to report first-quarter results. Earnings for the index rose 3.4 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Those figures outpaced expectations earlier in the year, when severe winter weather crimped most forecasts.Kroger shares advanced just over 5 per cent to close at $49.66 while rival Supervalu rose 0.63 per cent to $7.95.Shares of Red Hat increased 3.79 per cent to $55.11 after the software company said sales rose 17 per cent to $424m.Analysts with Susquehanna maintained their neutral rating but increased the company’s target price from $54 to $57 a share, citing Red Hat’s recently announced acquisition of eNovance as well as its product pipeline.Shares in Measurement Specialties, a maker of sensors and sensor-based systems, jumped almost 11 per cent to close at $86.38 after TE Connectivity announced plans to acquire the company for $1.7bn including debt.The $86-a-share deal represents a 10 per cent premium on Wednesday’s closing price and gives TE access to Measurement Specialties’ range of pressure, vibration, force, temperature, humidity, position and fluid sensors.Measurement Specialties is expected to generate $540m in sales during the current fiscal year.Industries from energy to manufacturing are increasingly connected via the “internet of things”, as oil rigs, manufacturing equipment and ships, to name a few, “talk” to their administrators, increasing efficiency and enabling real-time monitoring.Shares in TE increased 0.29 per cent to $62.23.As Markit makes its US debut, shares in the financial data provider climbed almost 10 per cent as they began trading in New York. The stock closed at $26.70 after selling for $24 on Wednesday night.The offering raised $1.28bn, which will primarily go to selling stockholders. However, analysts say Markit is now in a better position to compete with rivals including Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.Coach shares led the declines on the S&P 500, touching the lowest level since 2010, after executives said comparable sales would continue to decline in its 2015 fiscal year.Shares in the handbag retailer tumbled almost 9 per cent to close at $35.69.Overall, US equities ended mixed following the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.13 per cent to close at 1,959.48 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09 per cent to 16,921.46. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.08 per cent to end the day at 4,359.33.
401;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Data provider Markit raises $1.3bn in IPO;;Markit, the UK data provider, raised $1.28bn in an initial public offering priced on Wednesday after increasing the size of the deal, according to people familiar with the situation.Shares in the company were offered at $24, the midpoint of the $23 and $25 price range set three weeks ago, the people said. That gives London-based Markit a market capitalisation of about $4.5bn.That valuation is likely to give it a march on rivals as it bids to consolidate the fast-growing but fragmented market for providing, hosting and processing complex financial data.The amount raised is set to go to the consortium of investment banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are selling down their stakes. However, the float will give Markit, led by Canadian Lance Uggla, a currency through which it can make further acquisitions and challenge larger global rivals Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and IBM Analytics.The company increased the size of its IPO, selling 53.5m shares, up from 45.7m originally planned.Its listing on Nasdaq represents a coup for New York since London has remained Markit’s headquarters since it was founded 11 years ago by a group of former credit traders. It has become a largely transatlantic business, making net profits of $139m on revenues of $948m last year. Much of that growth has come by acquiring other financial technology companies.It began by offering credit derivatives pricing but has since expanded to oversee pricing and valuation in a range of difficult to obtain financial data. It has also pushed into forecasting risk and processing over-the-counter derivatives, areas that have assumed greater importance for regulators following the financial crisis.The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, one of Canada’s largest pension funds, previously expressed an interest in buying as much as $450m of shares at the IPO price.Many of the selling shareholders on the deal also were managers of the IPO.www.ft.com/tradingroom
402;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Construction data signal strong growth;;The UK construction industry grew strongly in April, providing further evidence the economic recovery has broadened out from the service sector.Output rose 4.6 per cent in April on the previous year, and 1.2 per cent compared with the previous month. The Office for National Statistics also revised up its estimates for first-quarter growth in the sector from 0.6 to 1.5 per cent.Adding to the positive picture, data earlier this week, showed the manufacturing sector growing at its fastest pace in three years.The construction and manufacturing data are the first concrete figures of the performance of the UK economy in the second quarter of the year.While gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year grew at a robust 3.1 per cent, the lion’s share of the improvement was driven by the services sector, with manufacturing and construction still remaining well below their pre-crisis peak.If data from the other sectors of the economy remain unchanged, the latest data would push GDP growth in the first quarter up from 0.8 to 0.9 per cent – the strongest expansion for nearly four years.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey data provider Markit, said the surging construction and manufacturing sectors suggested the economy was in line for another spell of strong growth, bringing forward expectations of the first interest rate rise.“A booming construction industry, faster than previously thought economic growth at the start of the year, and hawkish remarks from the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney point to interest rates starting to rise later this year,” he said.New work was up 4.9 per cent, with much of the increase driven by the private housing sector.But there was mixed news in the detail of the data, with new orders in the first quarter estimated to be 6.3 per cent lower than the final quarter of 2013, while public sector housing and infrastructure work tumbled, down 45.7 and 16.5 per cent respectively.Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said that while activity might have come off recent peak levels “the prospects look generally bright across most sectors.“Extended improved economic activity and increased business confidence should underpin healthy commercial construction activity while civil engineering activity is robust.”
403;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-06-03T20:13:16Z;Construction sector still struggles to rebuild after recession;;Building activity is rising so strongly that supply bottlenecks are beginning to emerge, according to a survey of purchasing managers published on Tuesday. But a more detailed look at the evidence shows the sector still struggling after the recession.Most of the evidence from the construction sector PMI was positive. Buoyed by rapid rises in house building, the headline activity indicator remained near an all-time high. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, the consultancy that produced the figures, said they showed, the sector “enjoying its strongest overall phase of expansion since the summer of 2007”.Rising building activity is being driven by a strong property market, which has seen prices return to their pre-crisis peak, according to the Nationwide Building Society index. The Nationwide recorded an annual growth rate of 11.1 per cent in May.But increased activity, rapid house price growth and what Markit called “shortages of stock and supply-chain bottlenecks” do not show that the building sector is back to rude health. Output remains far from what it was in boom times, according to industry figures and official statistics.Even though growth is strong, construction output remains 12 per cent below the level recorded in 2008 and although builders started on 21 per cent more homes in Britain last year, housing starts still have a long way to climb back to their pre-recession levels.While the Construction Products Association lobby group agreed with Markit that there were some specific supply shortages, it added that there was no general lack of capacity in the sector: only 19 per cent of companies producing heavy building materials, such as bricks and concrete blocks, report that they are operating between 90 per cent and full capacity.Noble Francis, economics director of the association, said: “Capacity utilisation is expected to rise in line with demand and 26 per cent of heavy side firms expect to operate at between 90 per cent and full capacity in the next year but this does not mean there may not be some issues for a particular material or in a particular region”.Those problems are highlighted in official figures that show bricks and concrete blocks deliveries have risen sharply over the past year, leading to a drop in unsold stocks.For many building companies, falling stocks are not a serious problem because they have long-term contracts with manufacturers but where there have been shortages of construction materials, there is also evidence of rising prices and higher imports.Brick prices have risen 7.2 per cent in the year to March and imports of bricks have returned almost to their pre-recession level.Mr Francis said: “Brick production in March was 26 per cent higher than a year ago and imports of bricks in the fourth quarter of last year were double the level of one year earlier.”If the industry has a long way to go to get back to pre-recession levels, it is unlikely to be the same once it does.The building sector has seen one of the largest shifts to self employment: labour figures for the industry are still in the doldrums at just under 1.3m, compared with a pre-crisis peak of 1.6m. In contrast, the number of self-employed builders in the first quarter of the year was 884,000, an all-time high.
404;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-06-03T18:35:59Z;China leads EM manufacturing uptick;;Stronger readings in China helped drive a marginal uptick in emerging market (EM) manufacturing activity in May, breaking a declining trend that has lasted for five consecutive months, according to purchasing manager index (PMI) data aggregated by Capital Economics.The Capital Economics data, which showed an EM manufacturing PMI for May of 50.1 compared to 49.6 in April, coincided with a slight upswing in investment bank sentiment toward the Chinese economy. Nomura raised its China GDP forecast for the year, while Barclays saw a further easing in Beijing’s monetary policy.Capital Economics aggregates EM PMI data collected by Markit, a research company, and weights it according to the size of each country’s GDP. Markit is due to publish its own monthly EM manufacturing data on Friday. The chart below shows the slight uptick in May’s PMI number and the close correlation between the Markit and Capital Economics numbers over time.Much of the improvement in the overall manufacturing index in May came from a moderation in China’s manufacturing growth slowdown (see chart below). The Markit manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.4, up from 48.1 in April.Evidence for a stabilisation in Chinese factory output was reinforced this week with the release of China’s official manufacturing PMI, which rose to a five-month high of 50.8 in May, up from 50.4 and 50.3 in April and March respectively.“The upside surprise was led by new orders index, which rose to a six-month high, reflecting the government’s continued effort since mid-March to boost investment and construction activities,” said Barclays in a research note.“We maintain our view of a recovery in growth momentum in (the second quarter). GDP growth come in at around 7.4 per cent in (the second quarter), slightly higher than our current forecast of 7.2 per cent,” it added.Nomura raised its GDP growth forecast on Tuesday to 7.4 per cent in the second quarter from 7.1 per cent previously and for the full year to 7.5 per cent from 7.4 per cent previously. It said the revision reflected not only an improvement in leading indicators (including the PMIs), but also an “intensification of policy easing measures already taken, with more expected”.Beijing’s latest stimulus measures were revealed last week, when China’s cabinet said it would reduce the amount of deposits banks have to keep on reserve at the central bank in order to support smaller companies and agricultural businesses. That came after an unusual public order from the finance ministry telling local governments to speed up disbursements of funds to ensure the completion of large projects and boost slowing growth.In recent weeks, Beijing has also sped up construction of railways and public housing, cut taxes for small companies and ordered commercial banks to provide more mortgage loans to home buyers.Source: Capital EconomicsA couple of shifts among EM countries are apparent in the May data. Whereas eastern European countries that supply Germany’s manufacturing base have been the big outperformers so far this year, the May data also showed gathering strength in Mexico and Asia (see chart below) – particularly in Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Taiwan.This suggests a broader-based EM manufacturing recovery, led both by demand from the US and the uptick from China.By contrast, poor performers included EM countries such as Brazil and South Africa, where manufacturers have seen their competitiveness eroded by “Dutch disease” – an overvaluation of their exchange rate due to net commodity exports. In the case of South Africa, however, protracted strikes in the industrial heartland have also hit output hard.Back to beyondbrics
405;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;PMI points to eurozone manufacturing slowdown;Lower reading partly down to weaker jobs figures;A slowdown in the recovery of eurozone manufacturers was confirmed on Monday, with a closely watched poll of purchasing managers falling to its lowest level in six months in May.The final manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for last month, compiled by data company Markit, registered 52.2. Though the PMI remains above the crucial 50 level that indicates an expansion in activity, it is down from 53.4 in April and marks the lowest reading for six months.The gauge of momentum showed that only Spain and the Netherlands saw a rise in momentum last month. Factory activity in France slipped, with the region’s second-largest economy the only one of the seven economies covered by the poll where the PMI fell below 50.Worryingly for a region where unemployment remains close to record highs, the lower reading for the eurozone was partly down to a weaker figure for the jobs component of the index. The sub index for employment fell from 51.3 to 50.5, its lowest level since March.A fall in the reading for new orders, from 53.9 to 52.3, suggested rises in activity could remain sluggish in the months ahead.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the fall in the PMI would add to calls for the European Central Bank to add stimulus to the economy by easing monetary policy later this week. However, Mr Williamson argued the case for more central bank action was not so clear cut.“Taken together, the PMI surveys [for manufacturing and services activity] are pointing to a second-quarter GDP increase of about 0.5 per cent,” Mr Williamson said, though he acknowledged the weaker figure for Germany was a cause for concern for policy makers.The reading for the bloc’s biggest economy fell to a seven-month low of 52.3.
406;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chinese factory data lift risk appetite;;Thursday 21:10 BST. Signs of improvement in China’s manufacturing sector paved the way for global equities to edge higher, with underlying support coming from the latest signals from the US Federal Reserve that it was in no hurry to start raising interest rates.The minutes of the Fed’s April policy meeting, released on Wednesday, indicated little shift in the central bank’s economic outlook, while a technical discussion on its exit strategy from loose monetary policy did not reach a firm conclusion.In New York, the S&P 500 equity index rose 0.2 per cent to 1,894, leaving it 0.3 per cent shy of its recent record close. The CBOE Vix index of implied equity volatility – often called Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – was hovering around its lowest level of the year.“Implied volatility, whether in FX, bond or equity markets, has not only been trending lower but is trading close to, and in some instances at, historical lows,” said Divyang Shah, global strategist at IFR Markets.“It is no coincidence that policy makers fret over the low volatility environment, given that a sharp reversal would create stability implications and thus complicate their own exit plans.”Across the Atlantic, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.1 per cent while Tokyo put in a far more bullish performance as the Nikkei 225 leapt 2.1 per cent – its biggest one-day gain in a month.In Hong Kong, the index of China enterprise stocks, or “H shares”, rose 1.1 per cent to a five-week high as participants took heart from a stronger than expected HSBC-Markit “flash” manufacturing purchasing managers’ index.The May reading of 49.7, up from 48.1 in April, was the highest for five months and just short of the 50 level that nominally divides contraction from expansion.“Today’s PMI number may be interpreted as a first, tentative sign of growth stabilisation – although this has yet to be confirmed by either soft or hard numbers,” said Nikolaus Keis, economist at UniCredit.“Downside risks to the economy remain, particularly as the property market continues to show signs of pronounced weakness.”Flash PMI surveys in the eurozone were a little more disappointing, however.The composite index inched down to 53.9 in May from 54.0, driven by a 0.9 point drop in the manufacturing index. By contrast, the service PMI edged up to 53.5, the highest level since June 2011.“The divergence might reflect that there is a lagged effect on manufacturing from the slowdown in global growth in the first quarter, where the US and China showed some weakness,” said Pernille Bomholdt Nielsen, analyst at Danske Bank. “The service sector is mostly affected by domestic demand and still looks strong.”Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said the PMIs offered a reminder of the fragility and unevenness of the region’s economic recovery.“With inflation low and a sustained eurozone recovery not yet assured, further European Central Bank easing in June looks all but certain.”Such expectations helped keep the euro on the back foot. The single currency was down 0.2 per cent against the dollar to $1.3655 – leaving it on track for its weakest finish in more than three months.The yen also lost ground against the dollar as the tone in the markets turned more risk-friendly.The dollar was up 0.4 per cent at Y101.79, just a day after briefly dipping below Y101, as the yield on the 10-year US government bond – which moves inversely to its price – rose 2 basis points to 2.56 per cent.The rise in Treasury yields and the dollar came as the latest US data releases proved moderately disappointing.Initial jobless claims rose by 28,000 last week from a six-year low, although this was a smaller increase than expected. The four-week moving average fell by 1,000 to 322,500.“Despite today’s bounce, we’re still seeing a May claims tightening that suggests upside risk for our 220,000 May non-farm payroll forecast,” said Michael Englund at Action Economics.Meanwhile, existing home sales edged higher in April for the first time in five months but again fell short of expectations.“For home sales, the 1.3 per cent April rise and further median price rise suggests improvement into the second quarter from weak first-quarter levels, with ongoing headwinds from financing constraints,” Mr Englund said.In industrial commodities, the improvement in the Chinese manufacturing report helped push the price of LME copper up by 0.6 per cent to $6,875 a tonne while aluminium rose 1.6 per cent to $1,769 a tonne.Gold was up $3 at $1,294 a troy ounce, having earlier touched $1,303.
407;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US manufacturing motors ahead;;"Thursday brought an onslaught of manufacturing and service activity data around the world, which showed a generally improving picture, led by the US and Germany, but with France as the laggard.AmericasUS: Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) showed output rising at the fastest pace for three years, increasing to 56.2 in May from 55.4 in April.“This provides further confirmation that industry will aid a rebound in US GDP in the second quarter, and other indicators from the survey suggest that the sector has plenty of momentum heading into the summer and beyond,” said Paul Smith, senior economist at the financial data company Markit.An increase in the number of new applicants for US jobless benefits last week is not troubling economists.Although initial claims climbed to 326,000, higher than forecast and up from 298,000 the week before, it does not disrupt the improving, longer-term trend in the US labour market.The report, from the labour department, also showed that the total number of continuing claims fell to 2.65m last week, as even more people stopped signing up.The rise in existing US home sales in April fell short of forecasts. But the fact that it was the first this year – and only the second since last summer – has been enough to cheer homebuilders.EuropeEurozone: Germany’s economy is storming ahead, France’s is stuttering, but overall the eurozone is performing well. The Markit composite PMI for May stayed above the 50 level, which signifies growth, with a reading of 53.9 coming in line with expectations and down only slightly on the 54 recorded in the previous month. France’s figure dropped to 49.3 from 50.6 in April.The services sector is performing better (up to 53.5 from 53.1) and manufacturing worse (down to 52.5 from 53.4).Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “Deflationary pressures remain a major issue . . . and the ongoing fall in average prices charged for goods and services adds to the likelihood of the [European Central Bank] taking action to boost the economy at its June meeting.”UK: Manufacturing sector activity stayed solid in May and output is expected to rise strongly in the next three months, according to the CBI employers’ group.The CBI’s latest industrial trends survey of manufacturers shows output volumes are growing at the same rate as the previous two months, with 36 per cent saying they were up over the past three months and 21 per cent saying they were down, for a balance of +15 for the third month in a row.The balance was zero for whether order books were above or below normal, compared with -1 last month, economist expectations of +4 in a Reuters poll, and the long-run average of -16.The CBI said the survey of 437 manufacturers found that total order books remained well above the long-run average.Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, said: “Overall, the manufacturing sector continues to perform well. Output growth is on an upward trend, with firms expecting an even stronger rise in the next three months. Inflationary pressures are under control, with firms now expecting only a slight rise in the selling prices of their goods.”The UK economy expanded 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, confirming a previous estimate. But it was the worse-than-expected snapshot of the budget that was attracting more attention on Thursday.The government had to borrow £11.5bn to cover the gap between revenues and spending in April – £1.9bn more than in the same month a year agoThe biggest reason for the higher deficit in April was a 6.8 per cent drop in income tax receipts. The Office for National Statistics said this might be due to higher earners pushing more of their tax payments into April last year to take advantage of the cut to the top tax rate to 45 per cent.Public sector net debt climbed to £1,270.8bn, equivalent to 75.6 per cent of gross domestic product.Norway: A drop in the number of jobless people pulled the unemployment rate down 0.3 percentage points to 3.3 per cent in the three months to April.The rate of unemployment among immigrants rose to 7.3 per cent in February this year from 6.8 per cent the year before; immigrants made up 47 per cent of the growth in unemployment during that period.Household disposable income increased 1.4 per cent quarter on quarter at the beginning of 2014.AsiaChina: HSBC’s preliminary purchasing managers' index for May, which collates results of a survey questioning factory managers about current business, rose to a five-month high of 49.7.A reading below 50 for this index signifies business is still contracting, but this result was much better than expected, and was driven by a rebound in exports. This was the best PMI performance since December.The survey result came partly from a rebound in new export orders, suggesting that Chinese factories may finally be starting to benefit from a recovery in western consumer demand that has already helped Korean companies.Japan: Manufacturing output hit a two-month high in May, suggesting some stabilisation after the April 1 sales tax increase, but conditions nonetheless continued to contract, according to a private survey.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index rose by half a point to 49.9 – just missing the 50 level marking growth.In April, the reading had dropped sharply, from 53.9 in March to 49.4, breaking a 13-month trend of expansion, as the tax rise reined in business spending."
408;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-22T11:28:52Z;Eurozone recovery eases in May;Business activity in Germany again outpaces France;The eurozone’s manufacturing and services sectors expansion eased slightly in May, as business activity in Germany continued to outpace that of France.Markit’s purchasing managers’ composite index, a survey of business activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to 53.9 in May, down from 54 in April. It remained higher than the crucial 50 mark, however, which denotes an expansion in activity.Manufacturing activity fell to 52.5, lower than April’s reading of 53.4. But, at 53.5, activity in the services sector rose sharply, expanding at its fastest rate in 35 months.“Eurozone recovery is on track. This is the main message coming from the release of today survey data,” said Clemente de Lucia, economist at BNP Paribas.“Activity growth accelerated in the services sector, while it slowed down in the manufacturing. This probably confirms that the recovery is entering a more self-sustaining phase, where the most domestically oriented sectors (services) drive the recovery,” he added.Germany continued to act as the eurozone’s locomotive on the back of increasing business orders across all sectors. Meanwhile, France suffered a setback, as manufacturing and services activity contracted because of slowing demand.“France’s stuttering economic performance continued in May,” said Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit. “With new orders and employment both falling at sharper rates in the latest month, the malaise looks set to persist, dashing hopes of any convincing recovery taking hold.”In spite of France’s disappointing results, gross domestic product in the eurozone is set to rise 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, according to Markit. This rate would be more than twice as fast as the 0.2 per cent increase in the first three months of 2014, which raised concerns among policy makers about the robustness of the recovery.Economists said that the latest data also suggested that the eurozone’s upturn was spread evenly, boosting growth expectations in the bloc’s peripheral countries, which were among the worst hit by the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.“The periphery continues to catch up, especially in the services sector,” said Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit in Milan. “This suggests a steady improvement in domestic demand fundamentals in crisis countries, as the relief from low inflation is increasingly accompanied by signs of labour market recovery.”

410;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-22T10:22:35Z;Cinnober seeks takeover of Boat to reverse profit decline;;Cinnober is planning to reverse a steep decline in profitability by using its proposed takeover of a European trade reporting service as a platform to supply more trading tools to cost-conscious banks.The Swedish group wants to use its potential takeover of Boat as the cornerstone for more outsourced trading operations from banks.Last month Cinnober approached Markit, the UK financial data and technology provider, about taking full control of Boat. Cinnober has provided the core technology for Boat and also fully managed the service since its inception in 2007, but only developed the services it was mandated to provide.“This is something we’re committed to,” Veronica Augustsson, chief executive, told the Financial Times.It is part of a plan to reduce reliance on supplying trading, clearing and surveillance systems for exchanges worldwide. Cinnober has garnered work from exchanges in recent years including Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa, CME Group and the London Metal Exchange. It also recently signed an agreement with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.For the nine months to March 31, Cinnober reported a drop in net sales from SKr216.5m to SKr204.7m while operating profits have narrowed from SKr17m to SKr400,000 as margins have shrunk to near zero, from 7.8 per cent in the same period a year ago.Some of the decline is due to a change in the way it charges customers for its software. However, Cinnober has also acknowledged that its order intake this year has been “too weak” and the company has been working on measures to improve its profitability in recent months.December 2013: Veronica Augustsson, chief of Cinnober, discusses why glitches and downtime in trading systems are becoming more commonBanks, under pressure to cut their technology costs, are increasingly outsourcing parts of their trading infrastructure to third-party providers.“The bank segment is bigger than the exchange one,” Ms Augustsson said. “What we’ve seen over the last couple of years is that banks haven’t done much more internal development. The quality of systems for an exchange is higher than most banks’ internal systems.”If Cinnober took over Boat, customers could continue with their mandatory trade reporting without having to change providers. Markit announced plans to wind down Boat in November just as Bats Chi-X Europe, one of Europe’s largest share trading exchanges, announced its own rival service. That has become the main venue for European trade reporting, with a market share of about 60 per cent.
411;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-11T23:04:06Z;Forty per cent of UK part-timers want longer hours;;About 40 per cent of part-time workers would like to work longer hours, according to a survey, bolstering the argument that there is still slack in the UK labour market.Part-time workers were also more likely than full-time employees to say they were overqualified for their jobs, and that they could work more “without too much effort”, in a survey of 1,000 households by the data provider Markit.More than a third in both groups said their employers could make better use of their abilities.Evidence of “underemployment” has helped policy makers at the Bank of England to argue that interest rates can remain at record low levels for longer without fuelling inflation, even though the headline rate of unemployment has fallen much faster than anticipated.Some economists think the desire to work longer may dissipate as the economy mends and real incomes begin to rise again.With the UK recovery picking up pace, and fears of a house price bubble increasing, many think the BoE could signal a shift towards earlier rate rises when it updates its quarterly forecasts in this week’s inflation report.Workers in retail and construction, and those with the lowest household incomes, were most likely to express a preference for longer hours in Markit’s survey. More than one in four full-time workers said they had too much work to do, with the highest earners and those working in finance and business services most likely to feel this.Public sector workers were more likely to feel overqualified than those in the private sector.
412;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-11T23:03:07Z;London tops UK regional business growth league;;London achieved the fastest growth in business activity last month, while Northern Ireland, previously a weak economy, was the second-best performer, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers’ index.All 12 UK regions continued to record growth, with the overall average at a five-month high. The weakest growth was in Scotland, followed by Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands.The headline index measuring overall business activity was 59.2, up from 57.8 in March, well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The survey was run by Markit, the data company.London’s return to the leading position follows a period in which the capital appeared to slip towards the middle. Employment there rose by only half the national average in the three months to February, according to the Office for National Statistics.Northern Ireland rose to second place in the regional index, having previously been third from bottom. The regional data can be volatile, but there have been other signs of improvement in the province’s fortunes. Employment has grown by 2.8 per cent in the past year, slightly above the average 2.3 per cent UK increase.Tim Hinton, Lloyds’ head of small and medium-sized enterprises, said the “robust increases in output and employment are pointing to a broad-based upturn in business activity nationwide as confidence in the recovery takes hold more widely”.A survey by BDO accountants found that manufacturers’ growth prospects had reached a 22-year high – exceeding the level of optimism in services.
413;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-07T14:50:41Z;US productivity and output fall;;USThe productivity of the US workforce dropped along with the economy’s output in the first three months of the year.A measure of employee output fell 1.7 per cent in the first quarter, according to a report from the Labor Department, steeper than the 1.2 per cent decline economists had forecast.Productivity – a key input for companies when weighing hiring plans – climbed during the final three quarters of 2013.Meanwhile, mortgage applications climbed 5.3 per cent last week, according to the latest index from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), snapping two weeks of declines.It was applications for loans to buy homes that drove the overall index, with demand rising 9 per cent, according to the MBA. Applications to refinance existing mortgages climbed a more modest 2 per cent.The health of America’s housing market is drawing increased scrutiny as it is an area of the economy that is taking longer to emerge from the winter slump that gripped the US economy.EuropeUKThe UK’s car industry trade body has jacked up its 2014 sales estimate to more than 2.4m cars, from 2.3m previously, after April sales rose 8.2 per cent – the 26th straight month of increases, as Henry Foy reports.British car buyers have been the darling of the European car industry over the past two years, as the market swells in contrast to shrinking sales on the continent. So far this year UK car sales are up 12.5 per cent on 2013.Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which collates the data, said: “This marks 26 consecutive months of growth as GDP continues to pick up, inflation falls and wage levels improve“As UK economic confidence improves still further and the market continues its upward trend, we have revised our 2014 forecast up from 2.3 million to over 2.4 million registrations. This represents an increase of more than 6% versus last year.”Asia PacificChinaBusinesses in China’s services industries grew at a slower rate in April than in March, according to HSBC’s purchasing managers’ index and highlighting the government’s challenge to rebalance the slowing economy away from credit-fuelled investment and towards consumption.The PMI slipped to a reading of 51.4 in April, from 51.9 in March.In the survey, any score above 50 indicates expansion.The survey carried out by HSBC and data-gathering partner Markit polls managers in industries such as hotels, catering and telecommunications on topics including new orders and hiring.HSBC economist Qu Hongbin said the survey showed service sector employment at its lowest in seven months, with this sub-index just above the 50 mark.He added that the services sector was “not expanding at a fast enough pace” to offset what a separate HSBC survey has identified as China’s ongoing manufacturing slowdown (official data tells a more positive story).Successive Beijing administrations have aimed for China to derive more of its growth from consumer spending instead of government investment in new infrastructure.But without much of a welfare system, and due to the one-child policy that prompts young people to stash money away to care for ageing parents, China continues to have the world’s highest household savings rate, according to the World Bank.Australian retail sales disappointed in March, though sales rose for an 11th consecutive month.Retail sales expanded by 0.1 per cent in March, missing forecasts for spending to rise 0.4 per cent. The modest gain marks the slowest month of sales growth in the 11-month trend.Consumers continued to spend at restaurants but pulled back their purchases on household goods and clothing.Revisions were mixed. The gain in February was revised up to 0.3 per cent from 0.2 per cent, but January’s 1.2 per cent gain was dropped to 1.1 per cent.JapanMarkit’s Japanese services index indicates April saw the biggest monthly contraction since September 2011, as firms report a slowdown linked to the rise in the national sales tax.The monthly survey of the business activity in the services sector fell a sharp 5.8 points to 46.4 in April from 52.2 in March. A score below 50 indicates contraction.Details weren’t encouraging, as new business declined for the first time in nine months.A separate report on manufacturing also saw the first decline in output in 14 months, leading Markit’s “composite index” of the two sectors to slide to 46.3 from 52.8.Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, laid the blame on the sales tax, which on April 1 was increased from 5 to 8 per cent.The implementation of the sales tax had a damaging effect on the business activity of Japanese service companies, with a solid fall in business activity …Selling prices rose at a record pace, with a number of panellists commenting on the increase in sales tax as the main contributor.The good news: the effect of the tax rate looks to be temporary, as business expectations for the coming 12 months ticked up to its highest level since September.
414;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Quick View: Markit outgrows its shareholders;;"Markit’s upcoming initial public offering will now give the world a better view of what drives this fast-growing UK data provider.Understanding its empire has not always been easy, with $547m spent on seven acquisitions in the two years to December 2013.Consequently it competes on many fronts and its rivals are varied. On Monday Markit itself helpfully named some of them: Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, Factset, IntercontinentalExchange, ICAP’s Traiana, IBM, GoldenSource and perhaps most unusually, Deloitte.Nevertheless, several points emerged from its US filing. Just over 90 per cent of revenues come from either the US or Europe and 95 per cent are from recurring fees, either fixed or variable. It has only $75m of cash on the balance sheet and borrowings of $574m, so little surprise it doesn’t plan to pay dividends.Its information business, which includes pricing and reference data like credit default swaps, indices and valuation and trading services accounts for nearly half of its business. Trade processing for over-the-counter derivatives, foreign exchange and syndicated loans accounts for another 28 per cent and its 52 per cent margins are Markit’s most profitable.However the one question the filing did not really answer was why it is floating. After all, Lance Uggla, chief executive, has long spoken of how he did not need to go public.Markit, in its Markit-ish way, talked bullishly about “capitalising on evolving regulatory environments” and making acquisitions but one wonders how much of that could be done as a private company.It is filing under the US Jobs act but its “emerging growth company” status is likely end in December when it breaches the $1bn revenue limit for a high-growth company. It made $960m in revenues to December 31 and has subsequently bought again, with the £55m thinkFolio purchase in January.Given the lack of new money being raised, it points to existing shareholders wanting to get out, fast. The filing noted that the sweeping banking and markets regulations are creating the need for new compliance and reporting processes, risk management protocols, disclosure requirements and analytics. All well documented.Yet Markit itself may be changing; it is repositioning its trade processing business from a transaction-based confirmation service to a connectivity and regulatory reporting service. Its index business is likely to face increased regulatory scrutiny imposed on administrators of benchmarks too.But those changes could come at a price. As the “risk factor” section noted, Markit could become subject to further direct regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of the “matching” services it provides, since it could be considered as a clearing agency. Its benchmark business could equally come under direct regulation from the European Commission. Both would bring huge new compliance and capital issues. “Such burdens could negatively impact our profitability,” Markit said. Such is life for key market infrastructure providers.It’s too early to tell whether these points are a real threat or stated for transparency to ward off any legal threats in years to come. Even so, it is increasingly difficult for banks to be seen owning the institution that both provides a key market service, and is supposed to serve as its regulator. A looming threat of higher regulatory and compliance costs is enough only accelerates their desire to sell down stakes below their collective and controlling 51 per cent holding. That uneasy feeling may be reciprocal. Markit has ended the rights some bank shareholders had to appoint their own directors to the board, post-listing.One could argue similar factors were at work in the banks’ decision to forsake LCH.Clearnet and selling to the London Stock Exchange Group a year ago. It shows how far Markit has come but now it must sell its story to a new audience."
415;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-06T16:17:11Z;Markit: taking on the Borg;Data provider challenges Bloomberg’s dominance;"Enormous new headquarters can be a symptom of corporate hubris. Consider the fleet of cranes above Bloomberg Place on Cannon Street in London. They are a reflection of Bloomberg LP’s confidence in its financial data empire – and a contemptuous invitation to competitors. Markit plans to accept.Bloomberg’s $20,000-a-year terminals promise access to data of all flavours and an instant-messaging service that is ubiquitous across finance. The price model is, infuriatingly for customers, all-or-nothing: no paying less if you use less.Markit offers niche products and flexible pricing. It surveys bond dealers for pricing of bonds and derivatives. It then sells the aggregated data back to the dealers, who use it to benchmark and confirm trades. Without Markit, dealers in many opaque and complex products would be flying blind.When investors buy Markit’s US initial public offering this year, they will decide if the model merits a high – that is to say, Bloomberg-killing – multiple. The numbers in its IPO filings, issued this week, show that it is hard to lose money selling customers’ own data back to them. Operating profit of $230m last year was supported by $950m of revenue. Half of revenue came from fixed-fee contracts; the rest vary with level of use. The customers seem happy with these arrangements. They renew at a 90 per cent rate.Hubris is a risk for Markit, too. The company’s services have become so integral to derivatives trading that it is the target of class action suits alleging that distortions in its pricing have put some traders at a disadvantage.Markit has grown fast – 15 per cent average annual growth from 2009 to 2013, says Burton-Taylor, a consultant. ( FactSet, a rival, grew 7 per cent.) This may be hard to maintain, given it is already dominant in its niche. No giant-killer yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
416;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-06T15:37:14Z;OECD upgrades UK growth forecasts to 3.2% in 2014;;The OECD upgraded its growth forecasts for the UK on Tuesday as the dominant services sector rose for the 16th straight month, and sterling hit a five and a half year high against the dollar , in a sign of the strengthening the economic recovery.The Paris-based organisation now predicts the UK will grow by 3.2 per cent this year, compared with an OECD average of 2.2 per cent.The upward revision from November’s estimate of 2.4 per cent was the largest upgrade in the G7.However, the UK’s combination of surging economic indicators and rising house prices is focusing attention on how much longer interest rates need to remain at their record low level. The OECD warned that regulators needed to act to prevent excessive house price inflation, noting in its twice-yearly report that UK house prices were already above long-term norms relative to rents and incomes.The latest figures from the unofficial Markit/CIPS service purchasing managers’ survey beat market expectations, rising to 58.7 in April, up from 57.6 in March. The index is now at its highest level in four months. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in activity.Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said that if official data followed the path indicated by the PMI surveys, a rate rise should be coming sooner rather than later.“If you can’t hike with double-digit house price inflation, a near-60 PMI reading and strong labour data, when can you?” he asked.Taken together with good readings in the construction and manufacturing PMIs, the composite PMI survey indicates the UK economy is on track for second-quarter growth of at least 0.8 per cent, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.“Such a rate of growth in the second quarter would lift gross domestic product above its pre-recession peak, extending further the strongest spell of economic growth that the country has seen since the financial crisis struck,” Mr Williamson said.All three surveys showed “buoyant” hiring intentions, Mr Williamson added, noting that this suggested private sector employment was growing at a rate of approximately 100,000 a month. This chimes with the latest quarterly survey of manufacturers from the CBI, which suggested confidence is at its highest level since the early 1970s.Under the second phase of forward guidance the BoE is watching out for signs that slack in the labour market, which allows the economy to grow without generating inflation, is being used up. Of particular focus is the judgment about whether the striking rise in the level of self-employment could be evidence of underemployment, or a long-term trend in a changing jobs market.George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said that while persistent low levels of inflation could buy the BoE more time before having to raise rates, it was important to remember that the BoE is targeting future inflation. Historically, rates have risen on a number of occasions when inflation was at or below target.Predicting the first raise in 2015, Mr Buckley added “the longer GDP growth remains at these rates, the greater the risk that the Bank moves before then”.Respondents to the Markit/CIPS survey reported rising wages were a factor in pushing up costs in some sectors, but Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said they seemed “well contained” across the sector as a whole.“This is likely to reflect the strong growth in the size of the workforce, with an expanding labour supply making it easier for firms to ramp up employment levels without causing wage inflation to spiral upwards,” he said.

A consortium of banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, UBS and Deutsche Bank own 51 per cent of the company, with nearly all of them expected to have a role.The UK company on Monday unveiled the filing made confidentially with US regulators earlier this year. The listing will not involve issuing new shares, but will instead see current investors, including management and employees, reduce their stakes.The banks have been split into groups of two, with each assigned a Premier League football team name and given small tasks, people familiar with the process said. Markit wanted each bank to feel it had an important role and has told them there is a “fractional difference” in the fees they will receive, some of these people said. Markit declined to comment.Markit has also used the IPO process as a way to get banks to pay attention to some of its new products, including those designed to compete with Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg. “This has been an extremely co-ordinated effort on their part to make sure their products are receiving the appropriate attention,” said one person close to the matter.June 2013: Why London was the right location for Canada’s Lance Uggla to launch Markit.An investor roadshow could begin in three weeks. A listing of up to $2bn far surpasses earlier expectations that the company would seek to raise between $500m and $1bn from an IPO.The company is also likely to seek a valuation that far surpasses $5bn, which was the level it reached after Singapore’s wealth fund Temasek took a stake last May.General Atlantic, a US private equity fund, owns about 10 per cent of the company. The remainder is controlled by employees led by founder and chief executive Lance Uggla.The acquisition-hungry company, which has done 25 deals since its inception, reported an increase in revenues for 2013 even though it only did a couple of small deals. Annual turnover rose 10.1 per cent to $948m, driven in part by its loans processing business. Pre-tax profits rose from $196m to $211m.Investors will in time have to determine whether to value the group as a growth stock or on the basis of its steady recurring revenue business, which accounts for half its turnover. The group said it did not plan to pay a dividend.
418;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-02T17:40:14Z;Recovery spreads across eurozone;;The eurozone’s recovery is spreading from the bloc’s core to its periphery, manufacturing data showed on Friday, but businesses are yet to begin hiring in large numbers and unemployment remains close to a record high.A survey of purchasing managers compiled by data company Markit showed factory activity rose in April across all eight of the economies polled for the first time in more than six years.Data on gross domestic product to be published this month are expected to show that the upturn gathered pace in the opening three months of this year. Friday’s PMIs suggest the return to health of the bloc’s economy after two years of financial crisis continued to strengthen in the second quarter.Figures above the 50 mark, which denote an expansion in activity, were recorded in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria and Greece. Their overall reading climbed to a three-month high of 53.4, up from 53 in March and slightly higher than the flash estimate published 10 days ago.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the result “highlights how the recovery is becoming more broad-based and therefore hopefully more sustainable, as rising demand from each member state feeds growth in other countries”.There were signs that the recovery would strengthen, with a separate sub-index for new orders rising across the bloc.“The data should provide the European Central Bank some comfort that the recovery continues to show signs of gradual improvement and track in line with its growth projections [of 1.2 per cent for 2014]. This should allow them to continue to downplay the risk of deflation,” said Nick Matthews, economist at Nomura.Officials from the ECB will gather in Brussels next week to vote on monetary policy. Data this week showed inflation at 0.7 per cent in April, only a third of the ECB’s target of below but close to 2 per cent. However, most analysts do not expect the central bank to cut rates or undertake unconventional policies, such as quantitative easing, at this meeting.Despite evidence that the region’s recovery is becoming entrenched, separate data, also out on Friday, showed unemployment still close to a record high.Figures on Friday from Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics bureau, showed unemployment stuck at 11.8 per cent in March. The rate of joblessness has remained at that level since last December, though it is down from last year’s record of 12 per cent.Disparities persist across the currency bloc, however. The unemployment rate in Spain and Greece is above 25 per cent, while in Germany and Austria only about 5 per cent of those eligible to work are without a job.Dirk Schumacher, economist at Goldman Sachs, said: “Momentum is still too weak to have any meaningful impact on the labour market. But today’s figure provides more evidence that the labour market has stabilised.”“We expect the unemployment rate to remain around this level for the rest of this year,” said Nicola Nobile, an economist at Oxford Economics. “Companies will focus more on deleveraging and restoring profits.”In Germany, the eurozone’s main manufacturer and its largest economy, the PMI rose from 53.7 to 54.1 – the second-highest reading since mid-2011, before the bloc’s economic and financial crisis intensified.The reading for Italy soared to a three-year high of 54.
419;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK housebuilding activity nears 10-year high;;Activity in the UK’s housebuilding sector is close to a 10-year high, according to the latest survey of construction companies.The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index reported on Friday that housebuilding activity has increased for 15 months, the longest sustained rise since 2007.Month-on-month, the figure dipped slightly to 60.8 – down from 62.5 in March– but remains firmly in positive territory. A figure over 50 indicates expansion.The details of the survey point to pressures in the supply chain: companies reported a steep drop in the availability of subcontractors.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said that while output had fallen from the highs seen over the winter, it still looked likely to expand strongly.“Better economic conditions, a surge in housebuilding, improved access to finance and greater investment spending,” would all help boost UK construction growth this year he said.The positive figure comes the day after the manufacturing PMIs also pointed to strong activity in the sector, boosting hopes that UK GDP growth will strengthen in the second quarter of the year from the 0.8 per cent recorded in the first three months.David Nobel, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said housebuilding was the “leading light” in the April figures.“While the rate of growth slowed slightly in April, the construction sector is still experiencing a remarkably strong and consistent period of expansion,” he said.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the improvement in housebuilding figures was particularly welcome because the shortage of properties was a major factor in rising house prices.“Nevertheless, the fact remains that there needs to be extended, very strong house building to make significant inroads into the problem,” he said.
420;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-05-01T09:38:16Z;UK manufacturing activity rising fast;;Activity in Britain’s factories is increasing at the fastest pace for five months as the economy strengthens, according to a poll of manufacturers.The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index – based on a closely watched but unofficial survey of the sector – rose from 55.8 in March to 57.3 in April. Numbers over 50 indicate that activity is increasing.The index reading was the highest in five months and one of the best since 2010, just before UK manufacturing slipped into a double-dip recession. The survey comes after news the economy grew a healthy 0.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year.Sterling jumped to a new five-year high against the dollar on the news. The currency, which had been edging higher ahead of the data release, climbed 0.2 per cent after the numbers, to $1.6905 versus the dollar – the highest since July 2009.Official data earlier in the week also showed a recovery in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a tenth of the UK economy. Manufacturing output rose 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, following an increase of 0.6 per cent in the final quarter of last year.Respondents to the Markit survey said they were busy dealing with new orders, new product launches and work backlogs. New orders came from the UK and from overseas. Activity increased in the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors.Manufacturers increased their workforces for the 12th consecutive month. There was also good news for profit margins as input prices fell and output prices increased.James Knightley, an economist at ING, said the survey suggested manufacturing would continue to contribute significantly to the economy in the second and third quarters. “This is good news for jobs and suggests that our full-year 2014 gross domestic product growth forecast of 3 per cent looks on track,” he added.Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit, said the one “sour point” was a slowdown in new investment goods orders, “a blow to hopes of achieving a rebalancing away from consumer-driven economic expansion”.
421;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-16T23:01:51Z;UK marketing budgets increase at record rate, says survey;;UK companies are ramping up marketing budgets at the fastest pace in at least 14 years, a survey shows.The latest IPA Bellwether survey of UK-based marketing executives also found companies were shifting their spending into high-profile advertising campaigns on traditional media such as television.“The report reveals the most upbeat assessment of business and marketing spend that we have seen since starting the survey back in 2000,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and author of the IPA Bellwether report.About 30 per cent of survey respondents made upwards revisions to their annual marketing budgets in the first quarter, while about 10 per cent revised them lower. The resulting net balance of about 20 per cent was almost double the figure recorded in the previous quarter – representing the biggest increase since the survey began.The surge in optimism among marketers “paints a remarkably buoyant picture for the rest of 2014,” Mr Williamson said.The figures also bode well for the UK economy, as increases in advertising spending are typically accompanied by a corresponding rise in employment and investment.Based on its latest data, the IPA forecasts that advertising spending will grow 4.7 per cent this year in real terms.While the survey respondents increased their budgets for all categories of marketing, from internet advertising to events, they made the largest upward revision to their budgets for traditional forms of media.“This is indicative of a growing confidence and willingness among marketing executives to commit to high-profile campaigns in line with greater optimism over company and industry prospects,” the report said.
422;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-16T17:42:11Z;EM share dividends come of age;;It wasn’t so long ago that being a long-term investor in emerging market stocks came with very little short-term gratification. Dividends were small or non-existent.This is changing fast. The average yield for listed companies in emerging markets is now 2.5 per cent, according to a study by data company Markit. That level is currently slightly higher than average dividend yield of S&P500 companies, which stood at 1.98 per cent on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.Government mandated payouts have been influential in China, Russia and India. The BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries contribute to 60 per cent of total aggregate payout in emerging markets, which Markit expects to reach $238.8bn this year, an increase of 6 per cent compared to last year.While this is robust, the rise in payouts was much greater three years ago. In the chart below FY1 current denotes 2014.Companies in China account for 21 per cent of emerging market dividends alone in total payout terms. Dividend growth in China is expected to slow to 3 per cent this year, way lower than the 20 per cent growth seen last year. Last year’s surge was probably due to the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s stipulation early in 2013 that listed companies should reach a 30 per cent average payout ratio, which is the ratio of a company’s dividend payment to its net profit.The average payout ratio in China is expected to be 30.2 per cent this year, suggesting that most companies are planning to comply with the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s guideline.Chinese companies in some sectors have greater potential for dividend increases than others, says Markit:We believe there is room for higher pay out ratios amongst the health care, retail and real estate sectors, given that many of these companies are currently returning a lower proportion of their earnings to shareholders. We expect further rises in pay out ratios as sectors below the 30% recommended guideline come in line.Of the BRICs, the greatest increase in total dividend payout is likely to be in Brazil, which is set to see payouts rise by 13.6 per cent this year. Payouts in Brazil are expected to total $40bn this year on the back of high expectations for earnings and foreign exchange movement.
423;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-11T09:34:41Z;UK construction suffers as wet weather affects building sites;;UK construction suffered in February as the wet weather took its toll on building sites around the country.Overall, output was down 2.8 per cent compared with January, with falls in both the new work and the repair and maintenance sectors. But year-on-year it was up 2.8 per cent on February 2013.The Office for National Statistics has decided not to designate the UK’s wettest winter since records began as a “ special event”, a one-off event of sufficient magnitude to affect official data. But economists had widely anticipated that the construction sector would be hit by the bad weather.The fall in output chimes with the results of private sector surveys, such as the Markit construction purchasing managers’ index. It fell in February, citing the impact of the weather, but stabilised in March.Construction output makes up about 6.3 per cent of gross domestic product and the weak numbers are likely to bring down GDP growth for the first quarter.Price indices have presented wildly contrasting pictures of the health of the housing market – according to some the boom is back, while to others the slump staggers onAlan Clarke of Scotiabank, said “Even if we get a reasonable bounceback in March, today’s figure should hold back overall growth.”He predicted first-quarter GDP growth of 0.8 per cent, saying gains of 1 per cent now looked unrealistic, unless service sector output was very strong.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey data company Markit, said it was likely the sector rebounded in March “as better weather allows builders to make up for storm and flood-related downtime in February”.“[Construction] therefore likely remains in a period of strong growth, merely damped by the weather at the start of the year, and further robust growth is likely in coming months.Rising business investment will spur further commercial construction activity, while at the same time housebuilders are showing signs of responding to the increased demand for residential property“In particular, rising business investment will spur further commercial construction activity, while at the same time housebuilders are showing signs of responding to the increased demand for residential property.”Despite the dip in monthly figures, sectors of the industry are growing strongly. Driven by a resurgent market, construction of private housing is up by 15.3 per cent on February 2013.The figures also show a growing divergence between private and public sector output. Compared with January 2010, private sector output has increased by 12.3 per cent, while in the public sector it has fallen by 15.4 per cent over the same period.The declining trend in infrastructure continued in Februarys with a 3.7 month on month fall. It is now 23.6 per cent below its December 2011 peak.
424;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-07T01:12:57Z;Vodafone leads way as UK dividends set to hit £91bn;;The UK’s largest quoted companies are expected to pay almost £91bn in dividends this year, an increase of nearly one-fifth on the previous year, according to research from financial information company Markit.The bulk of the rise comes from the Vodafone special dividend as part of the return to shareholders from the sale of the telecom company’s 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless.Regular payouts of ordinary dividends are expected to rise no more than 4.4 per cent to £75.1bn.As companies recovered from the financial crisis and were still cautious about large-scale investment plans or M&A activity, the UK market registered a couple of years of double-digit dividend growth as groups responded to investor pressure for income. But more recently, the rate of increase has slowed.The research forecasts that the biggest increases will come from the banking and housebuilding sectors. Lloyds Banking Group is expected to start paying dividends again and HSBC, consistently one of the UK’s biggest dividend payers, is forecast to increase its payout by 8 per cent.Royal Mail, which made its market debut last autumn, is expected to pay its first dividend in July.Housebuilder Redrow has also started paying dividends again, and Markit also expects Foxtons, the estate agency group, to step up its payments on the back of strong cash flow.Markit says it has seen companies show greater discipline in how they use their capital, especially those in the mining and oil and gas sectors. It cites Shell’s promise to cut capital expenditure and accelerate disposals, and the emphasis on returning cash to shareholders set out by BHP Billiton as it reported first-half results.
425;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-03T09:10:44Z;UK services sector activity slows in March;;Activity in the UK services sector softened slightly in March, but remained firmly in expansionary territory, boosting hopes of strong economic growth in the first quarter of the year.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey registered 57.6 in March, well above the 50 level that indicates no change. But the rate of growth slowed for the fifth month in a row, to its lowest since June 2013.Amit Kara, economist at UBS, said: “The PMI survey is showing clear signs of topping off, but the underlying story remains one of continued strength in output.”Taken together, the three PMI surveys – construction, manufacturing and services – all show the private sector activity continuing to expand in March, albeit at a slower pace than the end of 2013.Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit, said the data suggested first-quarter GDP growth of at least 0.7 per cent, with no signs of a major slow down.“While the rate of growth is slowing, it is doing so merely from an extremely high base,” he said.Mr Williamson pointed that while growth in services had slowed, over the first quarter as a whole, it remained among the strongest seen in the survey’s near two-decade history.Prices charged for services barely rose, as the high level of sterling reduced the costs of imports and companies reported that the lower cost inflation reduced the need to raise charges.Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the outlook for growth remained bright, and the fall “shouldn’t ring too many alarm bells about the strength of the economic recovery”.“Indeed, with credit constraints loosening, confidence rising and the squeeze on households’ real incomes nearly over, we continue to think that GDP is on track to grow by about 3 per cent this year.”
426;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;China bulls urged on by stimulus hopes;;Investors are turning increasingly bullish on Chinese markets, just as they take a more bearish view of the country’s economy. Why? Fund managers are banking on stimulus from Beijing and have piled into financials, railways, and cement stocks to play that theme.The latest data set did little to calm nerves about the economy. A factory survey conducted by Markit showed activity at an eight-month low in March, while official figures showed a stabilisation rather than a rebound in the sector.With the economic picture worsening, calls for a fresh stimulus package are getting louder. Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China needs to “take initiatives” to respond to “downward pressure” on the economy, which many believe will translate into a speeding up of some infrastructure projects.“This does not mean a major, or high-profile, stimulus plan, as these projects are already in China’s medium-term plans,” wrote Louis Kuijs, RBS economist, in a report. “But the call to accelerate them does matter, nonetheless, in terms of what it means for the macro policy stance.”The latest sign of action – state media reports that several Chinese cities may relax restrictions on home purchases that have been used to rein in property prices – gave equities a boost on Wednesday. Hong Kong-listed developers including Agile, KWG and Greenland each rose more than 5 per cent.Some investors are betting on further action so rather than selling on the bad news, they have been buying. Since the middle of March many stocks emblematic of the “old model” of Chinese growth – infrastructure and investment plays – have rallied.“There appears to be a shift in policy to at least support growth at the margin,” says Nick Ferres at Eastspring Investments. “The only way they can support growth is with more investment and more credit. But that conflicts with their longer term goal of managing down debt.”Anhui Conch, the cement maker, has been the biggest gainer on the Hang Seng China Enterprises index in the past two weeks, up by more than a quarter. Its rivals have made similar jumps.Railway stocks – a favourite during previous rounds of stimulus– have also done well. China Railway Group, which builds train lines and highways, has added almost 20 per cent as has rail carriage maker CNR.Financials, coal miners, and energy producers – unloved for much of the past six months – have also surged, alongside automakers. Subsidies for car purchases are yet another common tactic from China’s stimulus playbook.“The rally could be more forceful if they push policy more aggressively,” adds Mr Ferres. “But that would mean bigger problems down the track.”Nevertheless, some analysts believe that, like last year, the government will largely resist the temptation to stimulate and stick to its longer term goal of working down debt and rebalancing the economy.“Unless there is a sharp change in the employment picture then you won’t get a stimulus,” says Andy Rothman, strategist at Matthews Asia.Ethan Qi, a strategist with CEBM, a Shanghai-based advisory group, says there are two basic areas of consensus for investors: that growth is going to slow, and that the government will step in before it slips too far.“But people are getting ahead of the policy shift, so there could be some disappointment in April when they realise that so far the shift has been more one of style than substance,” he says. “The government has been trying to bolster confidence, but we haven’t actually seen a real relaxation of monetary policy yet.”On the contrary, the central bank has steadily drained large amounts of liquidity from financial markets in recent weeks. The seven-day bond repurchase rate, a key gauge of funding costs in China, has nearly doubled from a low this year of 2.2 per cent in early March to 4.2 per cent this week.Similarly, although the government has promised to accelerate its investment timetable, it has yet to announce any spending plans above and beyond the budget announced a month ago.Even without more concrete stimulus measures, Mr Qi says Chinese shares look more attractive than they have in years.After falling more or less consistently since the market peaked in 2007, shares have reached a point where large companies in the domestic market offer dividend yields that are consistent with international norms. Weighted by market capitalisation, the average dividend yield for domestic Chinese shares is now 3.3 per cent.“The core reason that prices are not falling any further is that they are already very low,” Mr Qi says. “Blue chips in China now really offer a decent dividend value.”
427;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-04-01T10:22:32Z;Growth in UK manufacturing activity slows;;Activity in the UK manufacturing sector increased for the 12th consecutive month in March, but the pace slowed notably.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index read 55.3 in March, from 56.2 in February. This was more than a full index point below the market’s expectations of 56.5. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.Despite the disappointing result, the index remains well above its long-run average of 51.4.Rob Dobson at Markit said it was important to take the numbers in the context of the near-record growth levels in the second half of last year, saying “growth is merely hot rather than scorching”.The domestic market remained the main source of contract wins, with new export orders weakening to the slowest pace of growth in 10 months.“We may be still be a consumption-oriented economy in many respects, but at least we now appear to be producing more of the goods we sell ourselves, which is a more sustainable situation to be in,” Mr Dobson said.Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics said the weaker survey reading did little to alter his view that manufacturing would still expand in 2014. He said although the report suggested the “sector’s recovery may have lost some steam over the first quarter, this seems unlikely to herald the beginning of a renewed slowdown”.There was good news in the survey for manufacturing employment, with the rate of jobs growth staying close to last month’s near three-year high. Rob Wood of Berenberg bank said the expansion in employment was a “big vote of confidence in the UK outlook”.He added that it was “extremely unlikely” that the UK was growing as strongly as the surveys had suggested last year, and while manufacturing output is likely to increase this year “the recent survey declines just bring them back into line with a more realistic assessment of Britain’s growth trajectory”.Manufacturing accounts for a tenth of the UK’s economic output but the performance of the sector, particularly its exports, is vital for the government’s ambition to rebalance the UK economy away from consumption and services.The government wants to double UK exports to £1tn by 2020, and Vince Cable, business secretary, would like to raise manufacturing’s share of output “up to the mid-teens” over the next five to 10 years.But the sector was hit exceptionally hard by the crisis, with output remaining about 9 per cent below the pre-crisis peak, compared with 1.4 per cent for overall gross domestic product.Simon Wells of HSBC said while the surveys had fallen off recent highs, conditions remained favourable, but warned there is a long way to go.“It will still be some time before it [manufacturing] reaches 2008 levels despite the recovery in the wider economy,” he said. “The UK may be looking at a lost decade of manufacturing growth.”The Office for Budget Responsibility expects exports to increase by 2.6 per cent this year and by an annual average of below 5 per cent from 2015, less than half the rate needed to reach the chancellor’s target of doubling exports by 2020.
428;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;China and eurozone PMI, Taiwan unemployment data;;Asia PacificChina: The flash PMI from HSBC fell to an eight-month low of 48.1 in March from 48.5 in February. Faster rates of contraction were seen in output, new orders, prices and backlogs of work. “We expect Beijing to launch a series of policy measures to stabilise growth,” said Hongbin Qu, a chief economist at HSBC. “Likely options include lowering entry barriers for private investment, targeted spending on subways, air-cleaning and public housing, and guiding lending rates lower.”Taiwan: Seasonally adjusted unemployment was down 0.02 percentage points to 4.05 per cent as the number of unemployed dropped by 13,000 from January to February. The number of unemployed was, however, 1.7 per cent higher than in February 2013 and was up 0.95 per cent year on year.Industrial production beat expectations, growing at its fastest rate in 13 months. Output was 7 per cent higher in February than the year before, after a contraction of 1.82 per cent in January. While the production of motor and vehicle parts jumped 19.3 per cent year on year and machinery and equipment grew 13.9 per cent, output from the mining sector dropped 10.45 per cent. On a seasonally adjusted basis, production grew at a slower rate of 1.37 per cent, although this was still an improvement after the drop in January.Singapore: Consumer prices slipped down 0.2 per cent month on month in February, though costs remained 1.6 per cent higher than the year before. The biggest year-on-year drop came from transport prices, which dropped 5.6 per cent, while healthcare costs were up 4 per cent.EuropeEurozone: the purchasing managers’ index for March, compiled by Markit, fell slightly to 53.2, from 53.3 last month but remained above 50, marking an expansion in activity. A revival in France, where the PMI hit a two-and-a-half year high of 51.6, drove the bloc’s recovery despite a slowdown in Germany.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the reading for March meant growth in the first quarter was the strongest since the second quarter of 2011.Additional reporting by Claire Jones in Frankfurt
429;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-24T10:07:43Z;French spurt keeps eurozone recovery on track;;A growth revival in France kept the eurozone’s recovery on track in March, according to a poll of purchasing managers which showed the bloc’s economy continues to look stronger than it has done for almost three years.The first estimate for the eurozone’s purchasing managers’ index, an influential gauge of momentum compiled by data company Markit, dipped slightly to 53.2, from 53.3 last month, but remained above the crucial 50 level, which marks an expansion in activity.The PMI for France, the bloc’s second-largest economy, hit a two-and-a-half year high of 51.6, ending months of outright contraction, but a slowdown in Germany, the region’s economic powerhouse, weighed on the regional figure.In France, output and new orders rose by the most since August 2011, while there were signs that the rate of job losses was beginning to ease. The German PMI fell to a three-month low of 55.“The March survey round for Germany was not overwhelming,” said Evelyn Herrmann, economist at BNP Paribas. “The softening in German survey indicators might start to signal somewhat slower growth in the second quarter than in the first. In comparison to the pace of growth, which we suspect could be achieved this quarter, however, this should really not be a reason for concern at this stage.”Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the reading for March meant growth in the first quarter was the strongest since the second quarter of 2011. “The survey is signalling a 0.5 per cent increase in GDP in the first quarter, building on the 0.3 per cent increase seen in the final quarter of last year.”The flash estimate of 53.2 for the eurozone means that activity has risen for nine months in a row, cementing hopes of a recovery after two years of economic and financial crisis.However, unemployment in the bloc remains stuck at a record high of 12 per cent, and Markit reported only a slight rise in recruitment despite the further signs that the recovery is gaining traction.The bloc’s manufacturers, which make up about a fifth of output, continued to lead the recovery, with a separate reading for manufacturing registering 53, compared with a figure of 52.4 for the services sector. Both readings weakened slightly from their February highs.
430;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bargain hunters snap up Russian equities;;Moscow’s confrontation with the west over Crimea has been seized as a buying opportunity by bargain hunting equity investors taking advantage of this month’s steep falls in Russian share prices.Russian equity investment funds and exchange traded funds – which allow investors to buy and sell exposures daily – have seen significant inflows since early March, when Vladimir Putin, Russian president, escalated tensions between Moscow and Kiev.The buying has partly reversed the substantial outflows seen earlier in 2014 as tensions mounted, and suggests investors globally believe the financial impact of sanctions imposed by either side in the conflict will be limited.“The idea – which we don’t necessarily share – seems to be that Russian equities could become attractive if sanctions are perceived as more token and much less stringent than the sort of tough economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran, for example,” said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, strategist at JPMorgan.On March 3, when Russia’s incursion into Crimea threatened to become a regional war, Russian shares dropped almost 11 per cent– the biggest daily fall since the financial crisis of 2008. But they have since recovered some of their losses. The Micex index rose almost 4 per cent on Monday – although it was still more than 11 per cent lower than at the end of February.The rebound suggests investors believed Russian shares had reached a low point – and presented an investment opportunity.Russian equity ETFs saw inflows of more than $340m between March 4 and last Friday, with most of the inflows in the days immediately after Mr Putin first ratcheted up tensions, according to calculations by JPMorgan. The inflows, which followed cumulative outflows of $425m between January 1 and March 3, represented “a big swing in an ETF universe that has a total size of about $2.3bn”, said Mr Panigirtzoglou.ETF flows provide a quick snapshot of investor thinking, although they may reflect tactical shifts rather than longer term investment intentions. But a similar pattern was seen on inflows into Russian equity mutual funds tracked by EPFR, the data provider. Inflows reached almost $60m in the seven-day period ending March 5 and $133m in the following week, throwing into reverse this year’s pattern of continual outflows before the turnround. The weekly inflows were the strongest seen since May last year.Despite the popularity of Russian equities, signs of investor nervousness remain about the stand-off over Crimea. The cost of insuring Russian five-year government debt soared on Monday to the highest since October 2011, according to credit default swap data provided by Markit.Meanwhile, Russian bond funds have seen outflows in recent weeks, according to EPFR data, following steep rises in yields, which move inversely with prices.Commerzbank analysts argued in a research note that Russian bank debt had been particularly badly hit but said the scale of the sell off “does not seem justified by the fundamental risks. We believe current valuations offer attractive levels to re-enter the sector, particularly for investors with a longer term view.”
431;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-09T23:59:11Z;West Midlands leads the way for UK regional growth;;The West Midlands achieved the fastest growth in business activity last month, followed by southeast England and London, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers’ index.All 12 UK regions continued to record growth, though at a slightly slower pace than at the end of last year. The slowest growth was in Scotland, the East Midlands and northeast England.The headline index measuring overall business activity was 58.2, the lowest for eight months but still well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The survey was conducted by data company Markit.Tim Hinton, managing director of SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “An accelerated growth in employment numbers across most regions in February also suggests that companies are becoming more confident that improving economic conditions will be sustained in the months ahead.”Across the UK, a survey of almost 3,000 companies by the Federation of Small Businesses found that a growing number want to create jobs in the next three months.It said there was a marked improvement in the number of businesses gaining access to finance, with more having their applications approved. That was a welcome sign that credit conditions were easing, it added, though the environment remained challenging.It urged George Osborne to focus in his Budget on enterprise, completing the reform of important markets, notably banking and energy, and establishing a supportive tax environment that encouraged small businesses to invest, create jobs and grow.Almost two-thirds of small companies expected to grow in the next 12 months, and one in four planned to increase the amount it invests in its business.The British Chambers of Commerce has upgraded its growth forecasts for the next two years – from 2.7 per cent to 2.8 per cent in 2014 and from 2.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent in 2015New financial services job vacancies in the City rose 11 per cent last month compared with January, but were down 6 per cent year-on-year, said Morgan McKinley, a specialist recruiter.It said the improving market for initial public offerings was a factor fuelling jobs growth. Operational risk managers were also among the categories in demand.“We predict City firms will continue to add to their headcount, particularly within the asset management arena, which has been buoyed by a strong pension fund market, “ said Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services.“However, the impact of turbulence in emerging markets remains to be seen,” he added. “The Ukraine situation could easily create a snowball effect, throwing the financial sector back into the doldrums of the Lehman Brothers days.”He said there was a strong uplift in the short term contract jobs market as City hiring managers tested the water, but they were slower to make permanent appointments.“Companies with high exposure in emerging markets appear the most hesitant to make any imminent increases to their headcount,” Mr Enver said.He added that while some organisations were waiting until the bonus period was completed to start hiring, others were more nervous, especially in light of recent redundancy announcements made by many of the big UK banks.
432;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
433;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-06T10:31:54Z;European Central Bank poised for interest rate decision;;Investors are poised for the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision on Thursday, with economic data out earlier in the week reducing the chances of a cut in the main refinancing rate.But with inflation far below the ECB’s target of close to, or at, 2 per cent, market participants will be listening closely for comments from Mario Draghi, bank president, on what the central bank can do to tackle the disinflationary pressures.A week ago, economists were split on whether the ECB’s 24-member governing council would lower its benchmark main refinancing rate from 0.25 per cent this month, when the central bank is also set to publish its latest forecasts for growth and inflation.Now, most consider a cut on Thursday unlikely after a poll of purchasing managers and retail sales data pointed to a strengthening of the currency bloc’s nascent economic recovery.The decision will be made at 12.45 GMT, with Mr Draghi holding a press conference at 1.30pm.The composite purchasing managers’ index, published on Wednesday, showed activity rising at its fastest rate since before the height of the bloc’s sovereign debt crisis, registering 53.3 in February, well above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity and higher than data firm Markit’s initial estimate.Official retail sales figures released the same day showed the volume of trade in the bloc’s shops rose an impressive 1.6 per cent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, after falling 1.3 per cent in December.Before Wednesday’s data, the chance of a cut by the central bank had already slimmed after official estimates published on Friday showed core inflation, which excludes more volatile prices such as those for food and energy goods, rose in February to 1 per cent while consumer inflation held firm at 0.8 per cent.“Inflation is not weak enough to get consensus around a rate cut,” said Richard Barwell, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.The latest ECB forecasts will reveal officials’ expectations for inflation in 2016 for the first time. But, while the forecasts could well show inflation undershooting the target the year after next, most economists think policy makers for now will respond only by adding liquidity to the banking system.One option would be for the central bank to inject funds by halting the sterilisation of its purchases of government bonds, made through its crisis-fighting securities markets programme.Jacques Cailloux, economist at Nomura, said: “A compromise deal could be around SMP sterilisation.” Unlike rate cuts, stopping sterilisation is likely to win support from Germany’s hawkish Bundesbank.“This [option] would offer some guarantee against the volatility of money market rates seen recently,” Mr Cailloux added. “It also provides some guarantee about how long the ECB would keep liquidity in the system.”The €175bn in liquidity the purchases provide is mopped up once a week by the central bank through an auction where it offers to pay interest on banks’ cash.A minority still expect lower rates. Philippe Gudin de Vallerin, chief European economist at Barclays, said: “We expect the ECB to cut the refinancing rate to 0.1 per cent and to shift the deposit rate into negative territory of -0.1 per cent.”The deposit rate refers to the interest paid on banks’ deposits held at the ECB, with a cut below zero in effect imposing a tax on reserves.“Although recent data on inflation probably make this call more delicate, the medium-term outlook for inflation has continued to deteriorate, with a high risk of inflation remaining below 1 per cent for longer,” Mr Gudin de Vallerin added. “We do not expect the euro area to fall in deflation but we expect a very long period of very low inflation.”
434;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Healthy rise in UK service sector activity;;Positive readings from three influential surveys of UK economic activity suggest the recovery remains on track .Activity levels in the UK service sector in February were unchanged month on month, but continued to show a healthy rate of increase according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers survey.In February the headline business activity index hit 58.2, little changed on January’s 58.3.A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The index has now been in expansionary territory for the past 14 months, although this latest reading is the softest since June 2013.The business expectations component of the survey showed confidence in the outlook for the UK economy at the highest in nearly four-and-a-half years.Unlike Tuesday’s construction PMI, which reported that house building activities had been hit by the record wet weather, the services reading showed little sign of disruption. Some respondents even noted that the relatively mild winter had provided a support to growth.The composite PMI – which combines the manufacturing, construction and services surveys – is now standing at 58.6, which Markit suggests will translate into a quarter of robust economic growth at 0.7 per cent.Pointing to the combination of the three surveys, Barclays’ economist Blerina Uruçi said, “the broad trend remains one of strong positive momentum in activity, supporting our view that the economy will continue to grow at a good pace in 2014.”Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, said: “Most encouraging of all is the record increase in job creation that the three PMI surveys collectively signalled in February.“There’s no end in sight to the good news: with business confidence in the services economy rising further in February, growth should pick up again in March, adding conviction to the growing consensus that the economy is set for its best year of growth since 2007, with the rate easily surpassing the 1.8 per cent expansion seen last year.”Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “Taken together with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the services PMI is consistent on the basis of past relationships with quarterly GDP growth of as much as 1.5 per cent.“Admittedly, it would be unwise to take this reading at face value, as the surveys proved to be far too upbeat in Q3 and Q4. Nonetheless, with business and consumer confidence strengthening, credit constraints loosening and the squeeze on real pay easing, the UK economy should experience another year of robust growth in 2014.”
435;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-04T11:56:58Z;Wet weather hits UK construction activity;;UK construction softened in February as disruption from the wettest winter on record took its toll but, with a 10th consecutive month of increasing activity, a survey index remained close to a six-year high.The Markit construction purchasing managers’ index, based on a survey of construction companies, on Tuesday posted 62.6 in February, from 64.6 in January – a more than six-year high. A figure over 50 indicates expansion.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said the knock to the sector from the wet weather would only be temporary.“Even with that disruption, building output still grew very strongly,” Mr Wood said. “With the housing market booming and business investment rising strongly – a large chunk which goes on buildings – construction growth should pick up as the rain gives way to sun again.”Civil engineering was the best-performing activity in February, with the pace of expansion the steepest since the series began in April 1997. It overtook residential housing, which expanded at the slowest pace for four months.Companies completing the survey reported greater spending from local authorities on capital and maintenance, in some cases responding to the flooding. There were also reports that adverse weather affected some housing projects.David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said Tuesday’s figures were still “exceptionally high”, pointing out the index had been above the survey average level of 54.1 for more than eight months.“The pace of expansion in the sector is stretching resources. The employment index rose above 60, indicating strong growth in jobs. Rates charged by subcontractors also picked up, as their availability fell for the eighth month in a row,” he added.Michael Conroy Harris, construction expert at law firm Eversheds, said that the disruption from the weather could have a silver lining. “Whenever the weather is described as the worst since records began it follows that the construction industry will be significantly impacted,” Mr Conroy Harris said.“There’s no doubt that the flooding will have a short to midterm impact on the industry, but is it necessarily a bad thing? The recovery in the industry has been a long time coming and all the more welcome for that but the last thing we need now is overheating.”Tim Moore, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said: “While some froth has come off overall construction growth in February, the latest data showed that job creation picked up to a pace rarely seen since the summer of 2007. Moreover, in the latest survey there were six construction companies forecasting higher activity over the year ahead for every one anticipating a reduction.”David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “Bad weather took a bite out of progress in house building, but UK construction remains on a strong growth trajectory in February.”He added: “Rising employment and highly positive business expectations also suggest that the slowdown will only be temporary. Backed by favourable market conditions, firms are continuing to increase staff numbers, hitting a three-month high this month.”The data chime with Monday’s manufacturing PMIs, which saw activity increase for the 11th consecutive month.Mr Wood added: “The services PMI tomorrow will be more important for judging near term growth trends, and especially the impact of the flooding. But the underlying picture from the manufacturing and construction PMI’s is of gaining momentum as loose monetary policy increasingly gets traction.”
436;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-03T18:41:16Z;UK manufacturing activity increases for 11th month in a row;;Hopes of a rebound in UK manufacturing have been boosted by a run of positive survey data but flat bank lending, high energy costs and skills shortages are still holding the sector back.The Markit purchasing managers’ index for February saw manufacturing activity increase for the 11th month in a row. But separate figures from the Bank of England revealed only a mild uptick in loans to manufacturing businesses of £100m in January, with the trend over the past year still negative, at -2.2 per cent.By contrast, consumer lending continued to rise, with mortgage approvals hitting a six-year high.Manufacturing accounts for just a tenth of the UK’s economic output, but is vital for the government’s ambition to rebalance the UK economy away from consumption and services.The government wants to double UK exports to £1tn by 2020 and Vince Cable, business secretary, would like to raise manufacturing’s share of output “up to the mid-teens” over the next five to 10 years.But the sector’s output remains about 9 per cent below its pre-crisis peak, while overall GDP is 1.4 per cent below. Other obstacles in the way of a full manufacturing recovery include high energy costs and a chronic skills shortage.Companies and politicians, including Mr Cable, will grapple with the issues on Tuesday at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation’s national manufacturing conference.In an EEF survey, half the 300 companies polled said a government commitment to keep energy costs at, or below, the EU average would be the biggest single incentive for them to expand manufacturing in the UK.The manufacturing PMI hit 56.9 in February, slightly up on the previous month’s 56.6. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. This chimes with a run of recent business surveys which suggest businesses intend for invest this year. It also showed rising employment in the manufacturing sector.Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said: “The strong employment reading is particularly interesting. The structural decline in manufacturing jobs has slowed since 2009. But manufacturing jobs in Q3 2013 were still barely higher than three years previously so we remain a long way off the sector contributing meaningfully to overall job creation.”The car industry is one of the bright spots for UK manufacturing growth, as its output has increased by 50 per cent over the past four years. Britain built more than 1.5m cars in 2013, the first time that figure had been exceeded since 2007, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.On Friday, consultancy Capital Economics suggested the West Midlands and southwest are likely to be the UK’s fast-growing regions due to investment from the car and aerospace industries respectively.Mark Robertshaw, chief executive officer of Morgan Advanced Materials, a company which makes high-tech materials for use in products such as body armour, said manufacturers were starting to feel a “little more optimistic” overall.“Europe is looking slightly better and other parts of the world are stable to slightly positive generally,” said Mr Robertshaw.
437;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-03-03T09:59:06Z;Eurozone manufacturing continues to fuel recovery;PMI dips from January high but shows pick up spreading to periphery;Factory activity in the eurozone expanded for the eighth straight month and, although the pace of recovery slowed from January’s two-and-a-half year high, there were further signs that the improvement in the region’s core was spreading to the periphery.The final estimate of a poll of purchasing managers confirmed that the region’s manufacturers continued to contribute to the currency bloc’s nascent recovery. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data company Markit, hit 53.2 in February, still above the crucial 50 mark that signals growth but below the January high of 54.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The dip in the manufacturing PMI, its first fall for five months, is a disappointment and a reminder of the hesitant nature of the region’s nascent recovery. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is the second-strongest reading that the eurozone has seen for almost three years.”In Italy, the PMI fell slightly, but at 52.3 remained in expansionary territory. The slight fall in the index came on the back of a contraction in activity in France, although at 49.7, the reading was better than the flash estimate of 48.5. In Germany, the bloc’s largest economy, the reading fell to 54.8.In Spain, the bloc’s fourth-largest economy, the PMI edged up to 52.5, up from 52 and the highest level in four years. The numbers bolster Madrid’s claims that the country’s economic recovery is gathering pace, and forecasters recently revised upwards their growth estimates for the current year. “We view today’s release as another piece of positive news: the recovery seems to be gaining traction, in line with our forecast of 1 per cent growth in 2014,” said Victor Echevarria, economist at BNP Paribas.The Markit data were released on the same day as Spain’s association of car manufacturers unveiled an 18 per cent rise in new vehicle sales in February compared to the same month last year.The publication of the PMIs comes ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy vote on Thursday, when most economists expect policy makers to hold interest rates on the back of slightly higher than expected inflation in February.While inflation last month remained at 0.8 per cent, it is still less than half the central bank’s target of just below 2 per cent. The subdued price pressures on Monday sparked fresh calls from Christine Lagarde for the ECB to stop the single currency union from sliding towards deflation.Warning that even a prolonged period of low inflation could “derail the recovery” in the bloc, the IMF managing director told a conference in the Spanish city of Bilbao on Monday: “The ECB has already taken a number of strong measures to help the euro area.” But, she added: “Even further accommodative policies and targeted measures are needed to address low, below-target inflation and achieve lasting growth and jobs.”Ms Lagarde said the IMF believed there was a 15-20 per cent chance of prolonged low inflation in the eurozone.The IMF chief also praised Spain’s recent economic performance: “Spain has turned the corner . . . Financial and economic conditions have improved significantly,” she said. However, she called on the government to deepen its programme of economic reforms, warning that “there can be no let-up in the reform momentum”. She urged it to do more to lower the cost of labour, invest in training the unemployed and make it easier for entrepreneurs to start new businesses.
438;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-25T22:47:27Z;Sector upheaval puts Bloomberg on top;Markit has steadily grown its revenues as industry heavyweights have faltered;The market for financial data has been in a state of upheaval since the turmoil of the financial crisis in 2008 and subsequent job and spending cuts at bank clients.In a business dominated by Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, Markit was a relative newcomer in 2008 with its product that relies on deriving prices and valuations for difficult to obtain financial data as well as processing and risk management of over-the-counter derivatives.Markit generated about $128.8m in worldwide financial market revenues in 2008 – a small amount compared with the $7.9bn captured by Thomson Reuters and the $6.2bn at Bloomberg, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting.Markit has steadily grown its revenues as industry heavyweights such as Thomson Reuters and News Corp’s Dow Jones have faltered. In addition to broader market turmoil, Thomson Reuters has faced challenges after Thomson’s $17bn purchase of Reuters in 2008. The group has lost market share during the past five years and slashed thousands of jobs.Jim Smith, chief executive of Thomson Reuters, recently told the Financial Times that after years of sinking revenues in its Financial & Risk group that it was beginning to hold its own with the success of its new Eikon platform. “I think we’re turning the tide now.”Dow Jones is also in the midst of a shake-up following a disappointing performance in its financial news and data group. Lex Fenwick in January left his post as chief executive after releasing a new DJX product that pushed customers to pay for a single product that analysts said did not meet their needs. The company is in the middle of launching new offerings with more flexibility.But as rivals have attempted to upset Bloomberg’s dominance with new chat functions and other offerings, the company continues to reign. Bloomberg has surpassed Thomson Reuters to become the industry leader. Its worldwide financial markets revenues increased 4.3 per cent in 2013 to $8.2bn while the broader market grew 0.5 per cent, according to Burton-Taylor.
439;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-25T18:57:35Z;Markit fires starting gun on long-awaited IPO;;"Markit, the UK data company that has made a business out of providing transparency to dimly lit corners of financial markets, is about to find itself in the spotlight.By confidentially filing for an initial public offering in New York, it has fired the starting gun on an long-awaited flotation. Markit declined to comment on “rumours or speculation”, but for many observers a listing would provide an insight into whether one of London’s most admired financial start-ups can keep up its past growth rates.Markit, which provides some financial data to the Financial Times, began creating its franchise by providing data on prices and valuations of privately-traded credit derivatives, but has rapidly expanded through acquisition to become a wider financial data group that has made inroads into an industry dominated by Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.Launched by Lance Uggla, a former TD Securities trader, from a shed in 2001 in St Albans, a small city north of London, Markit has 3,000 employees and oversees pricing and valuation of difficult-to-obtain financial data, forecasting risk and processing over-the-counter derivatives – all areas that assumed greater urgency during the financial crisis.Its mooted stock market valuation of more than $5bn would be far below that of Thomson Reuters, with a market capitalisation about five times larger, or Bloomberg, which is privately owned. In Markit’s last published results, to December 2012, it made net profits of $195m on revenues of $860m. Much of that growth has come by acquiring financial technology companies. With a flotation, investors will be able to see to what extent the sprawling empire adds up to a coherent whole.A New York listing for a UK-headquartered company will be another element to a working life spent crossing the Atlantic for Lance Uggla, chief executive of data provider Markit, writes Philip StaffordOver the past decade the enthusiastic 51-year-old has become widely-regarded in the UK technology start-up world as the most high-profile of the three founders of Markit.Continue readingTurning Markit into a clearer story for the outside world has been one of its aims of the past year. Some longtime bank shareholders such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Scotland reduced their stakes when Temasek, the Singaporean wealth fund, bought a 10 per cent stake for $500m last May. The deal-hungry company made no significant acquisitions in 2013. Its board has been slimmed down and a new chief financial officer, Jeff Gooch, promoted. Accounting has been changed to internationally-agreed standards.Today its investors include a consortium of 12 banks and financial institutions, which holds a 51 per cent stake; private equity group General Atlantic has an 11 per cent stake and Temasek. Markit staff own the balance, with Mr Uggla, chief executive, holding about 15 per cent. At a $5bn valuation, Mr Uggla’s stake would be worth $750m.Investors will in time have to decide whether Markit’s value lies in the healthy margins it can charge, whether it is more akin to a growth business, or whether it can be both. Some wonder whether concerns over its growth delayed its IPO plans. According to Burton-Taylor International Consulting, which tracks financial data companies, its data unit grew 10 per cent in 2013 to $258.8m, below its five year growth average of 15 per cent.“I think their year-on-year rate growth in financial data were probably slower than it has been in prior years,” says Douglas Taylor, managing partner at Burton-Taylor, who adds that Markit’s growth rate in the sector over the past five years exceeded its rivals.Markit has in part made its business by charging fees for providing outsourced services such as credit portfolio valuations and over-the-counter swaps trades processing that banks find expensive or dull but are required by regulation.But Markit is not averse to taking on its rivals’ strongest areas. Last year, it joined Thomson Reuters and eight investment banks in an attempt to crack the dominance enjoyed by Bloomberg in instant messaging, the communications tools through which traders exchange daily news, gossip and sentiment.The acquisitions may continue. “Markit is still looking at deals, including in the index space,” says one banker who pointed out that assets such as the Russell Investments business, which includes equity indices, are up for sale.Geographic growth is also on Markit’s agenda. Mr Uggla described Asia as “a region where we see immense opportunity” at the time of the Temasek deal. Kevin Gould, a Markit co-founder, has become head of its Asian business to oversee its expansion.Mr Uggla sees growth opportunities in global regulators’ push for “over-the-counter” (OTC) markets to become more transparent and for banks, asset managers and hedge funds to track risks to their capital more accurately.For example, last October US regulators mandated that more of the vast $700tn swaps market be traded on new electronic marketplaces known as swap execution facilities. In the first 10 days, MarkitSERV, its trade processing business, handled more than $1tn of swaps traded on the venues.However, provision of such services for banks could yet cause problems. Markit has been named part of a European Commission antitrust investigation into the credit default swaps market, along with 13 investment banks and ISDA, the global trade association.The EU has alleged that the insurance-like contracts remained an OTC product – preserving banks’ lucrative role as middlemen – and preventing exchanges from entering the business. After a preliminary investigation, authorities last July informed the parties they had infringed EU antitrust rules.Any guilty parties could face fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover, but the parties are challenging the charges and have been given more time to submit evidence. Some people involved in the case think a decision is unlikely this year, which could reduce the risk of the issue clouding Markit’s IPO plans.If such regulatory and reputational threats loom over Markit’s early months as a public company, however, they could still be a factor in investors’ IPO calculations.www.ft.com/tradingroom"
440;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit founder maintains a transatlantic approach;;A New York listing for a UK-headquartered company will be another element to a working life spent crossing the Atlantic for Lance Uggla, chief executive of data provider Markit, writes Philip Stafford.Over the past decade the enthusiastic 51-year-old has become widely-regarded in the UK technology start-up world as the most high-profile of the three founders of Markit.For many, his company’s rise to a $5bn valuation serves as a posterchild for London’s growing financial technology industry, where many small companies provide key data services to some of the world’s biggest banks.His status was recognised last year as Ernst & Young’s UK Entrepreneur of the Year. The judges noted Mr Uggla was an “impressive individual who has created a strong culture at his company”.Mr Uggla hails from Vancouver, although his relationship with the UK capital runs deep. Having done a postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics, he was also working in the city for Canada’s TD Securities as head of global credit trading when he had the idea for Markit.The company’s early offices were on his property in St Albans, one of the capital’s main commuter towns best known for its Roman remains.Rooms at Markit’s main London headquarters carry names and mementos that point to his Canadian heritage. As a keen skier, he likes to seek out difficult ski slopes in his native land. He also keeps an eye out for the progress of the Vancouver Canucks ice hockey team, although in London he is an avid fan of the Arsenal football team.Yet Mr Uggla, who cites British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the world wide web, as an inspiration, has always looked further afield than London.He has spoken of his ambition for Markit to become the “best of the largest” financial information companies. From credit derivatives pricing, the company’s operations have mushroomed to include economic data and risk analytics Many of those business lines have emerged from the acquisition of companies such as Canada’s QuiC Financial Technologies, which tests market and credit risk tolerance in financial portfolios.Outside work and outdoor sports, he is also a fan of 20th century art.
441;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-24T18:57:21Z;Markit and Virtu race for New York IPOs;Financial technology companies prepare for listing;Two unique financial technology companies are preparing multibillion dollar initial public offerings, with both Markit and Virtu Financial seeking New York listings in the coming months.Markit, the UK-based data provider, is aiming to raise at least $500m and seek a valuation of more than $5bn as early as the second quarter of this year, people familiar with its plans said.At the same time, Virtu, a global proprietary electronic trading company that employs high frequency strategies, is aiming to raise around $300m from a listing that would value it at around $3bn, as it too seeks a market debut around that time, some of these people and others added.Both companies have filed confidentially under a provision of a recent US securities reform act which allows companies with revenues of less than $1bn to keep the process confidential until nearer the time of an IPO.While neither company was founded before the turn of the century and neither is a household name, unlike the larger banks and financial services industry constituents which are their clients and rivals, the planned listings highlight the growing power of technology and data in financial services.An IPO for Markit would come 13 years after its chief executive Lance Uggla founded the company from a barn in St Albans, outside of London. Since then, the company, which is 51 per cent owned by a consortium of 12 banks, has grown to employ more than 3,000 people.Markit’s business relies on deriving prices and valuations for difficult to obtain financial data, as well as processing and risk management of over-the-counter derivatives.Along with Thomson Reuters, the financial data and media company, it has launched an ambitious effort, backed by investment banks, to unseatBloomberg’s dominance in providing chat functions to traders, with the hopes of weaning its rivals’ customers off lucrative terminal contracts.The company is working with Goldman Sachs on the offering and filing. Markit is expected to appoint JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and others for its IPO, which is likely to see existing shareholders reduce their stakes rather than an offering of new stock, people familiar with its plans said.The listing may provide the path for an exit by Temasek, the Singaporean wealth fund that bought 10 per cent of the business for $500m last year, and General Atlantic, the private equity firm that owns 11 per cent. The remainder of the company is controlled by executives and employees.New York-based Virtu is aiming to raise between $250m-$350m from a listing that would make it the first electronic trading business that trades with its own funds to launch an IPO.Goldman Sachs is leading the listing along with JPMorgan Chase and Sandler O’Neill. The banks and Virtu, which is part-owned by Silver Lake Partners, declined to comment.Virtu’s prospectus will provide a rare glimpse into the world of a secretive high-speed trading firm. The company, which employs about 150 people, had earnings of about $275m before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation last year, up from about $240m a year before, one person added.Its listing will be a milestone for Vinny Viola, a West Point graduate and former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, who founded the business in 2002. Virtu’s board includes General John Abizaid, the former commander of the US Central Command, this person added.Mr Viola, presently chief executive, will assume the role of executive chairman upon the listing and Douglas Cifu will take on the chief executive role, one person said. Chris Concannon, a former Nasdaq executive who joined the company in 2009, will become chief operating officer.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford in London
442;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-21T23:06:39Z;Sterling strengthens on shopper resilience;;Sterling rallied after retail sales data from the wettest January on UK records kept fewer consumers from the shops than some had expected.Expecting the worst, investors had kept the pound at a session low $1.6614 versus the dollar but, following the data, the UK currency bounced to $1.6687, a swing of 0.4 per cent.The data from the Office for National Statistics showed that retail sales volumes fell 1.5 per cent in January.Although analysts polled by Reuters in the weeks leading up to the data had suggested a fall of just 1 per cent, the market appeared to be pricing in much worse news as the pound fell in the four previous trading sessions.“Once the decline is looked at in context of the atrocious weather and surprisingly strong rise that had been recorded in December, the underlying trend in the data suggests that a brightening mood among UK households is translating into higher consumer spending,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.By late afternoon trade in London, the pound was up 0.2 per cent on the day at $1.6676 but remained 0.4 per cent down on the week.The dollar was broadly stronger this week as disappointing data from the US and China cast doubt on the strength of global economic recovery.In China, the flash reading of the HSBC/Markit manufacturing PMI fell to a seven-month low of 48.3 in February, a bigger drop than expected, and remaining at the sub-50 level indicating economic contraction in the sector.This measure’s fall last month into contraction territory was one of the chief factors behind the January sell-off, particularly in emerging market stocks and currencies.The reaction this week was mild in comparison. Most EM currencies held up relatively well, although the South African rand, compounded also by domestic mining strikes, fell nearly 2 per cent over the week to R11.0355 against the dollar.China’s weaker data hit commodity currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, which slid 4.6 per cent this week to $1.1477 – weakened also by an unexpectedly large drop in domestic trade data on Wednesday.Some analysts also suggested a large dollar order for an M&A transaction exacerbated the losses.Australia’s dollar fell 0.9 per cent over the week to $0.8951 against its US counterpart while the New Zealand dollar lost 1.1 per cent to $0.8275.The euro was one of the few gainers over the week against the dollar, climbing 0.3 per cent to $1.3735 after weak US manufacturing data. The yen, however, fell 0.6 per cent to Y102.41.
443;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-14T12:25:01Z;UK construction output bounces back;;Strong growth in new homes and commercial buildings helped the UK’s construction output rebound in December, offering signs the industry’s recovery is on track.The Office for National Statistics said on Friday that construction output increased 2 per cent in December compared with the previous month, and by 6.3 per cent compared to December 2012.Initial fourth-quarter figures suggested the industry, which accounts for about 6 per cent of gross domestic product, had unexpectedly contracted. The ONS on Friday though revised its data from a decline of 0.3 per cent to expansion of 0.2 per cent. This revision is unlikely to be big enough to have an effect on the overall estimate for quarterly growth.The growth chimes with other measures of improvement, with the latest unofficial Markit purchasing managers’ index suggesting the construction sector is expanding at its fastest rate since 2007.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The initial estimated fourth- quarter decline was always way out of line with the signals from rampant business surveys, which had shown construction activity surging at its fastest rate since 2007 in the latter half of last year.”Noting that survey respondents pointed to boosts from strong growth in house building, including the Help to Buy and Funding for Lending schemes, Mr Williamson said: “To put the divergence between the official data and the survey evidence in context, the survey data are consistent with growth of well over 2 per cent in the fourth quarter. We therefore suspect there is plenty of scope for this 0.2 per cent growth figure to eventually be revised higher.”Over 2013 as a whole, construction output expanded 1.3 per cent, clawing back some of the losses experienced in 2012 when the sector contracted 7.9 per cent. However, the sector is still substantially down on its pre-crisis peak.Construction output has risen for three consecutive quarters, the longest period of consistent growth since 2010. All sectors, including infrastructure and industrial construction, recorded growth in December, but the biggest changes were driven by private housebuilding, up 5.1 per cent month-on-month.New housing was also behind most of the increase for the year, up 10.4 per cent compared with 0.9 per cent for other new work.A Treasury spokesman said Friday’s figures showed that the government’s long-term economic plan was working, adding: “It is particularly encouraging to see that construction of new housing last year was higher than in any of the past six years.”Robert Wood, chief economist at Berenberg, said: “Construction ended 2013 on a strong note, driven mainly by the surging housing market. With confidence in the economic recovery building, interest rates still low and house prices booming, 2014 should be another strong year for builders.“Though the first quarter may well see sizeable disruption from the weather, output will bounce back in when the weather improves as builders make up for lost time.”
444;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-10T00:03:18Z;Private sector takes off in southwest England despite flooding;;Southwest England was the UK region with the fastest-growing private sector business activity last month despite flooding in Somerset, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers’ index.London, which had shown rapid growth in recent months, slipped back to an eight-month low. Only the East Midlands and northeast England showed slower expansion than the capital.All 12 UK regions and nations saw their economies grow, though at a slightly slower overall pace than in recent months. The headline index measuring overall business activity across the UK was 58.5, the lowest for seven months but still well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.The survey, conducted by the data company Markit, found that both private sector output and employment were growing strongly.After southwest England, the fastest-growing regions were southeast England, the West Midlands and eastern England. Northern Ireland’s business activity expanded at its fastest monthly rate for nearly 10 years. Growth in Scotland picked up, while Wales was steady.Tim Hinton, managing director of SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “Growth in business activity across England and Wales has continued into 2014, with momentum only dropping off slightly from the final quarter of last year.“There are also signs that confidence in the economic outlook is on the rise among businesses. This positive sentiment will be a key factor in spurring investment and recruitment over the year ahead, which will support the ongoing economic recovery.”
445;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-02-05T14:37:58Z;Eurozone boosted by hum of services sector;;Activity in the eurozone’s economy rose at its fastest pace for two-and-a-half years in January, according to a poll of purchasing managers that will boost hopes that the region’s nascent recovery is gaining traction.The composite purchasing managers’ index, a closely watched gauge of momentum compiled by data firm Markit, rose to 52.9 last month, up from 52.1 and well above the crucial 50 score that marks an expansion in activity. Although the final PMI is slightly below the earlier flash estimate of 53.2, it is still the highest reading since June 2011, with activity lifted by the strong performance of the region’s factories.The final reading for the bloc’s services companies, which account for the majority of the eurozone’s economic output, was 51.6 – worse than the flash estimate of 51.9 but still a marked improvement on the December reading of 51.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the reading signalled “a very encouraging start to the year”.The final reading came as separate data from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, showed that retail sales dropped 1.6 per cent seasonally adjusted in December from the previous month.Household spending has remained weak despite the currency bloc’s emergence from recession as wages have been stagnant and unemployment remained close to record highs. Recent consumer surveys suggest confidence is slowly returning, but economists are sceptical that spending will improve rapidly. They are also watching closely to see whether falling inflation will encourage spending due to better purchasing power, or whether consumers will hold off, expecting price deceleration to continue further.German companies provided most of the lift to activity, with the reading for the bloc’s largest economy registering a two-and-a-half year high of 55.5. There were signs that the upturn was beginning to flow through to the eurozone periphery, with the PMI for Spain hitting 54.8 – its highest level in six-and-a-half years.Sub indices for employment in Germany and Spain showed companies in both economies were hiring. Across the bloc, employment stabilised after months of decline. Mr Williamson said: “Hopefully we will now soon see companies start to generate new jobs in significant enough numbers to bring down the region’s unemployment rate in coming months, which will perhaps represent the true start of the economic recovery for many people.” At 12 per cent, unemployment in the region remains close to record highs.In France the PMI rose to a three-month high of 48.9, up from 47.3 in December. However, services companies in the bloc’s second-largest economy continued to shed workers and new business orders fell, suggesting activity could remain weak in the months ahead. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: “All in all, there was little sign of the sector shaking off its torpor, as highlighted by firms’ confidence remaining at a historically low level.”In recent months, the French PMI readings have shown the economy to be weaker than suggested by official data.
446;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK services activity slows in January;;Activity in the dominant UK services sector fell back slightly in January, with new business activity at its lowest level in eight months.The purchasing managers’ index for the sector, compiled by data company Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing & Supply, came in slightly below expectations at 58.3, down from 58.8 in December and the lowest reading for seven months. Economists had forecast a reading of 59.2.Although this means activity has now weakened for three months in succession, it is still comfortably above the 50 mark that indicates expansion.Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said the fall was disappointing, given expectations of a stable reading, but noted: “I would stress that 58.3 is a very elevated level. Today’s decline represents a cooling off rather than a seizing up in the sector.”The survey, which polls a panel of purchasing managers across the UK, warns that capacity is coming under pressure with backloads of work increasing for a 10th successive month. This is the highest rate of increase since May 1997.Business confidence stood at its highest level since March 2010, with panellists planning to increase hiring and investment over the next year.Markit’s January construction and all-sector PMI figures also indicated a cooling of activity, but combined, the surveys suggest a stronger rate of expansion in the UK economy than the latest official GDP numbers from the Office for National Statistics.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “A slowing in quarterly GDP growth to 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter contrasted with a more buoyant PMI signal of at least 1 per cent growth, which means interpretation of recent GDP implied growth rates from the PMI is more uncertain than usual.”Commenting specifically on the service numbers, Mr Williamson added: “The service sector saw another month of strong growth in January, suggesting that the UK economy continues to recover at a rapid pace. Although the pace of expansion slowed, we must remember that growth was exceptionally strong in previous months, and also that parts of the country saw record rainfall in January.”The service sector accounts for approximately 78 per cent of the UK economy.David Noble, chief executive at CIPS, said: “The surge in demand resulted in backlogs of work escalating at the sharpest rate in over 16 years. As a result, capacity is continually being tested and firms have sought to recruit skilled candidates, with employment levels rising for the 13th month in a row.”Some economists were bullish about the prospects for growth. Rob Wood, of Berenberg, said the decline in the services PMI was little surprise and no cause for worry. He predicted GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for the first quarter.“Combined with a manufacturing PMI way above past averages and an outright booming construction sector, today’s services reading signals continued strong growth,” he said. “Monetary policy is getting traction, employment is booming and the UK’s main trading partner is moving further into expansionary territory.”
447;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;China factory output slows in January;;Improving factory activity in other parts of Asia has yet to boost production in China, according to a manufacturing survey released on Thursday.The unofficial purchasing managers’ index, compiled by HSBC and Markit, showed a weak start to the year in Chinese manufacturing.The gauge dropped from 50.5 in December to 49.5 in January, a slight downward revision from the 49.6 reported in the “flash” PMI last week. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The January figure marks the first contraction in the sector for six months.According to the survey, manufacturers also shed staff in January at the swiftest pace since March 2009 – the height of the economic fallout following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The official PMI data for January, which often differ from the HSBC figures, are scheduled to be released on Saturday.Millions of factory workers have already downed tools ahead of China’s main national holiday – spring festival – which begins on Friday.“A soft start to China’s manufacturing sectors in 2014, is partly due to weaker new export orders and slower domestic business activities during January,” wrote Qu Hongbin, HSBC’s China economist, in a statement accompanying the release.Zhang Zhiwei, economist at Nomura, said the weakness in manufacturing was tied to the growing problems in the shadow banking sector, which many companies rely on for financing.“This [data set] confirms that economic momentum is slowing. The negative impact of tighter liquidity conditions and higher risk premiums in the trust sector seems to be coming through on the real economy,” he wrote in a report.Fears about the health of China’s financial system have heightened this month, due to the rising possibility of a high profile default in the trust loan sector – a key source of credit in the economy, and the largest slice of the shadow banking system.The poor Chinese data contrast with a brightening export picture in neighbouring Taiwan and South Korea. On Wednesday, South Korea recorded its fastest pace of growth in industrial production for more than four years, while Taiwan’s economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter. Both were boosted by an improvement in export orders.The Australian dollar – often seen by investors as a proxy for Chinese growth – fell 0.5 per cent following the data release to A$0.87 per US dollar. The Hang Seng equity index in Hong Kong dropped 0.6 per cent, in line with a broader global sell-off following the Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday.
448;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-27T00:35:40Z;Fading fear of job security reflects UK unemployment fall;;Fears over job security have fallen to a record low this month, according to a survey published on Monday, reflecting the country’s drop in unemployment.Markit’s index of household finances also showed less gloom over household finances. The index, which measures perceptions of financial wellbeing, rose to 41.5 in January – the joint-highest level in five years. But it was still below the 50 figure that marks an improvement in conditions.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the survey showed “some light at the end of the tunnel for UK households.” Though worries about job security were at their lowest for five years, “households continue to register only a marginal rise in income from employment, suggesting that lower inflation perceptions played a greater role than pay trends in reducing the overall squeeze on finances during January,” he said.Deloitte, the professional services firm, blamed the weak wage growth for a fall in its separate measure of consumer confidence. Its consumer tracker, also published on Monday, found a net balance of sentiment falling to -11 from -8 in the third quarter.Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the dip highlighted the uneven nature of the recovery. “We think this is a setback rather than a longer-term, underlying decline in confidence. Consumer sentiment is higher than it was a year ago and an accelerating economy and lower inflation should bolster consumer incomes in 2014,” he said.
449;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK marketers poised for boom in spending;;UK marketing spend is poised to boom in 2014, according to a closely watched industry barometer.The latest IPA Bellwether survey of 300 UK-based marketing executives found that 39 per cent of respondents planned to increase their spending in 2014, while only 13 per cent planned to cut their budgets – the lowest proportion since the survey began in 2000.That means that the “net balance” of companies expecting to increase spending on advertising and marketing this year is 26 per cent, the most optimistic reading since 2008.“This is a very optimistic looking picture for 2014,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and author of the Bellwether report.Mr Williamson added that the results boded well for the broader economy, because “when companies are loosening their purse strings on marketing, it’s usually accompanied by increased employment and investment”.However, marketers’ budgets are not set in stone. Back in 2008, marketers started the year with great optimism but proceeded to slash their budgets as the economy slowed and the financial crisis began.Using economic growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, Markit has calculated that UK marketing spend is likely to increase 3.3 per cent in real terms in 2014.The survey found that over the last quarter of 2013, marketers had increased their budgets for internet, events and direct marketing, but had cut in areas such as PR and market research.About 43 per cent of the survey panel said they were growing more confident about industry financial prospects.
450;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-07T00:05:50Z;UK services set for strong 2014;;Economists on Monday shrugged off a fall in an important gauge of activity in the dominant services sector to a six-month low as polls showed businesses were confident the recovery would strengthen in 2014.Though activity in the UK’s services sector continued to expand sharply last month, the pace of growth fell back slightly and was poorer than economists expected. The services purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing & Supply, came in at 58.8 for December, down from 60 and the lowest score since June. But it was still well above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity and the series average.Economists had forecast a reading of 59.5. Yet, despite the lower reading, the mood of optimism on the UK economy prevailed.“If you knew nothing else, 58.8 is a stonkingly good number still,” said Alan Clarke of Scotiabank. “If the survey doesn’t continue to fall, then people (us included) are going to have to revise their forecasts up. So it’s a case of down, but nowhere near out.”Separately, a survey of almost 8,000 businesses by the British Chambers of Commerce pointed to improvement in the services and manufacturing sectors, which together account for about 90 per cent of output. The quarterly poll of business confidence, conducted between November and early December, showed five key manufacturing balances were at an all-time high towards the end of 2013, including indicators for domestic orders and employment expectations.Manufacturers’ confidence that turnover would improve rose to a record level of 67. The same reading for services hit 60 – the highest score since 1997. Services trade performed well, manufacturing exports less so.“[The upbeat results] suggest that the UK recovery will continue to strengthen further in the short term,” said David Kern, BCC chief economist. “Strong export and investment balances in our survey confirm that business is ready to play a key role in rebalancing the economy, but the government and the [Bank of England’s] Monetary Policy Committee must create the necessary conditions for this to happen.”Meanwhile, an Institute of Directors poll of more than 800 of its members showed almost nine out of 10 believed growth would be higher this year than in 2013.Confidence among purchasing managers rose to its highest level in four years, while the PMI sub index for new business orders stayed strong, suggesting services activity will stay strong. “The average new business growth rate in the final quarter of 2013 was the best in the survey’s history, suggesting a very bright outlook for 2014,” said David Noble, CIPS chief executive.Mr Noble added: “The stronger positive outlook also offers a platform for investment and expansion in new products and marketing, sustaining the continued broad-based recovery in the new year.”Backlogs of work rose for the ninth month in a row. The employment index was above 50 for the 12th straight month, suggesting companies continued to hire more staff.
451;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-06T14:45:50Z;Spanish companies are upbeat about economic recovery;;Spanish companies are becoming more bullish over the pace of economic recovery, with a poll of managers in the services industry showing the sharpest pick-up in activity and new orders in more than six years.The Markit index for business activity in Spain’s services sector rose from 51.5 in November to 54.2 last month, the biggest leap since July 2007. December was the fifth successive month in which the services industry reported an increase in business, suggesting that recovery is spreading from the export industry and manufacturing to more domestically focused businesses.“What we are seeing here is some lift in consumer and household spending, but also that companies are now more comfortable about taking on new staff, bringing out new products and spending more on things such as advertising,” said Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist.He added that Spain’s economic recovery was driven by growth in export markets such as Germany and by Madrid’s recent efforts to hold down wages and bolster competitiveness.“Unit labour costs have come down sharply and this is feeding through into all economic sectors. It bodes well for the coming years,” Mr Williamson added.Antonio García Pascual, chief euro area economist at Barclays, said the latest data were encouraging but saw no need to lift his growth prediction for this year, which foresees a rise in output of about 1 per cent. “A stronger recovery can only happen if there is a strong rebound in investment and employment but you don’t see that because credit is weak and leverage is still high,” he said, adding that Spain was likely to see only a “mild recovery”.The economy returned to growth in the third quarter last year, ending more than two years of harsh recession. Most economists believe the acute phase of Spain’s financial crisis has passed, but argue that the economic debris created by the bursting of the housing bubble will linger for many years to come. Government debt is close to 100 per cent of gross domestic product, while unemployment remains stuck at more than 25 per cent of the workforce, one of the highest jobless rates in the western world.The government of Mariano Rajoy believes national output will grow by 0.7 per cent this year, but some ministers have suggested recently that the recovery could be more pronounced than anticipated. Madrid’s newfound confidence was further bolstered on Friday, when official data showed the sharpest drop in registered unemployment ever recorded in December.Speaking last week, Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, said he expected stronger job creation this year than previously forecast by the government. “2014 will see net creation of jobs, higher even than we predicted in September in the budget, and the jobless rate will fall,” he told Spanish radio.The sharp bounce in the Spanish services PMI revealed on Monday mirrored a broader improvement in business activity across the eurozone. Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index rose from 51.7 in November to 52.1 last month, while the euro-wide index for the services sector dipped slightly but remained above 50, the threshold that implies expansion.
452;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-06T10:11:39Z;Eurozone business activity rebounds in December;;Activity in the eurozone’s economy rebounded in December, accelerating at a pace close to levels last seen in mid-2011, according to a poll of purchasing managers compiled by Markit, the data company, and published on Monday.The composite purchasing managers’ index was confirmed at 52.1 for last month, up from 51.7 in November.The region was boosted by a strong showing from its factories, where activity rose at its sharpest rate for two-and-a-half years. The dominant service sector ended 2013 with a slight rise in activity, with its PMI dipping to 51, down from 51.2 – and a four-month low – but still above the crucial level of 50, which signals an expansion in activity.The strong readings over recent months suggest the eurozone’s recovery gained momentum in the final quarter of the year, following a slowdown in the third quarter.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, noted that December saw the second-largest increase in business activity since June 2011 and rounded off the best quarter for two-and-a-half years.“Although [the PMIs are] consistent with a mere 0.2 per cent expansion of GDP during the final quarter, the PMI signalled a strong turnround in the health of the economy during the course of 2013, and stronger growth looks likely for the first quarter of 2014,” Mr Williamson said.The figure for the services sector, also published on Monday, is in line with a flash estimate released in mid December.The gap between the region’s largest economy, Germany, and its closest rival, France, remained wide. The PMI for the bloc’s economic powerhouse came in at 55, compared with a reading of 47.3 for France – a seven-month low. Some economists though have cautioned that the French PMIs paint an overly bleak picture that fails to chime with other data.Italy’s reading rose slightly to 50, but signalled activity remained weak in the eurozone’s third-largest economy. Spain performed better, with activity rising at its fastest pace in six-and-a-half years. The Spanish PMI registered 53.9.Despite the trend towards disinflation in the currency bloc, input prices rose for the seventh month running. The pace of inflation eased, however. Many businesses were unable to pass on these rising costs to their customers because of weak demand.
453;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-03T11:42:15Z;Construction data show sector on firmer footing;;The UK’s construction sector ended 2013 on a high, with the strength of the housing market and a rise in activity fuelling hopes that the industry can build on the foundations laid over the past 12 months in 2014.A poll of purchasing managers published on Friday showed activity in the sector, which has seen output plunge 16 per cent since the crash, continued to rise at a fast pace in December. The index, a gauge of momentum compiled by data company Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing & Supply, remained close to the six-year high seen in November.The release of the PMI came hours after Nationwide, the UK’s biggest building society, said house prices were up 8.4 per cent in the year to December, while Bank of England figures showed mortgage approvals at their highest level since the beginning of 2008.The PMI declined slightly, from 62.6 to 62.1, but still soared above the crucial 50 score, which marks an expansion in activity. The industry was optimistic that the sector would gain more ground over 2014, with 57 per cent of purchasing managers expecting growth against 10 per cent who expected a decline.While activity in the housing sector continued to provide most of the impetus for growth, activity in the more troubled commercial sector rose at its fastest pace since August 2007, suggesting that the industry’s recovery has become more broadly based.“Construction companies enter 2014 with the wind in their sails,” said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. “Most encouragingly, the improving UK economic outlook is helping boost private sector spending patterns, meaning that the construction recovery has started to broaden out from housing demand and infrastructure projects to include strong growth in commercial building work.”Nationwide’s house price index showed prices had risen 1.4 per cent in December alone, though they remained around 5 per cent below their 2007 peak.Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the housing market’s recovery outside of London was strengthening. “For the second successive quarter, all 13 UK regions saw positive annual house price growth, though London and the southeast continued to record the strongest pace of growth.”Mr Gardner said part of the reason for the rise in prices was that the supply side had not kept pace with the uptick in demand.Separately, the Bank of England’s figures for mortgage approvals soared above 70,000 for the first time in almost six years, rising to 70,758 from 68,029 in October.Lending secured on homes had risen by £900m in November to £1.273tn. The figure has been increasing steadily since the summer.
454;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-02T19:59:19Z;Growth in manufacturing activity fuels global recovery hopes;;The world’s factories roared into life towards the end of 2013 as manufacturing activity delivered its fastest growth in almost three years, fuelling hopes that the global recovery will accelerate this year.Polls of purchasing managers from Asia to Europe and the US revealed strong growth in factory activity and employment in December. Businesses round the world also expressed confidence that conditions would stay strong in the months ahead, signalling 2014 could be the year when the global economy returns to health after the ravages of the financial crisis.Economists said the global purchasing managers’ index, compiled by JPMorgan and Markit and published on Thursday, suggested the foundations for a sustainable recovery were being laid.“When you look at the level of the new orders index that gives an encouraging signal that the pick-up in activity is going to stay strong,” said David Hensley, director of global economics at JPMorgan Chase Bank. Other data released towards the end of last year also pointed to a rise in demand, he said.Though worrying signs had emerged in the third quarter of last year that the recovery was flagging, the global purchasing managers’ index for December rose to its highest reading since April 2011 at 53.3 last month, up from 53.1 in November. A score above 50 marks an expansion in activity.Managers reported a slight slowdown in the growth of all new orders, following November’s two-and-a-half year high. Yet there were signs that global trade was on the rebound, with export orders rising for the sixth month in a row. Jobs were also added at the fastest rate in two and a half years.In the US, the world’s largest economy, manufacturing activity continued to expand at a brisk pace. The Institute for Supply Management’s poll of purchasing managers came in at 57. Although slightly below November’s two-and-a-half year high of 57.3, the result is in line with economists’ expectations, and is still well above the threshold that indicates growth.Even more encouraging was news that US manufacturers are hiring workers at the fastest rate since June 2011, while new orders soared to levels not seen since early 2010. The figures suggest that the manufacturing sector – which accounts for 12 per cent of economic activity – will gain in strength.When you look at the level of the new orders index that gives an encouraging signal that the pick-up in activity is going to stay strongAcross the Atlantic, the eurozone is also showing signs of recovery with factory activity rising at its fastest pace in two and a half years. After years of crisis, the recovery appears to be gaining ground in the periphery’s largest economies, Italy and Spain. Unemployment fell in Spain by 107,000 in December, the biggest monthly fall since data series began 16 years ago.Germany’s reading hit a 30-month high of 54.3, while the PMI for Italy, the region’s third-largest economy, bounced from 51.4 to 53.3 – also the highest level since the middle of 2011. Greece registered its highest score in almost four and a half years, though at 49.6 it continues to show a fall in activity.Not all the news was good from Europe, however, with France falling to a seven-month low of 47. However, with official data and strong car sales figures painting a much cheerier picture of the euro area’s second-largest economy, economists have cautioned the French PMI could be overstating the scale of the country’s woes.Manufacturing activity in the UK continued to grow at a fast pace in December, though momentum slipped slightly from the previous month.Britain’s purchasing managers’ index, produced by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, hit 57.3, down from 58.1 in November but still close to its high.Additional reporting by Anjli Raval in New York
455;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-02T14:51:39Z;PMI indicators raise worries over French economy;;Is France now the ‘sick man’ of the eurozone economy?The latest manufacturing indicators from the data company Markit released on Thursday showed France, the eurozone’s second-biggest economy, lagging well behind its partners in an otherwise encouraging recovery in the single currency area.While Germany, Italy and Spain showed marked expansion in factory output in December, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index for France showed a decline to a seven-month low.It stood at 47, three points below the 50 level that marks expansion and well behind the 52.7 result for the eurozone as a whole. The figures most starkly underlined the divergence in performance between France and Germany, which stood at 53.4.“France is seeing a steepening downturn, in part the result of widening export losses,” commented Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist. “This suggests that competitiveness is a key issue which the French manufacturing sector needs to address to catch up with its peers.”On the face of it, the Markit figures, which confirmed preliminary readings published in mid-December, backed a brutal verdict from the Lisbon Council think tank last month that “France is the real sick man of Europe”.Few argue with the notion that France still has a distance to travel in undertaking structural reforms in areas such as public spending and the labour market to reinvigorate a sclerotic economy.“One major reason why France now sticks out as the real problem of Europe is that most of the usual euro crisis countries have improved so much,” said the Lisbon Council.But there is some head-scratching over the scale of the gap with peer countries shown by Markit’s readings. These have been out of kilter with other surveys in recent months.In its December manufacturing indicators, Insee, the French national statistics institute, reported a two point improvement on its scale, with output rising two points to hit the long-term average of 100.On Thursday, figures for new car sales in France showed a marked uptick in December of 9.4 per cent over the same month a year ago. The two big French carmakers benefited, with Renault sales up 38 per cent and even those for struggling PSA Peugeot Citroën up more than 10 per cent.“The disconnect between the Markit PMIs and the national surveys is a bit puzzling,” says Tullia Bucco, economist at UniCredit Research.Both Insee and the Bank of France have reported an accelerating rate of recovery in the wider economy as the year turned – albeit at a modest rate. They forecast fourth-quarter growth of 0.4 to 0.5 per cent, with the recovery continuing this year.A number of economists have remarked that Markit PMIs have tended to underestimate activity in France recently. “Obviously you cannot ignore them completely, but you need to balance them against other information,” says Ms Bucco. “I expect the French recovery to continue to unfold.”Part of the puzzle about French performance may be explained by the fact that the economy did not reverse as dramatically during the crisis as some other eurozone countries and so is rebounding less dramatically.A recent Insee study of corporate investment made this point, saying that although investment declined by 1.8 per cent in 2013, overall it had held up better than in other eurozone economies since 2008 – and was likely to show a modest recovery in 2014 as the overall economy shifted back into growth.But whatever the divergence may be in the latest indicators, even the rosiest forecasts only see overall growth in France this year of around 1 per cent. Some expect less than half that.It is this sluggishness in a country that is one of the main engines of the eurozone economy that has prompted the European Commission and other international institutions – not to mention a chorus of private sector economists – to urge bolder reforms on President François Hollande and his socialist government.“French aversion to reforms and its politics are indeed a serious tail risk for Europe,” warned the Lisbon Council.
456;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-02T10:20:44Z;UK manufacturing activity remains strong;;Manufacturing activity in the UK continued to grow at a fast pace in December, though momentum slipped slightly from the previous month.The purchasing managers’ index, produced by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, hit 57.3, down from 58.1 in November but still far above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “The survey provides another indication that the economic recovery is the product of more than just an unsustainable boom in household spending.”Sub indices for employment and new orders suggested activity would remain strong in the months ahead, though the pace of recovery could slacken a little.David Noble, chief executive of the CIPS, said: “UK manufacturing ended 2013 on a high and with all signs of powering ahead into 2014. The rate of production and new order growth remained well above the long-run survey average, rounding off the best overall quarterly performance for the PMI since the opening quarter of 2011.”The reading for new orders fell back from November’s high of 63.9, but remained above 60. An employment reading of 54.4 showed manufacturers were continuing to add more jobs.Though export orders fell slightly, manufacturers participating in the poll reported rising demand from some of the largest emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Russia, as well as from historically significant trading partners Ireland and the USA.
457;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2014-01-02T09:54:04Z;Eurozone manufacturing ends year on a high;Data fuel hopes recovery gathering pace despite French weakness;Factory activity in the eurozone rose at its fastest pace in two and a half years in December, an influential poll of the currency bloc’s purchasing managers published on Thursday confirmed.The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, produced by data company Markit, hit 52.7, up from 51.6 in November and above the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.The uptick will fuel hopes that the eurozone’s recovery is gathering momentum after growth slowed in the third quarter, and gaining ground in the periphery’s largest economies, Italy and Spain.In Greece, the reading was the highest in almost four-and-a-half years, though at 49.6 it continues to show a fall in activity.“A strengthening upturn in the manufacturing sector is helping the euro area recovery become firmly established,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said. “With producers reporting further growth of new orders, exports and backlogs of work, the stage is set for a good start to 2014, during which it seems likely that the manufacturing sector will help drive a meaningful, albeit still modest, recovery in the wider economy.”The German reading hit a 30-month high of 54.3, while the PMI for Italy, the region’s third-largest economy, bounced from 51.4 to 53.3 – also the highest level since the middle of 2011. In Spain, the PMI edged over the 50 mark, registering a two-month high of 50.8.François Cabau, economist at Barclays, said: “It is good news that the Spanish December PMI corrected up from last month’s drop, suggesting that it was a blip related to monthly data volatility.”But manufacturers in France continued to struggle, with its reading of 47 the lowest in seven months and well into contradictory territory. However, the French PMI could be overestimating the scale of the country’s woes.Separate releases of official data in recent weeks, along with strong car sales figures, also released on Thursday, suggested the region’s second-largest economy was doing better than the PMIs imply.Evelyn Herrmann, eurozone economist at BNP Paribas, said: “French PMIs tend to overstate the economic weakness. Other French surveys from the Banque de France and Insee [National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies] had a better track record recently and signal that the manufacturing sector is actually doing better than the PMIs suggest.”
458;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-12-16T14:31:44Z;France holds back eurozone recovery;;French business activity slumped to a seven-month low in December, exacerbating concerns about the fragility of the eurozone’s second-largest economy.The disappointing French reading hampered a stronger improvement in the broader eurozone, which registered its best quarter in two-and-a-half years.France’s “flash” reading of Markit’s Purchasing Managers Composite index for this month fell to 47 from 48 in November, accelerating its decline and producing yet another reading below 50, the level that separates expansion from contraction.“[The readings] paint a worrying picture of the health of the French economy. The return to contraction in November has been followed up with a sharper reduction in December, with falling new business at the heart of this as clients were reportedly reluctant to commit to new contracts,” said Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit.For the eurozone, the composite reading rose to 52.1 from 51.7 in November, reversing two months of slower expansion. Growth in new orders rose the most since June 2011, while the manufacturing PMI rose to 54.8 from 53.1, the highest in nearly three years.The reading was helped by continued expansion in Germany, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months. Its composite PMI reading was 55.2 compared with 55.4.Improvement outside the eurozone’s biggest two economies also helped the rise, Markit said, as output rose for a fifth month and at the fastest pace since April 2011.Markit called the rise a “relief”, but said that the PMI readings point to a weak 0.2 per cent GDP growth for the fourth quarter, suggesting the recovery “remains both weak and fragile”.The region’s growth prospects were, however, boosted by a strong rise in exports.The euro area’s trade surplus soared to €17.2bn in October, up from €10.9bn the previous month, figures published by Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics bureau, on Monday showed.The first estimate from Eurostat revealed seasonally adjusted exports rose by 0.2 per cent, while imports fell by 1.2 per cent.“The improved trade performance in October lifts hopes that net trade can make a much-needed renewed overall positive contribution to eurozone GDP in the fourth quarter and help it pick up from expansion of just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.But a more detailed breakdown of the data for September showed trade in the region was weaker than originally thought. The overall surplus was cut from an preliminary estimate of €13.1bn.November 20: France’s greater debt burden relative to Germany leaves it vulnerable to climbing borrowing costs when the US Fed tapers its bonds purchasesThe latest PMI indicators add to conflicting signals about the state of the French economy.They follow similar Markit indicators for the private sector earlier this month that pointed to a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter. Many big companies are ploughing through large redundancy programmes and investment levels have been low. A recent spate of protests against high taxes have reinforced a sense of pessimism voiced by many businesses about the outlook.But in an interview with the Financial Times last week, Pierre Moscovici, finance minister, insisted that industrial production was recovering and consumption - the engine of growth in France - was holding up. “France has truly emerged from recession,” he said.He pointed to surveys by Insee, the national statistics institute, and the Bank of France which have painted a rosier picture. Insee has forecast 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter, after a 0.1 per cent reverse in the third quarter. The Bank of France this month upped its forecast by a notch to 0.5 per cent, based on improving production.“Weak French PMIs likely reflect ongoing political uncertainty and continued weak demand,” wrote Barclays in a note to clients. “But overall we remain cautious regarding what we believe is an excessively strong pessimistic signal.”It said over the past two years PMIs had repeatedly underestimated activity in France, pointing to sharp quarterly declines, “while hard data came in on average slightly recessionary at worst”. Barclays is forecasting 0.2 per cent growth i the fourth quarter.BNP Paribas made similar comments. It said that while the data are “a sign of weakness for future economic activity”, the PMI indicators are the “least reliable” of all indices and noted the diverging data from France.France’s services activity index dropped to 47.4 from 48, while the manufacturing PMI fell to 47.1 from 48.4.
459;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-12-16T10:34:21Z;China Flash PMI: not always on the money;;"How are China’s manufacturers feeling? Ending the year on a bit of a downer it seems, if HSBC’s Flash PMI is anything to go by.The reading came in at 50.4, just above the 50-mark that separates contraction and expansion, and pointing to a three-month low. Clear evidence of a cooling in the manufacturing sector? Certainly, if the early reading is a reliable gauge. However, the flash reading is proving to be quite a volatile guide to the final PMI figure.The flash PMI takes in responses from 85 to 90 per cent of the final PMI responses – so it should be close. However, in recent months it has been a off by a bit of a margin, both higher and lower than the final figure – and to confuse further it has also been bang on. In September, the flash PMI was a full point higher than the final reading; in October, it was spot on; and in November, it was 0.4 points lower.This chart shows how in recent months, the flash and final PMI figures have moved less and less in step.Despite this, analysts were pretty clear about the message the flash PMI was giving. Capital Economics said it left “little doubt that the manufacturing sector is now
cooling. Tighter access to credit will continue to weigh on growth in 2014.”Hongbin Qu, China chief economist at HSBC was a bit more upbeat:The December HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI reading slowed marginally from November’s final reading. But it still stands above the average reading for 3Q, implying that the recovering trend of the manufacturing sector starting from July still holds up. As a result, we expect China’s GDP growth to stabilise at around 7.8% yoy in 4Q.Looking at the components of the index, Barclays noted:The moderation was led by a slowdown the expansion in output (51.8 in December vs. 52.2 in November) and a faster drop in employment, which was partially offset by faster expansion in both new orders and new export orders. Although the headline slowdown is consistent with our expectation of moderating growth momentum, the strong performance in new orders was against our expectation of some destocking, and is worth monitoring.Here’s the chart. It will be interesting to see what comes in the final PMI, released on January 2.Related reading:

Scotland had the slowest rise, followed by Yorkshire and Humber.The headline index measuring overall business activity across the UK was 60.2, down from 61.8 in October, but still well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.The survey, conducted by the data company Markit, found that the rise in business activity was supported by improving new order volumes and increased job creation.Earlier this year the recovery looked reasonably widely spread across the country, but the southeast and London have recently started to pull ahead again, undermining hopes of a rebalancing the economy away from wealthier regions.The southeast headed the Lloyds index, followed by the East Midlands, London and the southwest. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland grew more slowly than the English average.Tim Hinton, managing director of SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “Private sector companies across England and Wales continued their impressive growth performance in November and although activity growth was marginally down on the previous month, most regions continue to grow year-on-year.”He added: “Firms also reported that new orders were higher than at the start of the year. Companies are now benefiting from stronger domestic spending patterns and increased optimism about the economic outlook.”
461;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-12-04T10:07:53Z;UK services sector growth remains strong;;Britain’s services sector is continuing to grow strongly and cost pressures are starting to build, according to a survey.The Markit purchasing managers’ index survey of services companies – a sector that accounts for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy – fell from 62.5 in October to 60 in November.Any number above 50 indicates an expansion of activity, though economists had expected a slightly better number of 62.James Knightley, an economist at ING, said the survey “continues to signal very strong growth” in the services sector. When set alongside similar surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors, he said the PMIs were consistent with 1 per cent growth in the last quarter of the year, which would be the fastest economic expansion since mid-2007.Input cost inflation in the services sector hit a nine-month high and the prices companies charge their customers rose at the quickest pace since May 2011, the survey said.Companies also said they were tight on capacity and taking on extra staff to cope with rising workloads. The Bank of England is watching such indicators closely, as it will not be able to keep interest rates at record lows after the economy’s “spare capacity” has been eaten up.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: “Although signalling an easing in the rate of growth in November, the PMI survey of the services economy continues to signal an impressively strong pace of expansion and one of the best performances for the sector we’ve seen since data were first collected in 1996.”
462;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-12-04T10:02:40Z;Eurozone services sector growth slows;;"The expansion in activity in the eurozone’s services industry slackened last month, with a poll of the currency bloc’s purchasing managers registering its lowest reading since August, writes Claire Jones in Frankfurt.The eurozone services PMI, compiled by data company Markit, hit 51.2 in November, slightly above an earlier flash estimate of 50.9 but below the 51.6 October figure.The PMI, a gauge of momentum which in the past has tended to track the direction of economic growth, remains above
the crucial 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.The reading for the UK also slipped, to 60 from 62.5 in October, the highest reading since May 1997.Activity was strongest in Germany. Companies in Ireland and Spain also saw activity grow.But in France, the currency bloc’s second-largest economy, activity slumped by more than expected, with the reading at a five-month low of 48."
463;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-12-02T17:22:54Z;Boost for manufacturers as global demand picks up;;Rising global demand sparked a pick-up in manufacturing activity across the world in November, according to polls of purchasing managers.Activity in the US rose at its fastest pace since April 2011, continuing a run of strong Institute for Supply Management data, at the start of a crucial week of data ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on December 18.The US manufacturing ISM rose to 57.3, from an already strong 56.4 in October, and important components did even better with the forward-looking new orders index up from 60.6 to 63.6. A reading of 50 divides expansion from contraction.The figures point to a strengthening of the global economy after weakness earlier this year. They will raise hopes for strong growth in 2014 and may increase the odds that the Fed soon chooses to “taper” its asset purchases from $85bn-a-month.However, the ISM has run ahead of other data on the US economy, and the single most important release will be Friday’s number on November jobs, with the consensus forecast running at 188,000 new posts.Activity in the eurozone’s factories increased by a little more than expected, propelled by better conditions in Germany, Italy and Greece. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for the single-currency area, compiled by data firm Markit, rose to 51.6 – up from an initial flash estimate of 51.5 and the highest level since June 2012. It is the fifth successive month that the reading has been above 50.“Today’s data are in line with our scenario of a modest and gradual recovery in the manufacturing sector,” said Apolline Menut, economist at Barclays.Manufacturers in the currency bloc and beyond benefited from a rise in export orders. In the eurozone, the sub-reading for orders from abroad rose to its highest level since May 2011. In Japan, the overall index climbed to its highest level in more than four years, rising to 55.1 from 54.2 in October, on the back of strong export growth.China’s official PMI remained at 51.4, unchanged from October. Markit’s reading for the world’s second-largest economy was down slightly, to 50.8 from 50.9 the previous month, with growth driven largely by stronger domestic demand.In the UK, the index hit 58.4, the highest level since February 2011, with reports of improved inflows of work from Asia, the US, Middle East and eurozone.Across the eurozone, the readings for several economies hit multiyear highs.In Italy, the manufacturing PMI rose to its highest level in two-and-a-half years, climbing to 51.4, up from 50.7 in October. It is the sixth month in a row that factory activity in the eurozone’s third-largest economy has expanded.Italian businesses also benefited from a rise in new business orders, in particular from abroad, with new export orders rising at their fastest pace since March 2011.Germany’s manufacturers saw activity rise at its fastest pace for more than two years, while factories in the Netherlands and Austria also witnessed the sharpest increase in activity since the middle of 2011.While manufacturing activity continued to contract in Greece, the PMI reading was the highest in more than four years. On the downside, manufacturers in France and Spain both witnessed the sharpest fall in activity since the first half of the year, although exporters in Spain, the region’s fourth-largest economy, fared well.“Importantly, improving export performances in a range of countries such as Italy, Spain and Ireland are offsetting domestic weakness, underscoring how producers in these countries are becoming more competitive and suggesting the long-term outlook is brightening,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “The big concern is France, which was the only country except Greece to see exports fall.”Despite the pick-up in export business, eurozone manufacturers continued to shed jobs. The sub-index for employment registered 48.8 – unchanged from October. Unemployment in the bloc remains close to record highs, although it fell back slightly in October to 12.1 per cent.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.However, the HSBC/Markit survey showed that factories cut back on staff last month, while inventories also declined.“The renewed contraction of employment and the slower pace of restocking activities call for a continuation of accommodative policy.

Year-on-year, Australia’s November CPI rose 2.4 per cent, an acceleration of the 2.1 per cent recorded in October.Thailand: The country saw consumer price inflation gathering pace in November, rising to a higher-than-expected annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Analysts had expected a rate of 1.82 per cent in November, up from 1.46 per cent in October.Indonesia: Consumer price inflation for November was less than the market had expected at 8.37 per cent, year-on-year, lower than forecasts of 8.48 per cent growth.The increase was up on the 8.32 per cent seen in October.Meanwhile, the country’s trade balance moved into surplus in October from a deficit the previous month, according to statistics bureau data released on Monday. The trade surplus was $50m in October, compared with an expected deficit of $650m.AfricaSouth Africa: The Kagiso Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 52.4 in November from 50.7 in October. Improvements were seen in supplier performance, business activity and new sales. Employment rose to 50.8, the highest figure since November 2012. “Given that there has been no major labour strife in the manufacturing sector so far in Q4, production should rebound during the final quarter of the year,” Kagiso said.New vehicle sales dropped at a faster rate of 4.6 per cent year on year in November, after a fall of 2.9 per cent in October.EuropeEurozone: The manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index reached its highest level since June 2011 – shifting up to 51.6 in November from 51.5 in October.Germany: The manufacturing PMI lifted to 52.7 in November from 51.7. As new business increased at the fastest pace for almost 2.5 years, Markit economists said there were signs that solid growth momentum should be sustained over the next few months.“Backlogs of work were accumulated across the German economy to the greatest degree since mid-2011, providing encouragement that improvements in investment spending and job creation will follow in the wake of the upturn in business conditions,” it said.France: The rate of contraction in the manufacturing sector increased in November; the PMI fell to 48.4 from 49.1 in October. This is the sharpest fall in five months and reflects drops in output, new orders and staffing levels.UK: Manufacturing growth hit its highest point in almost three years, helped by a high pace of job growth. The PMI jumped to 58.4 in November from 56 in October.Italy: The manufacturing sector expanded, pushing the PMI up to 51.4 in November from 50.8 in October.Czech Republic:The budget deficit widened to Kc79.4bn in November from Kc47.7bn in October. While revenues rose by Kc4.14bn year on year, expenditure rose Kc5.63bn over the same period.The manufacturing PMI climbed up to 55.4 in November, the fastest rate of expansion since May 2011. It was helped by the fastest rise in new orders in over 2.5 years, an increase in backlogs of work and improvements in unemployment.Switzerland: The manufacturing PMI accelerated to 56.5 in November, against expectations of a slight decline.Hungary: After slowing to 51.1 in October, Hungary’s manufacturing PMI rose to 52.6 in November. This index has been volatile in recent years and Markit economists pointed out that “the underlying trend is far from robust, with the headline fluctuating around [the] 50 mark amid overall weak activity, apart from transport”.Turkey: The manufacturing PMI hit a 32-month high of 55 in November, up from 53.3 in October. New orders rose to a 2.5-year high, aided by the lira depreciation pushing up new export orders.Sweden: After an improvement in manufacturing confidence, the manufacturing PMI rose to 56 in November from 52 in October.Poland: The manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 in November from 53.4 in October.Russia: After expanding in October, the manufacturing sector contracted slightly in November, pulling the PMI down to 49.4 from 51.8. Markit economists said this was due to weak external demand and inflationary pressure on input prices.Norway: Growth in general public gross domestic debt slipped to 6.2 per cent year on year in October from 6.3 in September as non-financial corporations’ debt fell 3.9 per cent year on year. Household lending was stable at 7.2 per cent, while municipal government debt rose to 8.6 per cent from 8.5.Greece: The manufacturing PMI rose from 47.3 in October to 49.2 in November – the highest level in 51 months – but remained in contraction below 50.AmericasUS: There is further evidence that the US economy is ending the year with more momentum than thought likely even a month ago.US manufacturing expansion quickened in November and beat a forecast from Wall Street economists. The index from the Institute for Supply Management climbed to 57.3 from 56.4 in October.The manufacturing sector, which accounts for just over 10 per cent of the US economy, surprised investors last month by shaking off the government shutdown.After reaching a low for the year in May, the ISM index has accelerated for the past six months.This week will be an important one in shaping investors’ expectations about when the Federal Reserve will taper its bond-buying programme.On Wednesday, the ISM will publish its survey of the services sector for November and on Friday the Bureau of Labor releases its employment report for the same month.Mexico: Remittances into the country rose 4.6 per cent in October, aided by a 9.8 per cent rise in the number being sent.Business conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at the fastest pace in eight months; the PMI rose to 51.9 in November from 50.2 in October.Canada: The manufacturing PMI showed a rise in new orders, while growth in employment slowed to a four-month low. The PMI slipped slightly from October’s 55.6 reading, but remained in the expansionary zone at 55.3.Brazil: A deterioration in the manufacturing sector pulled the PMI down to 49.7 in November from 50.2 the month before.“The only good news was that the measures of inflation included in the PMI report also lost momentum: companies saw input prices rising at the slowest pace since June and output prices climbing at the weakest rate since May,” said Andre Loes, chief economist at HSBC.Additional reporting by FastFT"
465;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Banks ban traders from group chat rooms;;"Several banks including Barclays, Citigroup and Royal Bank of Scotland have banned the use of most group chat rooms as global probes into alleged benchmark manipulations drive a radical reform of trading floors.The scandal over manipulation of the Libor interbank lending rate prompted RBS last year to ban unmonitored chat rooms where traders discussed market topics with rivals, two people familiar with those measures said.“The bank clamped down on this big time. I think we were even going slightly overboard on this,” one senior banker said.Citi two months ago banned chat rooms with multiple banks, restricting instant messages to conversations with traders from one institution at a time. Barclays, which like the other two banks declined to comment, imposed similar bans late last year.Executives at JPMorgan are also examining whether conversations currently carried out on so-called “multi-dealer” chat rooms should be done bilaterally over the phone, it emerged two weeks ago.Banks are re-evaluating their messaging systems as they grapple with the fallout from the Libor scandal and a global probe into alleged manipulation of the $5.3tn-a-day foreign exchange market, the latest in a series of benchmark-related rate-rigging investigations.At least eight regulators in the UK, US, Switzerland and Hong Kong are involved in investigations of more than 15 banks. So far at least a dozen traders have been suspended amid suspicions that chat rooms were used to share sensitive client information.RBS was looking into allegations that some of its traders had been talking to counterparts at other banks in chat rooms designated for “client communication”, one person familiar with the internal probe said.The Libor scandal, which has led to $3.7bn in fines, has raised banks’ awareness of the problems associated with chat rooms as investigators have seized on trails of incriminating messages. These have subsequently proved a public-relations nightmare for several banks. “We wish we had never allowed chat rooms,” one top executive at a large European bank said.But many of the most-used systems still operate outside the bank’s monitoring capabilities.In recent months eight of the world’s largest investment banks have agreed to use a service operated by Markit, the UK data provider, that will connect market participants without taking them outside their own secure internal system.“Customers say we need to look very closely at the rooms we have, and shut down the ones that are not business critical; stop rooms where people have chats on the sly, and we need to have a system where we can identify the individual with his company,” said David Craig, president of Financial and Risk at Thomson Reuters, which runs a popular instant messaging service for financial markets.Senior traders said it had long been a headache to stop junior members of the trading floor from talking too freely with each other in chat rooms. “As soon as you get them to stop, they just start up again. They say all sorts of stupid things,” one said.Additional reporting by Delphine Strauss in London"

But France’s central bank is much more optimistic, forecasting this month that the economy is set to gain momentum towards the end of this year and grow by 0.4 per cent in the final quarter.Markit’s composite purchasing managers' index flash reading for France fell to 48.5, a five-month low, from 50.5 in both September and October. In Germany, the corresponding figure jumped to 54.3 from 53.2, while for the 17-nation single-currency bloc it dropped to 51.5 from 51.9. A reading below 50 signifies contraction.Jack Kennedy, Markit senior economist, said the French survey highlighted “a disappointing slide in activity following two months of marginal growth”.“Renewed weakness was evident across both services and manufacturing, and the poor set of figures underline the fragility of the economy in the face of a persistently anaemic demand environment. Although remaining above the levels seen in the first half of the year, PMI data highlight the risk of a return to recession for France.”The French flash services activity index shrank to 48.8 from 50.9, a four-month low and the flash manufacturing PMI fell to 47.8 from 49.1 in October.Expectations regarding future activity dipped to a six-month low, with survey respondents commenting on “a tough business climate and weak demand”, Markit said.France dragged down the employment figure for the eurozone, where private sector joblessness increased for the twenty-third consecutive month, according to the survey.Tim Moore, author of Markit’s Flash Germany PMI survey, said the figures suggest that “the German economy has built up a head of steam through the final quarter of 2013 and is well on track to achieve growth of close to 0.5 per cent for the calendar year”.“There are also signs that solid growth momentum should be sustained over the months ahead, as new business received by private sector companies increased at the steepest pace for almost two-and-a-half years,” he added.The flash services activity index for Germany was 54.5, a nine-month high, and the flash manufacturing PMI was 52.5, a 29-month high. For the eurozone the figures were 50.9 – down from 51.6, and 51.5, up from 51.3 respectively.Marie Diron, of EY Eurozone Forecast, described the eurozone data as “slightly disappointing”.“Another month of eurozone PMIs at similar levels would force us to revise our already cautious forecast for growth at the end of 2013 and possibly early 2014,” she said. “So far we are forecasting GDP to increase by 0.9% in 2014. This should be enough to stabilise unemployment but will not be sufficient to lead to significant job creation.“If growth continues to disappoint, the risk of deflation in the eurozone will heighten. We expect that, in this scenario, the European Central Bank will relax monetary policy further. Bold actions will be needed to keep the eurozone safely out of deflation.”Separately, Greece’s government forecast on Thursday that the country would emerge from its six-year recession next year. Christos Staikouras said after the budget was submitted to parliament that it forecast growth of 0.6 per cent; the estimate for this year is a contraction of 4 per cent. These mirror figures published by the European Commission earlier this month.Markit on Thursday also published, in conjunction with HSBC, its flash manufacturing PMI for China, which came in at 50.4, down from 50.9 in October and a two-month low. This survey is less well established than the European counterparts and Beijing produces its own version, which is more closely watched."
467;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-17T15:09:35Z;Telecoms dividends set for further fall;;European telecoms dividend payouts will fall by a sixth this year, excluding the resumption of payments from Telefónica, as the sector continues to struggle with sluggish demand and fierce competition.Dividends in the telecoms sector plunged 44 per cent last year from a peak of more than €22bn paid for 2011, according to Markit, the financial information services group, as companies slashed payouts to conserve cash on overstretched balance sheets.The telecoms sector has traditionally attracted more defensive investors given its long-term record of shareholder returns given income from mobile and fixed-line services.The dividend yield on the sector has been among the highest with an average forward looking yield of 5.1 per cent even after the cuts.Competition in the sector combined with the economic downturn and the effects of regulation has dragged down revenues in the past few years, which hit the cash position of group’s guilty of over expansion into new markets over the past decade.Even so, companies in the sector only began to take remedial action to bolster balance sheets through dividend cuts last year.According to Markit, 12 of the 19 major companies in the sector have reduced or suspended payments either this year or last.Tom Matheson, analyst at Markit, said: “Band wave auctions, LTE network rollout, regulations and changing customer behaviour all add up to a squeezed free cash flow. BT’s audacious £1bn assault on premium content for interactive services is just the latest example of how hot competition is getting.”These risks, he added, combined with sluggish growth and the need for restorative M&A, have led the market to attach a high risk premium on any dividends paid.Markit said dividends will be 16 per cent lower this year again overall, although the group stripped out the effects of the resumption of Telefonica’s dividend after a one-year hiatus.Including the payment by the Spanish group, aggregate dividends across the sector are forecast to grow 12% year-on-year.Last year, the Spanish group axed its shareholder payments in order to reduce its net debt to earnings ratio. Telefónica will resume its dividend policy with payment worth about €3.4bn, according to Markit.Markit predicted that the “worst might be over” in spite of the forecast of further cuts to come this year, most notably by Telecom Italia.There was an “improving picture by 2014”, by which time all companies that it tracks are forecast to resume dividends. Next year, Markit expects that five groups will even increase dividends again.Before then, Markit forecasts seven companies to cut dividends again this year, including KPN and Deutsche Telekom.Of companies where management has yet to make intentions clear, Markit said its primary concerns were Telecom Italia and Belgacom. Telecom Italia has a huge debt that needs to be reduced, he said, while Belgacom has low free cash flow.“We’re forecasting Telecom Italia to scrap its payment entirely and we’re forecasting Belgacom to reduce its annual payment by over 30 per cent,” according to Mr Matheson. “Both these companies have high short interest.”Belgacom fired Didier Bellens last week after the chief executive remarked that the government was only interested in the company’s dividends.Markit predicted last week that Mr Bellens might be ousted over the comments, which it said could mean “twists to come” for the majority stated-owned group.Meanwhile, the outperformer in the industry has been Telenor, the Norwegian operator, according to Markit.“Exceptionally, it has increased its dividend every year since 2010 and shows no signs of bucking this trend,” it said.
468;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Housebuilders to more than double dividend payouts;;The UK’s biggest listed housebuilders are set to more than double payouts to shareholders as government-backed incentive schemes boost cash generation in a sector rapidly returning to health.Dividend payments at the nine FTSE All-Share homebuilders are expected to soar 107 per cent in the current financial year to £405m, according to data compiled for the Financial Times by Markit, the research group.The news comes after two of the groups, Persimmon and Bovis Homes, last week reported big rises in the number of buyers putting down deposits on new-build properties.Having suffered badly during the downturn, housebuilders are rebounding as state-backed schemes such as Help to Buy and Funding for Lending boost mortgage approvals and bolster confidence in the housing market.But economists have warned of a potential housing bubble. Halifax last week said UK house prices had gone up 6.9 per cent year on year in October, the fastest growth rate for three years.“Since the beginning of the year, the outlook has rapidly changed,” says Kevin Soyer, an analyst at Markit.But he added: “[Housebuilders] were strongly impacted during the crisis and they cut their dividends, so this is coming from a very, very low base.” Markit forecasts that only Berkeley and Taylor Wimpey will exceed the 3.3 per cent average FTSE 350 dividend yield.In September, Barratt Developments and Redrow resumed dividend payments as they reported strong rises in annual profits. Markit expects dividends for these two groups to increase 140 per cent and 200 per cent respectively for the full-year 2014.Gleeson, the small-cap housebuilder that focuses on cheap homes in the north of England, in September paid its first full-year dividend for five years and is expected to boost its payout 32 per cent next year.Demand for housing is growing and there are fears that volumes are not keeping up. Total new home registrations – houses built but not yet sold – in the third quarter was about 34,000In the boom years leading up to the financial crisis, debate raged between housebuilders and investors, who felt the companies were prioritising their land banks over shareholders. When the market collapsed, much of the land acquired had to be written down or built on at zero margin. “A third of all that lovely cash that was generated was set fire to,” said Charlie Campbell, an analyst at Liberum Capital.Now the housebuilders are rebounding again, he said the feeling among shareholders was, “we’d prefer you grew more slowly, and in growing more slowly you can actually share some of the returns with us”.At the same time, demand for housing is growing and there are fears that volumes are not keeping up. Total new home registrations – houses built but not yet sold – in the third quarter was about 34,000, according to the NHBC industry body. That is set against an average 240,000 homes required annually in England, according to the Town and Country Planning Association.Mr Soyer said: “The companies say they want to pay shareholders but they also need to develop the pipeline. There is strong demand so we need a strong supply.”The data from Markit upgrades a forecast made in September for a 90 per cent rise in dividends at seven FTSE 350 housebuilders, excluding Gleeson and Crest Nicholson.
469;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-05T12:56:42Z;China’s PMI puzzle, UK and Brazil rebound;;The UK’s Purchasing Managers Index started the fourth quarter on a 16-year high, with service sector activity growing at its fastest rate since May 1997, while a private survey on Chinese PMI appeared to contradict the government-issued report that was released on Monday.AmericasChile: The IMACEC measure of economic activity, a GDP proxy, rose 0.8 per cent month-on-month – less than expected. Year-on-year activity rose 4 per cent.AsiaChina: Data on the service sector appears to be a Chinese puzzle, with a private survey contradicting Monday’s government-produced report.The Chinese service sector strengthened in October to its fastest pace of growth since April, led by a surge in new orders, according to the Markit/HSBC services PMI.The index rose from September’s 52.4 to 52.6 in October, above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.The survey attributed the increase to growth in payrolls and optimism within the country’s service sector, but contradicts the government report that showed slowing growth in new orders.“Service sectors saw modest but broad-based improvement into 4Q,” said Qu Hongbin, HSBC economist. “This should help cement China’s growth momentum in the coming months.”Philippines: The October Consumer Price Index year-on-year increase of 2.9 per cent undershot analysts’ consensus forecasts of 3.2 per cent, as lower housing and utility costs had a tempering effect.Much of the increase was attributed to higher food prices, which have risen due to weather-related supply disruption.Australia: Data measuring the performance of the services industry edged up from September to October, yet still languished in level indicating a contraction.The Australian Industry Group survey showed a rating of 47.9 in October – representing a seven-month high – up from 47.1 in September.Taiwan: Official data from National Statistics Taiwan showed an unexpected contraction in consumer price inflation in the most recent quarter.Taiwanese CPI declined from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.83 per cent in the preceding quarter to 0.64 per cent in the quarter to the end of October. The market had tipped a 1.1 per cent increase for the quarter.EuropeUK: The PMI started the fourth quarter on a 16-year high, with service sector activity growing at its fastest rate since May 1997.Data from Markit, the market researcher, showed the PMI rose from 60.3 in September to 62.5 in October, beating expectations for a small month-on-month decline.“Historical comparisons of the PMI against gross domestic product suggest the latest survey data are consistent with a 1.3 per cent quarterly rate of GDP growth, up sharply from previous quarters,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium’s Retail Sales Monitor recorded a 0.8 per cent increase in like-for-like sales on the year in October, up from the 0.7 per cent reported in September.However, the figure missed market expectations of 1 per cent growth, as mild weather limited clothing sales.The BRC attributed the increase to an “encouraging pre-Christmas sales pick-up”, but added that “customers are managing their budgets well while allowing some leeway for occasional treats”.Total retail sales grew 2.6 per cent year-on-year in October, up from September’s 2.4 per cent.Eurozone: Producer price inflation rose 0.1 per cent month-on-month in September, but was 0.9 per cent lower than the year before. While prices in Estonia rose 10.8 per cent year on year and Denmark’s PPI rose 2.5 per cent, Cyrprus showed the biggest drop of 3.6 per cent. The energy sector saw prices rise 2.7 per cent.
470;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Business spending drives services activity to 16-year high;;Britain’s services-led boom could owe more to business spending than thought, according to an influential poll that may alleviate concerns that the economic recovery is being fuelled by debt-laden households.The latest purchasing managers’ index, published on Tuesday, showed activity in the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of the economy and has driven the recent pick-up in growth, rose at its fastest pace since May 1997 in October.The PMI for services, produced by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing & Supply, hit 62.5 in October, up from 60.3 in September. The index has been above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity since the beginning of 2013. The survey showed new orders at their highest level since the series began in July 1996, suggesting activity will stay strong in the months ahead.The sector’s stellar performance has raised concerns that Britain remains over-reliant on consumer spending, which has risen for the past seven quarters, while business investment continues to provide too little support. But a breakdown of the latest PMI suggests companies’ contribution is greater than thought.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The weak spots [in the October services PMI] were hotels, restaurants and catering, and other areas that are reliant on consumer spending.” Of the 600 or so companies who took part in the October poll, many of the best performing were in areas such as computing and IT, and the business-to-business sector.Mr Williamson said: “[Businesses] are starting to make the big decisions on spending that we’ve been hoping to see for the past five years. They’re investing in new offices, they’re investing in more advertising campaigns and they’re taking on more staff.” The PMI’s sub index for employment showed the sector added jobs at the fastest pace in 16 years.The evidence offered by the latest services PMI is supported by the most recent report of the Bank of England’s regional agents. The latest summary, published towards the end of October, said companies’ investment intentions were modestly positive and showed signs of improvement.The report said: “Looking forward, there were indications that plans for additional capacity and product development – in some cases put on hold since the crisis started – were being reconsidered due to growing demand and confidence.”A chart from the Bank’s most recent inflation report, published in August, based on a range of surveys on business’ investment intentions, showed a small rise in sentiment.Consumer spending has fed the recent recovery and is expected to make a strong contribution to growth over the coming 12 months. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said on Monday that more household spending, supported by rising house prices, was likely to drive the recovery in 2014.Official data offer little evidence of a recovery in business investment, which fell in the second quarter according to Office for National Statistics data. However, the ONS data does not include spending in areas such as advertising and marketing, which count as intermediate consumption.In recent months, survey data have also pointed to a pick-up in activity in the more troubled construction and manufacturing sectors, although the strong poll results have not always been matched by official figures. The PMI for construction hit its highest level in just over six years in October. The reading for manufacturing was down slightly from September, but still well above 50.Mr Williamson said: “Manufacturing, services and construction all continued to see very strong rates of expansion, pointing to an ongoing broad-based upturn. However, it is the services sector which – due to its sheer size – is the major driving force behind economic growth at the moment.”
471;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-04T16:31:15Z;UK construction companies damp down talk of recovery;;British construction companies have called for a “sanity check” over the extent of recovery in the building industry despite enjoying their fastest pick-up in business since before the financial crisis.Although a sharp improvement in housebuilding has driven construction activity to its highest levels since September 2007, according to a closely watched index published on Monday, this comes from a low base after the first quarter showed the lowest level of activity since 2001.The Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI output measure came in at 59.4, up from 58.9 in September and above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the sixth straight month.The index shows the industry has enjoyed a strong pick-up in the six months to September, driven by government schemes to stimulate housebuilding and mortgage credit including Funding for Lending and the first stage of Help to Buy.But experts warned that the wider industry continues to struggle after shrinking in the five years since 2007.Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, said: “After five years of falling output, two quarters of growth is good. But it’s far too early to get excited about a golden age.”He added that with Funding for Lending and Help to Buy expected to end in 2015 – an election year – there were doubts over whether the recovery was sustainable.Construction was one of the hardest-hit sectors of the British economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, as housing market activity slumped and the government and businesses axed building projects to save money.Construction activity was already 8 per cent lower in 2012 than in 2011, despite a raft of initiatives by the coalition to boost infrastructure investment. In 2012 construction was 14 per cent lower than the pre-recession peak and deteriorated even further in the first quarter of this year.Jerry McLaughlin, director of economics and public affairs at the Mineral Products Association, which tracks sales of concrete, asphalt and aggregates, called for a “sanity check” after recent headlines claiming a return to “boom” conditions.“Help to Buy has definitely helped to boost private housing,” he said. “But for construction to have a sustained recovery the 85 per cent of construction which is not private housing also needs to show signs of life.”Although the MPA acknowledged a marked improvement since March, it said sales of asphalt – an indication of road works – are only 3 per cent up in the year to date suggesting road construction and maintenance activity is still at a low level.Similarly, recent improvements in aggregates and concrete markets are only starting to offset the 10 per cent decline in 2012.“We think some caution is still needed,” said Mr McLaughlin. Since the pre-recession peak, construction has lost 419,000 jobs.Stephen Ratcliffe, director of the UK Contractors Group, which represents the UK’s 30 biggest builders, including Balfour Beatty, Carillion, and Costain, said contract awards were still 35 per cent down on a year ago.“The mood music from our companies is that the forward pipeline is looking better than it was a year ago but the situation remains fragile and the further out of London and the southeast you go, the harder it is to see green shoots,” he said.
472;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-04T12:40:33Z;UK construction, Australia retail surge ahead;;UK construction activity picked up speed last month to grow at its fastest pace since September 2007, while Australian retail sales continued to push ahead. Data from China offered mixed messages, with the headline PMI showing the services sector at the highest level of the year, while new order growth slowed.Asia-PacificAccording to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, retail sales rose 0.8 per cent month on month to A$22.1bn in September, double the market consensus estimate of 0.4 per cent.All retail categories except for household goods registered higher sales during the month.Other data to come out of Australia showed that the rebounding mining sector and low interest rates had fuelled the housing market, with prices up 7.6 per cent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.Australian home sales are at a two-year high, and demand for home loans is increasing after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a low of 2.5 per cent.The RBA has also been pouring liquidity into the financial system to boost the economy following a drop in mining investment.New Zealand: Commodity prices edged up for a fourth consecutive month, boosted by a 22-month rally for wool prices.The ANZ Commodity Price Index – which tracks the cost of 17 commodities such as venison, beef, kiwi fruit, aluminium, butter and wood pulp – rose 1.3 per cent in October to 327.6, equating to an annual increase of 23 per cent.The October reading is the highest since the index hit 333.5 in April.China: The Purchasing Managers Index offered mixed messages for October, with the headline figure showing the services sector at the highest level of the year, while new order growth decelerated.China’s service sector grew in October at its fastest pace in 12 months, with the non-manufacturing PMI rising from 55.4 in September to 56.3 in October, according to the official National Bureau of Statistics. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.However, the data also showed that new order growth slowed from 53.4 to 51.6 month on month.Eurozone: The bloc reported final manufacturing PMI of 51.3 in October, slightly increasing from 51.1 in September. The figure was a significant increase on the low of 46.7 reported six months ago.The Sentix economic sentiment index rose by 3.2 points to 9.3 – the highest value since May 2011.UK: The UK’s construction activity picked up speed last month to grow at its fastest pace since September 2007, according to data from Markit.The construction purchasing managers' index rose from 58.9 in September to 59.4 in October, beating analysts’ expectations of a flat month-on-month reading.“UK construction output continues to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, with housing, commercial and civil engineering activity all seeing strong rates of expansion at the start of the fourth quarter,” said Markit economist Tim Moore.However, the UK’s construction PMI fell back from 56.3 to 56 from September to October, roughly in line with market expectations of a fall to 56.1.France: Manufacturing PMI fell further below the 50-mark, edging down from 49.8 in September to 49.1 in October.The lower figure mainly reflects a lower pace of increase in overall new orders in spite of higher export orders.Italy: October manufacturing PMI moved in a similar direction in Italy, although still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Data showed that the index slowed from 50.8 in September to 50.7 last month.Turkey: Higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages have contributed to a 1.8 per cent increase in the consumer price index from September to October.On a year on year basis, Turkey’s CPI edged down from 7.88 per cent in September to 7.71 per cent in October, but was still above analysts’ consensus forecasts of 7.2 per cent.Hungary: The Purchasing Managers Index stayed in positive territory at 51 for October, a marked reduction from September’s surprisingly strong figure of 54.4.Poland: The PMI story was stronger in Poland, where the October number rose to 53.4, above 53.1 in September and above market expectations for 52.8. The figure was the sixth consecutive monthly rise in the index.
473;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK construction activity shows strong rise;;Activity in the UK’s construction industry grew last month at its fastest pace for just over six years, offering more evidence of a recovery in the housing market.The construction purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, registered 59.4, against expectations it would remain at September’s level of 58.9.The result is the highest since September 2007 and well above the 50 figure that separates expansion from contraction. It is the sixth consecutive month that activity has grown.Respondents said better housing market conditions were a significant factor. Though the underlying result for housing construction was lower than in September, it was still above the levels for commercial construction activity and civil engineering.However, the growth did look more balanced, with stronger readings for both commercial construction and civil engineering.A big rise in new orders led to companies hiring more workers. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: “The latest survey signals that job hiring and input buying are now rising in tandem with greater new business inflows.”The sector was the hardest hit by the economic crisis, with output dropping more than 16 per cent from peak to trough.
474;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-01T15:26:17Z;Markit calls time on trade reporting service;;Markit is to close down its European trade reporting service as it lacked long-term commercial viability, the UK financial information processor said on Friday.The group confirmed it would close down the operation, formerly known as Markit BOAT, at the end of September next year. London-based Markit has had doubts over the subsidiary’s future for several years and its announcement comes only weeks after Bats Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading exchange, announced its own rival enhanced trade reporting service.Five banks – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS – are already switching to the Bats operation, which will incorporate over-the-counter data as well as listed trades.Markit said “the value of off-exchange European equities data was inherently challenged” due to varying standards in the data used for reporting trades. “There is therefore less demand for off-exchange data than we had originally anticipated.”The service was set up so banks could comply with new incoming European rules around trade reporting as laid down in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Markit bought the business from a consortium of nine banks in 2008 and operated it as a standalone business. Despite processing 87m trades in the first half of the year, it made only a small profit. The impact of the closure would not have a material impact on its earnings, Markit added.“We are in the process of notifying customers to allow them time to transition to an alternative trade data monitor that meets their regulatory reporting obligations,” Markit added.Bats Chi-X Europe is looking to take on the region’s incumbent exchanges in data provision, a lucrative sideline for exchanges. Its new service, launched two weeks ago, collates trades conducted both on exchange and off-exchange offer trade monitoring. It is also intended to bring privately negotiated deals on to the exchange.European regulators are currently working on an update to Mifid and wants the industry to create a consolidated tape, or log of the best bid, offer and execution prices from a host of exchanges and trading venues.Take-up of various industry initiatives has been weak, with users complaining that the quality of information is poor and too expensive. However, industry efforts to create one have regularly foundered over clashing commercial interests of banks, exchanges and data providers.Brussels has been concerned enough by the industry stand-off to threaten mandating financial markets – at its own cost – to provide a single public utility.

It’s a big improvement on just two months ago when only China was showing any postive signs.Of the PMI surveys, Taiwan stood out as most improved, going from 52.0 to 53.0. After the poor GDP data out on Thursday, the strong PMI is further evidence of a stronger end to the year, as analysts suggested.HSBC’s Ronald Man said in the PMI note:Taiwan is entering the final quarter of the year on a strong note. Improvements in output and new orders suggest that sequential growth will pick up. But without a meaningful increase in demand from China, the export-led recovery in Taiwan will unlikely be sustained.China confirmed its recent economic momentum, with the highest PMI reading for seven months, and buoyed by the first expansion in the employment subindex since March.Hongbin Qu, HSBC’s chief China economist noted that “This should support private consumption growth in the coming months. China is on track for a gradual growth recovery.”South Korea edged into positive territory for the first time since May, registering a 50.2 reading.The only laggard of the Asian PMIs reported on Friday was India, which came in at 49.6, still below the 50 mark and the same as September’s reading.Leif Eskesen, HSBC’s chief economist for India said:Manufacturing activity contracted for the third consecutive month in October. Order flows remain weak, despite a bounce-back in export orders after two months of decline. Moreover, businesses continue to cut back purchases and a rise in inventories suggest that output will remain subdued. Input price inflation accelerated further despite the weak growth backdrop, as the effects of the depreciated exchange rate continue to pass through. Saddled with additional costs, firms decided to lift output prices to protect margins. This suggests that the RBI has to continue its staring contest with inflation.You can view the Markit / HSBC reports on Indonesia and Vietnam and South Korea.Related reading:

476;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-11-01T10:03:21Z;Manufacturing activity in UK expands for seventh month;;Manufacturing activity in the UK grew for the seventh month in a row in October, though at a slightly slower pace than in recent months.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, compiled by Markit, the data company, and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing & Supply, hit 56 – down from a revised figure of 56.3 for September but still significantly above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in factory output.The data signalled activity was likely to remain strong in the months ahead, with the sub index for new orders rising at a rate close to the 19-year peak witnessed in August. Companies also reported a strong pick-up in export orders from mainland Europe, Asia, the US, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.Factories added jobs for the sixth month in a row, though at a slower pace than in September.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, a trade body for manufacturers, said: “While the headline index has dipped a little, it still points to a solid expansion in activity across the sector. Particularly encouraging is the strong showing in export demand.”However, the PMIs could be overstating the contribution to growth made by the UK’s factories. Though the survey data on the sector has been encouraging, official figures from the Office for National Statistics have suggested that industry has yet to make a strong recovery following the crisis.The most official recent figures – for August – showed manufacturers’ output declined in the month by 1.2 per cent, against forecasts of a 0.4 per cent rise. The decline was the sharpest since the turn of the year. For the same month, the PMI was at its highest level in two-and-a-half years.
477;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-24T18:00:09Z;UK business confidence rises;;"Thursday is “flash” PMI day and while the pace of expansion slowed in the US and the eurozone, more cheer was to be had in China, where manufacturing growth accelerated. And while business confidence among UK is growing, warning signs about external demand remain.EuropeChris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The dip in the PMI in October is clearly disappointing, but it would be unwise to read too much into one month’s data. It’s too early to say that the recovery is losing momentum. More important is that the survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery.“Spain: The third-quarter unemployment rate dropped to 26 per cent from the second quarter figure of 26.3 per cent thanks to a successful summer tourist season that helped bolster temporary labour. The rate exceeded economists’ expectations of 26.1 per cent. The National Statistics Institute said that employment rose by 39,500 during the period. In the service sector it rose by 123,900, but fell in the agriculture sector by 55,000, by 19,700 in manufacturing sector and 9,700 in the construction sector.Czech Republic: Business confidence rose in October, with the Czech Statistical Office’s composite indicatorrising 1.4 points from September to 88.9, still below the average of 100. Confidence improved among entrepreneurs in industry and some services, but in the area of trade it decreased. Consumer confidence also improved.According to the release: “[The] most important barrier of production still is insufficient demand; it was stated by more than half of respondents. For the next three months, respondents expect an increase in the development of production activity and a slightly increase in the employment. Expectations of general economic situation development for the next three as well as six months are higher than in September.Sweden: Producer prices were 1.1 per cent lower in September, compared with the year-earlier month, according to Sweden’s statistics office. The index was weighed down by export prices. From August, the index rose 0.7 per cent due to higher crude oil, chemicals and machinery costs, vehicle prices in particular providing the impetus.UK: Signs of a recovery in the UK continue to grow, with optimism among manufacturers in the economy rising at the fastest rate since April 2010 in the three months to October, according to the CBI business trends survey.Stephen Gifford, CBI director of economics, said: “The manufacturing sector has increasing confidence in the UK’s recovery. New orders and output are continuing to grow steadily and expectations for the next three months are promising.“But there are only limited signs of rebalancing towards exports or investment, with marginal growth in export orders and firms scaling back plans for capital expenditure on plant and machinery.”AmericasUS: The PMI reading for manufacturing slid to to 51.1 in October from 52.8 in September, the lowest in a year, reflecting only modest growth in the sector that makes up 12 per cent of the economy. Economists had expected little change in the index. Markit, which produces the data, blamed the slowdown in expansion on the US fiscal battle.Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 350,000, according to the Labor Department. This compared with the previous week’s revised figures of 4,000 more claims filed than previously recorded. Data from California was affected by technical problems,Asia Pacific:China: The PMI rose to a seven-month high of 50.9.HSBC, which produces the index jointly with Markit, said that the momentum should continue.Qu Hongbin, HSBC economist for the region, said: “This [reading] implies that China’s growth recovery is becoming consolidated into the fourth quarter following the bottoming out in the third quarter. This momentum is likely to continue in the coming months, creating favourable conditions for speeding up structural reforms.”New Zealand: Stronger dairy exports have helped New Zealand narrow its trade deficit for September. Data from Statistics New Zealand showed the September trade balance NZ$199m in deficit, compared with market expectations for a deficit of NZ$680m.The deficit comprised of NZ$3.83bn of exports and NZ$4.03bn of imports during the month. The country’s overall trade balance for the year to September was a deficit of $1.54bn."
478;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-24T16:27:28Z;Fiscal battle takes toll on US and eurozone business activity;;Growth in the US manufacturing sector slowed this month during the government shutdown, as further evidence emerged on Thursday that the political fight on Capitol Hill was having an impact on the global economy.The Purchasing Managers’ Index reading for manufacturing slid to 51.1 in October from 52.8 in September, the lowest in a year, reflecting only modest growth in the sector that makes up 12 per cent of the economy. Economists had expected little change in the index.Output, a sub-index of the report, declined for the first time in more than four years and new order growth was the weakest in six months.The deadlock over the US government’s finances prompted widespread concern from China to the International Monetary Fund, which warned that failure to raise the debt ceiling would have knock-on effects on the global economy.Economists at S&P have estimated the two-week shutdown shaved at least 0.6 per cent off annualised fourth-quarter growth, or about $24bn out of the economy.Although a fiscal crisis was averted earlier this month, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, blamed the federal government shutdown for the deceleration in growth, saying “the disruptions and uncertainty caused by the crisis hit companies hard”.The effects of the shutdown were also felt in the eurozone where growth in the manufacturing and service sectors fell.The eurozone composite Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index, combining both manufacturing and services sectors, for the eurozone fell to 51.5 in a “flash” reading for October, from the 27-month high in September of 52.2. Any reading above 50 indicates overall growth. The figure was substantially below economists’ estimates for a reading of 52.4.The fiscal battle probably bruised activity in the eurozone as well, said Marie Diron, senior economic adviser to Ernst & Young. She pointed out that some of the data were collected ahead of the recent showdown in the US.“It could be that eurozone companies preferred to wait until they had more visibility about the future of the US economy before placing orders,” she said. Ms Diron added that next year eurozone growth should reach 1 per cent as external demand strengthens, helping stabilise unemployment.Output in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, continued to rise, although at a slower pace than previous months, while the French reading was at a two-month low. But the eurozone as a whole reported “modest growth of activity for the third month”, the first such period of expansion since early 2011.“The dip in the PMI in October is clearly disappointing but it would be unwise to read too much into one month’s data,” Markit’s Mr Williamson said. “[It] will remind policy makers that a sustainable upturn is by no means assured, and adds confirmation to the ECB’s view that the recovery is slow, uneven and fragile.”While a full-on crisis has been averted for now, Congress faces a repeat of the debacle early next year unless a long-term solution is found.The recent political instability has cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will now maintain its stimulus programme at least until the start of next year while it assesses the damage done to growth by the government shutdown. With loose monetary policy keeping the dollar weak, the single currency is trading close to a two-year high. Its resilience is already taking a toll on European exporters and is likely to be unwelcome to policy makers at the European Central Bank, given the eurozone’s already fragile recovery.Meanwhile, a separate preliminary reading showed that Chinese manufacturing activity rose to a seven-month high. The index of private sector manufacturers, created jointly with HSBC, showed that PMI rose to 50.9 from 50.2 in September.While this news will be welcomed by economies that rely heavily on China for exports, focus was on the economy’s money rates, which spiked higher on Thursday after the central bank withdrew cash from the financial system. It raised concerns that there could be a renewed liquidity squeeze similar to earlier this year.Both the US and Chinese PMIs from Markit and HSBC are relatively new and untested. The US manufacturing ISM figure is the most closely watched barometer of manufacturing activity in that economy, while in China, it is the official PMI figure.
479;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-22T16:44:58Z;Default fears hit JC Penney bonds;;Fears of JC Penney defaulting on its debt have escalated after worries over the department store’s future were exacerbated by an analyst’s prediction that its share price would plunge to $1.The premium on JC Penney five-year credit default swaps – a form of insurance that reflects market views of a company’s creditworthiness – on Tuesday jumped to 1,659 basis points, up 185bp from the end of last week, according to Markit data.The unusually sharp rise to such levels implies a chance of default of more than 60 per cent, analysts said.JC Penney bonds have been under pressure since sales began to tumble under former chief executive Ron Johnson.He was replaced by Mike Ullman in April this year, and the new chief has struggled to restore market confidence.A bond sell-off has accelerated in the past two weeks with a growing number of investors betting the company will be forced to restructure some of its debt obligations.Last week, JC Penney was forced to quash rumours that it had hired bankruptcy lawyers, a notion that it described as “unequivocally false”. It blamed unnamed investors who it said were “trying to manipulate the market for their personal gain”.The Texas-based chain’s reputation took another hit on Monday when Mary Ross-Gilbert, analyst at Imperial Capital, lowered her one-year price target for the company’s shares to $1 from $5.JC Penney shares fell 8.3 per cent on Monday but recovered slightly on Tuesday morning, climbing 2.9 per cent to $6.60.Ms Ross-Gilbert said in her report: “While we think [JC Penney] can be turned round, we are becoming increasingly concerned that without a deep-pocketed long-term investor providing financial and ‘halo’ support, the company may strategically file for bankruptcy protection to conserve cash while it continues to execute a turnround.”Mr Ullman is reversing his predecessor’s much-criticised decision to scrap discounting and some clothing brands. But JC Penney has said like-for-like sales continued to fall year on year into September, although less sharply than in previous months.JC Penney repeated its assertion this month that it expected to have more than $2bn of liquidity at the end of its financial year in January.“When combined with the reported improvements in our business trends, the need for ‘financial restructuring’ is purely speculative and not grounded in fact,” it said.Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities, said: “Obviously, it is in everyone’s best interests, at least for retail and long-only fund managers, that the company honours its debt commitments.“But at this stage and with spreads trading at these levels, regular investors have probably already abandoned the trade. This now seems to be a market for distress-debt accounts and hedge funds.”
480;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-20T12:46:01Z;UK technology job creation outpaced other sectors for four years;;"Rates of job creation at UK technology companies have outpaced the private sector as a whole for the past four years, according to the first detailed portrait of employment in the sector.The number of jobs in the sector now exceeds 1m out of a total of 28m employees across all UK sectors, compared with 915,000 out of 27m in 2010, confirming that technology is a significant employer in Britain despite fears that rapid growth was concealing low job numbers.The difference in growth rates was most striking in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when the tech sector saw a shallower downturn and was quicker to recover than the wider economy.The report compiled by data firm Markit for KPMG shows the growth has been sustained since then. Jobs in the tech sector rose 4.3 per cent year on year in the first half of 2013 compared with 0.9 per cent jobs growth for the private sector as a whole.The report, Tech Monitor UK, also features a detailed geographical breakdown of tech sector clusters in the UK.The breakdown by local authority shows that the area with the highest concentration of tech sector jobs is Wokingham in Berkshire, which includes a business park that is home to the UK headquarters of Microsoft and Oracle. The proportion of tech jobs there is five times the national average.The M4 corridor dominates Britain’s tech economy; six of the top 10 local authorities with the highest concentrations of tech jobs are clustered around this motorway.Rushmoor in Surrey is the second-highest ranked local authority. It includes the town of Farnborough, which hosts a number of tech companies at business parks such as the Farnborough Aerospace Centre.Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire and Christchurch in Dorset had the highest proportion of tech workers outside the southeast.In London, 21 out of 33 local authorities had a higher proportion of tech workers than the national average. In the capital, the local authority with the greatest concentration of tech workers is Richmond upon Thames.The Tech City area around Old Street roundabout in London does not feature as a distinct area in the report because it is split between Hackney and Islington.Scotland and Yorkshire had the lowest proportion of tech workers compared with the national average. The study did not cover Northern Ireland.Britain’s homegrown tech sector is still awaiting its first initial public offering. London-based developer King, creators of the game Candy Crush Saga, is reported to have filed confidentially for an IPO in the US.The Tech Monitor UK report, published on Monday, measures job creation according to the purchasing managers’ index data gathered monthly by Markit. The data show that the tech sector had an average PMI reading of 54.4 this year compared with 51.3 for the UK private sector as a whole.Output growth has accelerated sharply following a relatively soft patch at the beginning of 2013, and the upswing in the sector during August was notably faster than seen across the wider global economyThe gap between tech employment and the wider economy was greatest in 2010, when the tech sector reading was 54.1 compared with a UK average of 50.2. Any figure above 50 indicates growth.The PMI data draw on figures from 150 tech companies within Markit’s regular survey panel of more than 1,000. The businesses operate in the IT sector, tech testing, communications or are manufacturers of tech equipment. Markit intends to publish quarterly PMI figures for the tech sector.The report finds that business activity growth at UK tech companies is the fastest since May 2010. It says: “The figures show that UK tech company output rebounded strongly after the global financial crisis . . . and has now expanded throughout much of the past four years.“Most recently, output growth has accelerated sharply following a relatively soft patch at the beginning of 2013, and the upswing in the sector during August was notably faster than seen across the wider global economy.”Tudor Aw, head of technology for KPMG Europe, said the findings confirmed the increasing importance of the sector.Mr Aw said: “Yes it suffered a downturn when we had the financial crisis, but when I talk to colleagues in real estate or retail, it was a bloodbath [whereas] tech has a natural refresh cycle.“You can’t go three to five years without having to refresh your equipment, particularly in a recession, for cost take-out, and to increase productivity. If you want to compete and stay on top, you’re going to invest in technology.”While offshoring of tech jobs has continued, Mr Aw said this freed resources for companies to move up the value chain. “If you can save costs through outsourcing, there are funds for investment in R&D.”…Thames Valley perksOutside Jive Software’s plate-glass windows, cold autumnal rain is sleeting into a pond speckled with lily pads. Inside, a fridge is packed with free beer, on a breakfast bar are bowls of fruit and nuts, and a couple of employees are taking their break by playing football on a game console, writes Jeevan Vasagar.“Nice cake, Debbie,” a worker tells office manager Debbie Howard, wiping away crumbs.The Palo Alto company’s European headquarters, at Thames Valley business park near Reading, may endure British weather but it offers Silicon Valley-style employee perks.An analysis of tech sector employment in Britain, conducted by Markit for KPMG, has revealed that the borough of Wokingham has the highest concentration of tech jobs in the country.Thames Valley park, a 200-acre estate on the east side of Reading, is part of the explanation. It is host to the UK headquarters of Microsoft and Oracle, and many smaller tech businesses.Jive Software, whose flagship product brings social networking techniques to internal corporate communications, was drawn to the location partly by proximity to other businesses. The company moved to the business park in July.Mike O’Farrell, Jive Software’s director of global facilities, said: “We don’t necessarily recruit from other companies, but we’re looking for the same talent.“Often the talent is looking in the same neighbourhood.”We feel very strongly about collaboration. We want people to be sitting on a couch having a conversation over a soda and a snack as much as at a deskGood public transport links were another pull factor; the business park’s managing agents provide a free shuttle bus to Reading town centre, which runs every six minutes at peak times, while London is about 30 miles away on the M4.The decor in Jive Software’s offices is an upbeat mix of stripped wooden floors, white walls and furniture in vibrant pastel shades.Around 50 employees work in a single, open-plan space, with meeting rooms around the sides and a break room – with pool table, TV, and sofas – at the front of the building. The informality is intended to encourage casual networking.Mr O’Farrell said: “We feel very strongly about collaboration. We want people to be sitting on a couch having a conversation over a soda and a snack as much as at a desk.”The company shares the robust growth expectations of the rest of the sector.Markit’s research finds that 83 per cent of tech companies in the UK forecast a growth of business activity over the coming year, compared with just 5 per cent that anticipate a decline.Across all sectors, 60 per cent forecast growth while 9 per cent are pessimistic.Amanda Pires, Jive Software’s chief communications officer, said: “Our growth rate in the second quarter was 30 per cent. We continue to grow, and continue to hire all over the world as our business grows.”"
481;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
482;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;London leads UK-wide growth in business activity;;London achieved the fastest rise in business activity last month but northwest England and the East Midlands were not far behind, a survey of 1,200 employers has found.Growth in Wales reached a four-year high as all 12 UK regions recorded healthy levels of business activity, according to the Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking regional purchasing managers’ index.It found that companies were starting to hire extra staff and increase production capacity to meet growing demand.The survey, conducted by data company Markit, underlines other business polls pointing to accelerating output, though an unexpected drop in factory output last month suggested that recovery may not be smooth.Lloyds’ headline index averaged 60.5 across the UK, slightly down on the previous month’s 60.8 but still indicating significant growth.Although the capital had its nose ahead, growth in other regions was also strong. Even northeast England, which remained the weakest-performing region, has recorded growth for the past five months.Improvements in domestic business and consumer sentiment were cited as driving greater business activity, with increased volumes of new business recorded. London saw improved levels of new work in its service sector.Higher levels of employment were reported by private sector companies, with a number of respondents noting that rising backlogs of work and greater confidence in the economic outlook had encouraged hiring. The West Midlands saw the strongest rise in employment, followed by the northwest.David Oldfield, managing director of SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “These figures are a sign of a real building of momentum that we expect to continue into the final quarter of 2013. Companies . . . have grown in confidence during the summer, and the latest survey shows that this new-found optimism is translating into results.”He added: “Increasing numbers of businesses are now turning their attention towards recruiting additional staff and ramping up production capacity to meet growing output requirements.”In the City, financial services job opportunities increased 8 per cent last month compared with August, said Morgan McKinley, a specialist recruiter. However, the number was still 19 per cent down on a year earlier.The financial services sector is now on a noticeable road to recoveryHakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, said there was a “renewed energy” in London’s financial services sector after a drop in vacancies in July and August.“September 2013 marked five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers which arguably led to the worst global recession in recent times.“The positive news however, is that the financial services sector is now on a noticeable road to recovery,” he said.Economists expect the unemployment rate to remain unchanged in monthly labour market statistics to be published on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll.The unemployment rate has become a crucial economic indicator since the Bank of England said in August it would not raise interest rates until unemployment fell to 7 per cent, which it did not expect to happen until mid-2016.The labour market has behaved oddly in the past couple of years: employment grew rapidly last year when the economy was stagnant but jobs growth has been slow this year despite the accelerating recovery of output.However, productivity, which has been poor since the recession, rose for the first time in two years in the second quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics.
483;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Risk-taker Lance Uggla challenges Bloomberg;;Financial data empires often bear the name of their architect. However, while Markit does not bear the name of its co-founder Lance Uggla, the UK company’s rise over the past decade is closely associated with the enthusiastic 51-year-old Canadian.Mr Uggla was in the spotlight this week as Markit announced plans to take on Bloomberg, the industry incumbent in instant messaging, backed by eight of the world’s largest investment banks. Behind this most modern of communications tools through which traders exchange daily news, gossip and sentiment lies a heated battle with data providers over rising bank technology costs.Breaking that stranglehold will be a challenge for Markit. However Mr Uggla, who cites UK computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee as an inspiration, has already made Markit one of the world’s biggest providers of financial information.His efforts were recognised last year as Ernst & Young’s UK Entrepreneur of the Year. The judges noted Mr Uggla was an “impressive individual who has created a strong culture at his company”.The company emerged in 2001 when Mr Uggla was then global head of credit trading at TD Securities in London. However, he saw it was difficult to find accurate prices for the fast-growing but opaque market for credit default swaps.Mr Uggla recognised other brokers were in the same position. He quit to run an independent company providing that information to the rest of the market. In the early days the company was run from a barn at Mr Uggla’s home in St Albans, a London commuter town known for its Roman ruins.Markit has long since outgrown its beginnings. Its 3,000 employees now oversee pricing and valuation of difficult-to-obtain financial data, and processing and risk management of over-the-counter derivatives.That risk-taking spirit remains with Mr Uggla, who also likes to seek out difficult ski slopes in his native Canada. He wants Markit “to be the best of the largest” financial information companies. Two years ago he tried unsuccessfully to buy LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house, losing out to the London Stock Exchange Group.Plans include taking on anti-money laundering and customer background checks for banks, a necessary but costly part of daily banking operations.His success has prompted frequent speculation that Markit may seek an initial public offering, although he has long said he feels under no pressure to do so and no decision has been made.Nevertheless there has been a rebalancing of shareholders in the past six months. The investment banks that he sold his data to have become shareholders in Markit but some sold down their stake to Temasek, the Singaporean wealth fund. The fund now has a stake of about 10 per cent, and Markit has a valuation of about $5bn.Only in May Mr Uggla sought to play down the IPO talk. “Every year we look carefully at all options available to the company. We regularly consult bankers and other advisers to help us understand our best alternatives and sometimes this can generate rumours or speculation about our future plans.”Should that change, London would probably vie with New York for Markit’s business. A New York listing might suit the company but could provoke mixed feelings for Mr Uggla. His ties to London run deep. The UK capital is not only Markit’s headquarters but his family has long been settled there and Mr Uggla holds an MSc from the London School of Economics. It is also home to his beloved Arsenal football team.

Sellers of the CDS contracts have to compensate buyers of the derivatives when a credit event, such as a sovereign default, occurs.The spike in trading activity is unusual for US sovereign CDS, which is traditionally a very thinly traded market. Traders often say that buying protection on the possibility of the US government restructuring or defaulting on its debt, is akin to buying insurance for the end of the world.“It’s pretty incredible to see this market suddenly going from zero to 100 in just one week,” said one CDS trader.The cost to insure €10m worth of US government bonds over one year using CDS contracts has jumped more than tenfold, from about €6,000 in recent months to €66,000 on Wednesday, according to prices from Markit, the data provider.At the same time the dealer banks who make markets in CDS have sharply increased their activity in contracts on US government bonds, according to Markit.Dealers have started providing price quotes on one-year US CDS for the first time in months and are now making 15 to 20 quotes per day. Price quotes for protecting US bonds over the course of five years, traditionally the more popular contract, have roughly doubled to as many as 50 a day.“It can be an indicator that you’re seeing more interest in the market,” said Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit. “We’ve seen quotes go up quite a bit over the last week.”Market participants are still debating whether a technical default by the US government would actually trigger payouts on US CDS. Even if contracts are not triggered, investors can use the price movement in the CDS to offset, or hedge, the movement in their other assets, such as short-term US Treasuries.On Wednesday, investors continued to sell off Treasury securities that they deem most vulnerable to a missed payment. The yield on the T-bill maturing on October 17 jumped to 48 basis points on Tuesday, up from less than zero in September.
485;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-08T13:21:28Z;Japan current account underwhelms;New Zealand confidence at 14-year high;Japan’s run of uncertain economic data has continued, with its current account surplus undershooting forecasts. The lower figure came in spite of the “Abenomics” economic reform programme denting the value of the yen. Meanwhile in Switzerland, retail sales reversed their contraction from July, driven by non-food sales.AmericasChile: Consumer prices rose 0.5 per cent month on month in September and headline inflation slipped downt to 2 per cent lower year on year. Core inflation stood at 1.4 per cent.Asia PacificJapan: The Japanese current account surplus arrived well below observers’ expectations on Tuesday, falling by nearly two-thirds in August compared with a year ago. Forecasters had assumed that it would grow nearly one-fifth year-on-year.The current account surplus fell 64 per cent in August, compared with forecasts of an 18 per cent gain, while the unadjusted monthly balance was Y161.5bn, against forecasts of Y520bn and down from Y577.3bn in July.A fall in Japan’s current account indicates that the country is receiving less income from overseas investments – a figure that had previously been bolstered by weakness in the yen making overseas earnings appear larger.The Economy Watchers’ diffusion index for current conditions rose to 52.8 in September from 51.2 in August, the first gain in six months. The expectations indicator also picked up, helped by Tokyo winning the competition to host the 2020 summer Olympics.Australia: Australian business confidence jumped to a 3½-year high in September, a sign that the resource-rich economy may be poised for a lasting post-election bounce. The confidence gauge measured by the National Australia Bank business survey, released on Tuesday, rose 12 points last month, to hit its highest level since March 2010.New Zealand: The economic data from Australia’s eastern neighbour were similarly rosy, with third quarter business confidence in New Zealand hitting 38 per cent – the highest level recorded since March 1999.The sentiment index was up from 32 per cent in the previous quarter, and was buoyed by a broad increase in trading activity and the expectation that the central bank would lift interest rates next year.China: China’s service sector is expanding “substantially” below trend, a new survey shows. The Markit/HSBC services PMI came in at 52.4 last month, indicating a deceleration from the 52.8 level in August. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.As with its manufacturing counterpart, the service sector reported higher input costs. But whereas employment had declined for six straight months among manufacturers, the service sector reported a slight increase in staffing levels.Both sectors are passing on higher costs by raising output prices, which could weaken client demand and “dampen future growth prospects,” the survey results say.Qu Hongbin, HSBC’s chief economist for the region, said China’s service sector is rapidly stabilising. He said: “Combined with the gradual improvement of the manufacturing PMI, the Chinese economy is still on the way to a modest recovery. But a more consolidated and sustainable recovery requires structural reforms.”EuropeGermany: Germany’s trade surplus increased more than expected to €15.6bn in August, buoyed by lower imports.The surplus was up from €14.5bn in July and ahead of economist forecasts of €15.1bn. Imports rose 0.4 per cent, compared with 0.5 per cent in the prior month and against expectations of a 0.9 per cent rise.Hungary: Hungary’s industrial output in August rose 0.9 per cent year-on-year, missing market expectations for a 1.5 per cent rise.Weaker numbers in the mining and quarrying sector were a factor behind the contraction, with output falling 7.2 per cent compared with the same month last year, although manufacturing edged up 0.6 per cent on the same basis.Czech Republic: The Czech unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage points during September to 7.6 per cent, in the face of a weak economy and sluggish labour market.
486;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-07T17:11:17Z;Markit sends rivals message of intent;;Less intrusive than a phone call, more personal than an email. For many traders instant messaging has become the main way market participants keep in contact with customers and other traders.However, behind this most modern of communication tools lies an often controversial battle between the world’s largest investment banks and the market’s critical data providers over the cost and influence involved in providing what has become an industry utility.Markit, the UK-based data provider, on Monday opened a new chapter in the fight by creating an open messaging network that will link together many banks’ independent internal, secure and legally compliant networks.In doing so, the company takes on Bloomberg, the financial data and news empire whose own chat function has long dominated traders’ screens. The formal rollout of Markit Collaboration Services comes four months after banks, including Goldman Sachs, complained that Bloomberg reporters had been using its ubiquitous terminals to spy on bankers.For an industry concerned about privacy, Markit’s new offering marks a radical departure from the norm.“To date, communication between market participants has been hampered by the lack of system interoperability,” says Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit. “The new network removes barriers to industry communication by allowing messaging platforms, critical to price discovery and pre- and post-trade operations, to connect to each other.”The UK group has signed up a host of big names for the service, which will act as a centralised vetting directory. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Thomson Reuters have all backed the messaging network.However, alongside that push to make modern markets more efficient is a more competitive attempt by Markit and the banks to cut costs and gain some leverage over sometimes controversial pricing policies imposed by Bloomberg, the US data provider.While traders at rival institutions could not contact each other over their company’s own proprietary network, they have been able to do so via the screens of Bloomberg.It remains the dominant chat tool used by the global financial community in spite of attempts by Thomson Reuters to challenge it.Highly popular among traders long before internet companies developed their own versions, Bloomberg’s 315,000 subscribers exchange 200m messages and have 15m to 20m conversations daily.For some banks Bloomberg instant messaging is one of the main ways of keeping in touch with customers such as pension funds, hedge funds and asset managers. Although they may have little use for the rest of the data, it comes with a $2,000 per month charge for the terminal.“Whilst markets are recovering, we’re seeing them re-emerge in a very different form,” says Steve Grob, group director of strategy at Fidessa, a UK trading technology company. “People are starting to think very hard about the cost implications of running these things.”Banks say that using the Markit chat function would give them access to a broader pool of clients than those who are on Bloomberg.“Chat is a commodity in some ways. It’s not very expensive or difficult to copy the chat function, but the network that exists on Bloomberg is very hard to replicate,” says one executive at a large US investment bank. “Like any business we don’t want to be beholden to one supplier. By and large, people are reasonably happy with Bloomberg but if you’re thinking about it reasonably you don’t want to be beholden to one supplier – it gives them too much market power.”These trends align the banks’ objectives with that of Markit, which is aiming to extend its importance in the provision of financial data, a market which has hitherto been dominated by Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.It was founded more than a decade ago by former TD Securities executives to provide banks with credit derivatives prices. However it has since grown by acquisition to include other complex, uncompetitive, yet vital, market processes such as trade reporting and confirmation for over-the-counter derivatives trades. It is now owned about 50 per cent by various banks.The internal focus, combined with the building of an instant messaging service and a recent push into outsourcing of other banking functions, has led to speculation that the group is preparing for an initial public offering.However, success for both the bank investors and Markit relies on the take-up of the messaging service.“The key challenge facing Markit is to establish its own positive feedback loop, where the value of the service increases as more users become part of the network, says Sassan Danesh, managing partner at Etrading Software, a technology consultancy.“By co-opting the installed base of existing messaging networks, the new service may gain the critical mass it needs,” he said.
487;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-06T23:02:42Z;Eight investment banks embrace Markit viral messaging revolution;;Eight of the world’s largest investment banks will on Monday launch their most ambitious assault on Bloomberg’s grip on daily communications in financial markets with the start of free viral messaging service.Markit, the UK data provider, will operate an industry-wide central directory switchboard to connect the messaging systems of Thomson Reuters, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and interdealer broker GFI Group.Instant messaging on private networks has become one of the principal ways participants in financial markets swap the daily information that drive trading.Trails of incriminating messages played a central role in the cases brought against financial institutions by US and UK authorities for attempted manipulation of Libor, the interest rate benchmark.Yet most systems operate independently. The move to connect up the fragmented market of separate chat messaging systems into a free viral community comes as financial services companies increasingly explore ways to share ever-rising IT costs and compliance requirements.“This is about helping our customers find new counterparties and unearth new business opportunities whilst reducing complexity,” said David Craig, president of Financial and Risk at Thomson Reuters.However, it is also expected to put pressure on Bloomberg, the US financial data provider, whose distinctive, secure but expensive black terminals dominate chat around the world’s financial markets.Embedding it on the Bloomberg terminal has played a key role in the US group’s rise in the last 20 years as it predates many internet-based alternatives.For some banks, the instant messaging and social network is the key reason for the annual $20,000 per terminal, earning it the description of “a very expensive Facebook”.“For some big banks, it’s an incredibly expensive instant messaging device,” said an executive at one market infrastructure company. “They’re saying, ‘we’re spending $120m a year on Bloomberg. That needs to come down’.”The Markit system will act as a central, vetted directory, allowing users to connect in rival banks without leaving their own secure, internal system.The UK group said only the sender and receiver could view messages while message content was never stored.However, observers warn that the biggest obstacle will be creating a “network effect” – by which the value of a service increases as more people use it.“What’s significant is the number of companies that have committed to the platform,” said Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit. “We think it will be transformational.”Mr Uggla said Markit was in talks with other financial institutions about joining and had approached Bloomberg, although no decision had yet been taken.Markit is also trying to entice institutional investors, hedge funds and pension funds to join by offering incentives for early adopters.“We work with dozens of dealers and today we rely on multiple systems to communicate,” said Jim Toffey, head of e-markets at GFI Group. “The ability to use one platform to reach many customers is extremely valuable.”
488;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-04T23:20:03Z;Stocks rebound but US debt worries remain;;Friday 21:10 BST. Global equities and the dollar rebounded at the end of a week dominated by the budget impasse in Washington that forced a partial shutdown of the federal government and raised the spectre of a US debt default.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 US equity index had rallied 0.7 per cent from a near four-week closing low reached on Thursday, and was down just 0.1 per cent over the week. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index edged up 0.1 per cent, trimming its weekly decline to 0.9 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.9 per cent for a hefty five-day drop of 5 per cent – its first weekly decline in a month.The dollar, meanwhile, rebounded 0.4 per cent against a weighted basket of currencies following its drop to an eight-month low on Thursday.The euro was down 0.5 per cent against the dollar, paring its rise over the week to about 0.2 per cent, while the US currency was trading at Y97.34 against the yen – up 0.2 per cent on the day but down nearly a full yen over the five-session period.The dollar’s generally softer tone did little to help gold. The metals’s traditional status as a haven in times of turmoil went unheeded as it tumbled as much as 3 per cent on Tuesday as the shutdown began. Gold was trading late on Friday at $1,308 an ounce – down $8 on the day and $28 on the week.Industrial commodities had a mixed week. Copper rose 1 per cent in London on Friday to $7,260 a tonne, but was down 0.5 per cent on the week. Brent oil settled at $109.46 – up 46 cents on the day and 83 cents on the week.As the US government shutdown entered its fourth day, the initial view within the markets that it would prove to be a shortlived affair was increasingly being reassessed. Indeed, concerns mounted that politicians might not reach agreement on a continuing resolution to fund the government before the Treasury runs out of cash.“Congress appears to be no closer to resolving the now week-old government shutdown,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. “Our best guess is that a comprehensive agreement will be reached sometime close to the October 17 debt ceiling deadline.”Worries about the possibility of a US debt default were reflected by a sharp rise in short-dated T-bill yields and an increase in the cost of insuring Treasuries against such a scenario.But the price action across the broader US government bond market hardly suggested investors were panicking. The 10-year Treasury yield, although up 4 basis points at 2.65 per cent on Friday, was only 2bp higher over the week.Furthermore, yields remained sharply down from the highs reached at the beginning of September – before the Federal Reserve’s decision not to begin scaling down, or “tapering”, its quantitative easing programme.“This is a combination of the risk aversion that is naturally associated with this political uncertainty, but also because the Fed has won round one of the battle of tapering by convincing investors that the economy is not strong enough to end QE just yet,” said Chris Iggo at Axa Investment Managers.The markets were not fully able to gauge the current health of the US economy as last month’s non-farm payrolls report – the most closely watched of all data releases – was not released as scheduled on Friday owing to the shutdown.Private sector surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity showed relatively encouraging levels of expansion last month – although the ADP jobs report was slightly weaker than most had expected.“The incoming data, which now exclude almost all government data releases, suggest that moderate growth continued before the government shutdown,” said Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays.“We estimate that the shutdown will weigh on fourth-quarter real GDP growth by 0.12 percentage points per week, but think that failing to raise the debt ceiling would produce a much larger drag.”Many in the markets argued that the economic uncertainty sparked by the shutdown might prompt the Fed further to delay the start of “tapering”.Relatively positive data out of the eurozone this week were also overshadowed by political events – this time in Italy.Enrico Letta, the country’s prime minister, comfortably survived a confidence vote as political manoeuvring by Silvio Berlusconi backfired spectacularly. Italy’s Senate committee voted on Friday to recommend the expulsion of Mr Berlusconi from the upper house following his conviction for tax fraud.The more stable political outlook sent Italy’s 10-year government bond yield sliding 26bp to 4.41 per cent over the week, while shares in Milan jumped 3.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank sprang few surprises as it left its main interest rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent and said that it was ready to provide cheap loans to banks, through further longer-term refinancing operations, if needed.
489;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-03T09:27:31Z;Services sector has best quarter for 15 years;;Activity in the UK’s dominant services sector surged again in September, according to a poll of purchasing managers, rounding off the best quarterly performance for more than 15 years.September’s purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, was 60.3, slightly lower than August’s seven-year high but well above the 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity.The result means that the sector, which makes up more than three-quarters of the economy, had its strongest three months since the second quarter of 1997.Services companies created jobs at close to their fastest rate in six years, while new business orders continued to grow rapidly. Both factors suggest activity will remain strong in the coming months.Looking further ahead, business expectations climbed to 71.8 – the highest level since February 2011.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “Growth is being led by financial services, linked in part to increased housing market activity, and the business sector. Consumer-facing services continue to struggle, reflecting the ongoing squeeze on incomes.”The services data follow the publication of strong PMI figures for the construction and manufacturing industries this week. The composite PMI was only slightly down on August’s record high, registering 60.4.All three employment indices suggested companies were adding jobs at a fast pace, which, if maintained, could lead unemployment to fall more quickly than the Monetary Policy Committee thinks. Rate-setters have pledged to hold rates at 5 per cent until joblessness falls from 7.7 per cent to below 7 per cent, which it expects to happen around the middle of 2016.David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: “Any sign that better growth is coming disproportionately from employment growth, and hence falling unemployment, will have implication as to when the market anticipates the BoE will take stock of its forward guidance.”
490;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-02T09:05:22Z;UK housebuilding grows at fastest pace for 10 years;;Construction activity in the UK’s housing market grew at its fastest pace for almost a decade in September, suggesting the controversial government-backed Help to Buy scheme is boosting the supply of new homes.In the latest purchasing managers’ index, the figure for residential construction climbed to 64.8 – its highest since November 2003 and well above the crucial 50 point that separates an expansion in activity from a contraction.Nearly all of the UK’s largest housebuilders have been buying land at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis, anticipating a steep rise in construction to sate soaring demand thanks to the first stage of Help to Buy.Barratt, the UK’s largest housebuilder by volume, said it would increase its output to 16,000 units a year by 2016, from a projected 13,600 for this year. Others have declined to set targets and warned of labour and materials shortages as the industry struggles to adjust to the increase in demand.“Looking forward, the [PMI] shows orders and employment rising,” said Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association. “Expect to see further rises in activity in housing, with larger rises in house prices and house building.”Construction companies added jobs at the quickest rate since December 2007, according to the index, which is compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply and includes figures for the commercial and civil engineering subsectors. Business expectations were at their highest level since April 2010.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, said: “Strength in construction means more jobs and is vital for tackling the UK’s housing shortage. This is a credit to the resilience of our construction industry and it’s really encouraging to see confidence rising in the sector.”David Cameron, prime minister, said on Sunday that he would bring forward the launch of the second stage of Help to Buy to this week, rather than wait until January.While the first stage incentivises the construction industry to build homes by offering loans for new-build properties, the second stage is primarily aimed at first-time buyers who only have enough for a small deposit.The overall construction PMI fell to 58.9 from 59.1 the previous month. This was slightly below analysts’ expectations, but still represents a substantial expansion.Commercial building activity was also up, though the figure for civil engineering fell by more than 4 percentage points. It is the fifth consecutive month that activity in construction – the sector hit hardest by the financial crisis – has expanded.Tim Moore, economist at Markit, said: “Construction is no longer the weakest link in the UK economy,” adding: “September’s survey suggested constructors are beginning to react with confidence.”The building industry contracted almost a fifth during the financial crisis and output remains well below its 2008 peak.Kate Orviss, infrastructure partner at Pinsent Masons, a construction law firm, said: “Although a rebound is under way, there is still a long way to go before the construction industry will see activity anywhere near levels seen before the financial crisis.”
491;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-01T17:40:22Z;Markit appoints Gooch as CFO;;Markit, the financial data provider, has appointed Jeff Gooch, head of its trade processing business MarkitServ, as chief financial officer, according to two people familiar with the situation.Mr Gooch perviously served as chief executive of MarkitServ for more than four years. Mr Gooch joined Markit six years ago and has also worked at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Ernst & Young. Mr Gooch is expected to be replaced by Brad Levy, who joined the company from Goldman Sachs last year, the people said.The appointment comes amid frequent speculation this year that Markit may look for a stock market listing in the coming months. However the London-based company, headed by entrepreneur Lance Uggla, has always maintained it has not made any decision to pursue a public listing.Originally a data provider of prices and valuations of privately traded credit derivatives, Markit has rapidly expanded in a decade through acquisition to a financial data empire that has made inroads into a market dominated by Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.The MarkitServ business headed by Mr Gooch has been one of the fastest-growing parts of Markit in recent years as new rules force more trades onto electronic networks. The unit processes electronic trades for the over-the-counter derivatives market and aims to provide an industry utility credit checking service for a host of new US swaps trading venues.Founded in 2009, it has signed up 2,500 customers who have their OTC trades affirmed. Earlier this year Markit bought out the share held by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation in the joint venture.
492;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-01T09:37:01Z;Asia PMIs: signs of improvement;;"There has been a bit of a turnaround in sentiment in Asian manufacturing from August to September. The purchasing managers index (PMI) readings for six major Asian economies paint a more optimistic picture – just.The Asia PMI scorecard shows that August’s red is turning blue – with three indices moving above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.The FT reported the slightly disappointing China reading on Monday. Although the PMI is still in positive territory at 50.2, September’s flash PMI (an early reading) had indicated a much higher score of 51.2. The flash reading doesn’t usually diverge that much.HSBC described China’s PMI as “fractional”.In India, the PMI reading improved, but was still below 50, with manufacturers pointing to lower levels of incoming new work and economic instability.Leif Eskesen, Chief Economist for India & ASEAN at HSBC said:Manufacturing activity continued to shrink in September, albeit at a slower pace. Order flows remain weak, especially export orders, and employment fell. Moreover, businesses cut back quantity and stocks of purchases. While output prices rose at a slower pace, input prices rose markedly, as the effects of the weaker exchange rate continue to pass through. Despite the weak growth readings, the build-up in underlying inflation pressures suggests that the RBI has to keep its inflation guards up.Indonesia “crawled” above the 50 mark, according to analysts, up to 50.2 after a disappointing August reading.Su Sian Lim of HSBC noted thatManufacturing conditions improved in September, but we remain cautious. The PMI and output indices are only marginally above 50, while new orders continued to contract, reflecting that output rose only because firms were working through their work backlogs. Going forward, cooling domestic demand on the back of tightening policies by the central bank and government is likely to mean a further slowdown for the manufacturing sector.In Taiwan, the reading was a healthier 52.0, the first positive reading since April. Output, total new orders and new export orders all increased for the first time in five months. Overseas business was stronger from China, the US and Europe.HSBC’s verdict: “Taiwan’s stronger PMI reading confirms our view that its manufacturing sector has stabilised in the third quarter. This is positive for the economy’s growth outlook as it heads towards year-end.”South Korea, like India, was close to 50 but still just below. It was the highest score in four months and suggests “a near-stabilisation of business conditions”.Lastly, Vietnam registered a PMI of 51.5, the highest since April 2011 which was when the index began. New business and employment were the drivers behind the higher score, and foreign sales also improved.HSBC noted that the PMI was “reflective of improved global demand for Vietnamese goods as well as a stabilisation of domestic conditions.”Related reading:

493;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-10-01T09:26:14Z;UK manufacturing activity continues steady growth;;UK manufacturing activity continued to expand in September but at a slower pace than in August, according to a closely watched poll of purchasing managers.The manufacturing index, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, dipped to 56.7 in September, from 57.1 in August – the highest reading for two and a half years.Though analysts had expected activity to expand at a quicker pace, the September figure remains well above the crucial level of 50 that marks an expansion in activity. It is the sixth month in a row that manufacturing activity has expanded.“UK manufacturing continues to boom, adding to the flow of upbeat data which suggest that the economy is growing faster than almost anyone expected,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. “These numbers are encouraging in respect to the rebalancing of the economy, with goods production likely to provide a major stimulus to economic growth in the third quarter.”Companies added more jobs at the fastest pace since May 2011, with more workers helping to clear backlogs of work.New orders were down slightly, with most of the lift continuing to come from strong domestic demand. The growth in export orders slowed.“Businesses will be hoping overseas demand can match that at home. This will be the key to unlocking continued growth,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.Cost pressures also eased from the highs witnessed in August.
494;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-30T09:32:29Z;China PMIs: big difference;;"The Markit / HSBC purchasing managers index is a closely-watched number, and for good reason. The PMIs give a good reading of momentum in industry, which is often borne out by the subsequent industrial production figures.The flash version – an early reading that comes out a week or so before the main index – is keenly watched too, and is usually close to the final figure. But look what happened to China this month. The September flash PMI was 51.2. The actual PMI? 50.2. That’s quite a difference. What’s going on?In fact, this is the biggest difference for a long time – at least 30 months or more. The charts below show the Flash PMI vs the actual reading, with data going back to March 2011 (lastest available on Bloomberg). UPDATE: this is the biggest divergence since December 2009, according to analysts.The PMI readings track each other very closely: in the period observed, there was only one month (January 2012) where the indices moved in opposite directions.And market-watchers have got used to the Flash PMI being pretty much spot on this year. Since February 2013, the flash and actual PMIs have been close or identical, with only May’s reading showing any significant difference (0.4 points).So the 1-point difference in September looks like quite a blip. HSBC say that “The estimate is typically based on approximately 85%–90% of total PMI survey responses each month and is designed to provide an accurate indication of the final PMI data.”At least the reading was still in positive territory. That still didn’t stop HSBC giving a fairly gloomy prognonsis for the Chinese economy, saying that “Growth is bottoming out on Beijing’s mini-stimulus. We expect continuous policy efforts to sustain the recovery.”But what could be behind such a divergence? The final 10 to 15 per cent of responses have moved the index quite substantially.Annabel Fiddes, economist at Markit, told beyondbrics in an email that “The slight divergence was caused by more companies reporting no change or down in the closing days of data collection, for which we cannot attribute any definitive explanation. In particular, the extraction & energy sector signalled no-change or reduced levels of output and new orders.”Capital Economics Chief Asia economist Mark Williams was equally puzzled by the PMIs, and offered two theories.One possibility is that the economic rebound has suddenly run out of steam… But the turnaround today’s figures point to is far more abrupt than we would expect.Another theory is that typhoon Usagi, which temporarily shut down coastal areas of southern China last week, was responsible. There are two ways this could work. Firms responding later in the month would be more likely to reflect the disruption in their survey response. It may also be that the flash release incorporated fewer responses than usual as many firms were closed to avoid the typhoon. The later responders would therefore be those worst affected by the weather.Whatever the reason, as Williams points out it will be interesting to see the official government PMI which is out on Tuesday. It has more heavy industry and fewer coastal manufacturers.Related reading:

495;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-24T17:29:15Z;WH Smith bears feeling the heat;;WH Smith bears have already been squeezed. The newsagent is London’s second-most disliked large-cap stock with short interest peaking in January at nearly a quarter of its free float. Since then, the shares have jumped 30 per cent.Full-year results next month provide the next trigger for the bears, who still account for nearly 14 per cent of WH Smith’s free float according to Markit data.Yet with the retailer already reassuring that it would meet forecasts, analysts reckon the squeeze will continue.New chief executive Steve Clarke was likely to use the results to raise cost savings guidance and reload a £50m share buyback fund, said Barclays.The broker also expected news of more contract wins for WH Smith’s international travel concessions business, which it said could be worth 160p per share by 2016 yet was “ignored in the current valuation”.Barclays set a 935p target price on WH Smith, which closed up 2.9 per cent at 841.5p.A trend-free wider market left the FTSE 100 up 0.2 per cent, or 14.09 points, at 6,571.46.Carnival led the fallers, down 5.6 per cent to £22.58 after the cruise operator’s guidance on trading and costs sliced more than 25 per cent off 2014 earnings expectations.Shire faded 1.2 per cent to £24.89. Having hit a record high last week, Shire has slipped on talk of possible US acquisitons and as dealers picked up on US prescription data showing lacklustre sales growth for its Vyvanse hyperactivity drug.Amec lost 1.5 per cent to £10.91 after a downgrade to “neutral” from UBS.The broker saw patchy demand for engineering and design work and slower decision-making to award power projects as well as increasing competitive rivalry in a fragmented industry.While Amec can return between £80m and £100m a year to shareholders, underlying earnings momentum was likely to turn negative in the near term, UBS said.J Sainsbury rose 0.7 per cent to 398p after industry data showed its sales growth continuing to outpace rivals. Poor non-food sales held back Tesco, down 0.5 per cent to 374p ahead of results next week.Ocado was down 4.6 per cent to 381p, a move dealers put down to profit taking following a long-running short squeeze.The grocery delivery group hit a record high of 435p last week amid hopes it will license its logistics systems internationally, a move analysts at Redburn Partners reckoned might be worth an additional 550p per share.Afren drifted 1.7 per cent to 142.8p. Chief executive Osman Shahenshah said in an interview that Afren’s share of production from Ebok, the Nigerian project that provides about 70 per cent of its output, would be halved next year because it had reached a cost-recovery threshold.Afren was “effectively warning the market that production will be lower by the end of this year,” said VSA Capital.“We would suggest that investors take profits ahead of formal production guidance being given.”Aim-listed Max Petroleum rose 13.9 per cent to 4.1p on word that a share overhang had cleared, and as retail punters were animated by a seemingly innocuous statement from the Kazakhstan oil explorer noting a rule change that meant it would be subject the City’s takeover code from September 30.Previously, companies without registered offices in the UK were exempt from the code.
496;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-23T13:05:27Z;Hong Kong inflation slips;China PMI at highest level in six months;The “no-taper rally” has eased and the eurozone’s plodding recovery was underscored by business activity data. China’s manufacturing data indicates that it may be headed for a soft landing, after all.European manufacturing is still weak, but the eurozone as a whole is headed towards a gradual improvement. Analysts at Barclays stressed that both services and manufacturing “employment rose . . . which tends to signal greater confidence about future projects and adds to evidence that the deterioration in the labour market has slowed recently. This could have positive implications for consumer confidence and, ultimately, on private consumption.”Asia PacificHong Kong: The composite consumer price index slipped to 4.5 per cent year on year in August from 6.9 per cent in July. The underlying inflation rate, which cuts out the effects of one-off government measures, moved up slightly to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent as the cost of private housing rentals, saltwater fish and package tours increased.Housing prices were up 6.8 per cent year on year in August, compared with the 15.1 per cent increase in July. The slower pace of growth was driven by a drop in the public rental sector, where prices gained 0.5 per cent in August. Utilities prices also gained momentum, growing 10.2 per cent compared with the 9.3 per cent registered the month before. Analysts at 4Cast said imported inflation remained benign.Singapore: Consumer price inflation rose to 2 per cent in August from 1.9 per cent in July, as accommodation costs climbed 4.2 per cent year on year in August after a 2.6 per cent rise in July.Taiwan: The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.19 in August from 4.18 per cent the month before. The labour force participation rate also increased to 58.66 per cent from 58.55 per cent the month before.China: The flash PMI reached 51.2, its highest level for six months. Hongbin Qu, chief economist at HSBC, said: “The firmer footing was supported by simultaneous improvements of external and domestic demand conditions. We expect a more sustained recovery as the further filtering-through of fine-tuning measures should lift domestic demand.”EuropeTurkey: Tourist arrivals spiked 10.6 per cent year on year in August to 4.945m, exceeding the 4.593m foreign arrivals recorded in July, the traditional peak month for tourist visits. The August figures also boosted the year-to-date arrivals to 24.1m, up 10.6 per cent from the year before, but analysts at 4Cast did point out that a “fresh outburst of anti-government protests in September and prevailing geopolitical risk surrounding Syria may still dent the underlying trend and prevent Turkish arrivals from exceeding the all time record high of almost 32m set last year.”Eurozone: Flash numbers show the composite PMI for September rose to 52.1 from 51.5 in August. The service sector index climbed to 52.1 from 50.7, while the manufacturing survey fell to 51.1 from 51.4.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The overall rate of growth signalled by the eurozone PMI remains modest . . . consistent with gross domestic product rising by a meagre 0.2 per cent in the third quarter. While rising inflows of new business bode well for a further upturn in the fourth quarter, policy makers at the ECB will no doubt view it as too early to change their stance on keeping policy on hold for an extended period.”Germany: A better than expected performance in the services PMI countered a slowdown in manufacturing PMI, to lift the composite PMI to 53.8 in September from 53.5 in August. Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said: “Positive signs from the German economy are a crucial factor underpinning global business confidence at present, especially while some momentum has been lost across emerging markets.”AmericasColombia: Retail sales rose 5.4 per cent year on year in July, accelerating from the 4.1 per cent increase seen in June.
497;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-15T21:05:11Z;Global banks in talks to set up joint checks on customers;;Large global banks including HSBC and Morgan Stanley are in talks to set up industry-wide services for money laundering and terrorist finance checks, as stricter regulation is forcing them to reduce costs by pooling resources.Bankers and consultants said there was a flurry of discussions with data management and technology groups including Markit, The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Swift and Lysis Financial about joint checks of corporate and institutional customers.US outsourcing group Genpact and London-based financial information firm Markit will announce the first such partnership to create an industry-wide service for screening new clients and managing customer reference data on Monday.HSBC and Morgan Stanley are among the banks that will work with the two groups on the design of the service, aimed at slashing banks’ costs and improving compliance with a string of new rules in this area.The move comes less than a year after a $1.9bn US fine paid by HSBC in a money-laundering scandal raised the alarm bells at global banks’ boards over potential costs of violating so-called “know your customer” regulation.Those rules force banks to use software and other data gathering tools to identify risky or suspicious client accounts to combat money laundering, sanction breaches and the financing of terrorism.Rather than each bank maintaining separate, overlapping files on customers, banks are considering pooling information about them in a “library” that would be available to all but owned and operated by a third party.Yet some of the talks go beyond that by including the actual process of data gathering and even counterparty risk assessments.“We are working with some clients to truly outsource a large part of it,” said Stephen Racioppo, chief revenue officer of Broadridge. “There is a tremendous opportunity to mutualise costs.”“There are lots of economic reasons for creating one utility serving the whole banking industry,” said Jon Sweet, chief executive of at Lysis Financial, a London-based consulting and outsourcing group that is also involved in such talks.DTCC, a US-based post-trade provider owned by banks, is already in the process of building a platform that could act as industry-wide provider for such data, people close to the situation said.The talks in one of the industry’s most sensitive areas highlight how a plethora of stricter regulation is forcing even the largest global banks to give up their notorious unwillingness to co-operate.Under pressure to improve lacklustre returns, banks are now seriously considering ways to slash costs by pooling resources particularly in the space of information technology, traditionally one of their biggest fixed costs.Banks’ expenditures for growing demands from know your customer regulation alone will rise from $800m to up to $1.25bn in the next three years, according to estimates by SunGard Consulting Services.Jeffrey Wallis, SunGard Consulting Services’ president, estimates that banks could reduce those costs by around half via outsourcing. “This is not without precedence. It is happening all the time around the world with credit scores so why can’t this model be applied to know your customer data?”
498;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-08T23:00:00Z;Regional activity soars at fastest rate for more than a decade;;The combined business activity of England’s regions rose last month at the fastest rate for more than a decade, raising hopes that the quickening economic recovery will be widely spread.Wales recorded its strongest rate of expansion for almost four years, while growth in Scotland and Northern Ireland also accelerated, according to the Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers’ index.Expansion was fastest in northwest England, followed by the southeast, southwest and London. All 12 UK regions registered growth, with only the northeast and Yorkshire and the Humber seeing a slowing in the rate of expansion.Companies cited a wide range of factors that had boosted business activity, including higher consumer demand and greater investment spending among public and private sector clients.Some businesses also reported rising volumes of export sales. All areas of England and Wales reported an increase in incoming new work.The headline index measuring overall UK business activity rose to 60.8, up from 59.8 in July. The average for England was 61, the highest since the series began in 2001.A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity, according to data company Markit, which compiles the survey.David Oldfield, managing director for small and medium-sized enterprises and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “The most encouraging aspect of the recent increase in business activity is that it has fuelled job creation across the private sector.“We have seen employment growth across England and Wales this summer and all the signs are that we should expect more of this good news over the coming months.”Private sector companies across all nine English regions took on new staff during August, with the West Midlands recording the strongest rate of job creation.The coalition wants to “rebalance” the economy, with an emphasis on manufacturing, exports, investment and faster growth outside London and the southeast.This has proved elusive, but the signs so far are that the latest recovery is more broadly based. London, which grew faster than the rest of the country in the years before the crash, appears to be recovering at an above-average rate, but it is not pulling sharply ahead.Fears of a housing bubble have been dismissed as “hype’” by a Bank of England policy maker, days after governor Mark Carney said the bank was prepared to intervene to cool an overheated property market.The remarks by Paul Fisher appear to suggest that conditions are a long way off a point where the action threatened by Mr Carney to keep a lid on unsustainable price growth would be necessary.His comments in a newspaper interview come as Halifax figures showed house prices were 5.4 per cent higher than last summer.
499;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Hungary, Australia, Argentina;Sluggish recovery across Europe;Eurozone services expanded for the first time in just over a year and a half while the composite index rose on the back of improved domestic demand and a strong performance from Germany, the regular powerhouse. Don’t get too excited though – the recovery has yet to filter through to the labour market and analysts have emphasised that a recovery in the region will be modest.Data from the Asia Pacific region continues to reflect concerns over uncertain market conditions.EuropeEurozone: Seasonally-adjusted retail sales rose 0.1 per cent month on month in July, bringing the year on year rate down to -1.3 per cent.The services PMI returned to growth for the first time in over a year and a half, edging up to 50.7 in August from 49.8 in July. Together with the manufacturing PMI of 51.4, this has helped push the composite PMI to 51.5.The two-year high was aided by German services, which expanded more than expected with a reading of 52.8. The composite output index for Germany reached a seven-month high of 53.5 in August. Job creation was maintained across the service sector, while new business volumes rose moderately.France: The rise in the services PMI showed that business activity fell at a slower rate in August. The rate of job losses eased and positive sentiment about future business activity, at its highest point since May 2012, helped the index rise slightly from 48.6 to 48.9.Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit, said, “An improvement in service providers’ future expectations to the highest for more than a year provides further positive news, although the overall picture remains far from rosy.”A 3.3 per cent month-on-month increase in petroleum prices pushed producer prices up 0.7 per cent in July. Prices for electricity and gas rebounded, rising 2.8 per cent month-on-month. The producer price index was up 0.3 per cent year on year.UK: The services sector beat expectations by growing at its fastest rate since December 2006 in August. The rise in new work was the largest since 1997 and helped the PMI rise to 60.5, well above the 50 mark, which separates contraction from expansion.Norway: The current account surplus widened in the second quarter of this year to NOK89.9bn from 85.5bn in the first quarter.Czech Republic: The current account showed a deficit of €196.7m in the second quarter of this year, down from a surplus of €534.4m in the first quarter. An increase in the goods and services surplus meant the deficit has dropped to 2 per cent of GDP from 2.5 per cent. The growth of dividends paid to non-residents on portfolio and direct investment pushed the income deficit to CZK73.7bn.Sales of motor vehicles helped retail sales grow 4 per cent year on year after they contracted 2.5 per cent in June. The sales and repair of motor vehicles added 3 percentage points to the headline figure, with another percentage point coming from non food goods.Analysts at 4Cast pointed out that consumer spending remains weak and said they still saw a subdued pace of retail growth in the coming months. In working day adjusted terms, sales increased 0.7 per cent year-on-year.Italy: The services PMI moved up less than expected to 48.8 in August from 48.7 in July. The rate of contraction was the slowest in two years, though business activity and employment continued to fall. Input prices and charges continued to diverge.Spain: The service sector returned to growth in August, ending two years of decline. New business increased and backlogs of work fell at the slowest pace since June 2011, helping the index pop up to 50.4 in August from 48.5 in July.Andrew Harker, a senior economist at Harker, noted that: “Concerns remain, however, and this is highlighted by a quickening pace of job cuts despite rising workloads. Companies are reluctant to hire workers while solid, sustainable growth remains elusive and the outlook is still an uncertain one.”Russia: The services PMI returned to expansion, bouncing up to 51.8 from 48.7. This was helped by the strongest pace of job creation since May. However, “there are not reasons for much optimism”, said Alexander Morozov, chief economist at HSBC. “We do not expect renewed growth to get much stronger momentum from here. The recent oil price rally can help only marginally in boosting growth, we think. Indeed, it is the recent surge in geopolitical risks on the back of events in Egypt and Syria that drove oil prices higher, rather than a sustainable improvement in oil market fundamentals that remain pretty weak.”Industry took 0.2 percentage points off growth, though this was offset by construction. State sponsored construction helped investments rise 8.7 per cent year-on-year. Real consumption, investment and net exports all declined.“The ongoing economic recovery on key export markets should help the industry to perform,” said analysts at 4Cast. However, they added that “with fresh taxes still weighing on growth, the recovery is set to be sluggish”.July’s retail sales rose 1.2 per cent from the year before, after sales in June slipped 0.4 per cent year-on-year in June. The rebound followed a weak performance in June after flooding.Sweden: The final services PMI figure showed the index slipped to 53.7 in August after rising to 56.6 the month before.Ireland: Services PMI rose to 61.6 in August from 57.6 in July, helped by growth in all sectors. Philip O’Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland said, “According to respondents, the principal cause of rising activity in August was the spell of unusually good weather in Ireland and the consequent boost to the tourism sector.”Asia PacificSingapore: The August purchasing managers’ index showed the seventh straight month of recovery in the electronics sector, though the manufacturing sector overall grew less than expected. The electronics PMI rose one point to a three-month high of 51.3 on the back of stronger orders and growing exports.Japan: The Business Activity Index rose to 51.2 in August from 50.6 in July, continuing the longest period of sustained growth recorded since the index series began in September 2007. It was helped by higher volumes of new orders. The composite output index rose to 51.9 from 50.7 on the back of this and the fastest rise in output from goods producers since February 2011.Hong Kong: The purchasing managers’ index registered a contraction for the fifth consecutive month. It remained below the 50 mark at 49.7 as volumes of new business declined amid weaker market conditions.Australia: The economy grew 2.6 per cent year on year in the second quarter of this year, marginally beating expectations. The services PMI continued its steady decline and slipped in August to 39 from 39.4 the month before. The rate of contraction sped up in the employment and delivery components of the index, while the wage and input price sub-indices are above the average levels seen in the past three years.Close to one in five businesses noted that the most important factor affecting activity was “uncertainty” associated with the forthcoming federal election.India: The service PMI slipped to 47.6 in August from 47.9 in July. The fastest contraction was seen in transport and storage companies. This, coupled with a contraction in manufacturing output, pulled the composite index down to 47.6 from 48.4. Input cost inflation accelerated to its highest points in six months while new orders fell at the fastest pace in almost four and a half years.HSBC reported that “Anecdotal evidence suggested that an uncertain economic outlook had damped client confidence.”AmericasUS: The trade deficit widened to $39bn in July as exports fell 0.6 per cent and imports rose 1.6 per cent.Argentina: The “Leading Indicator” of economic activity rose for the fourth consecutive month in July to 189.6. The diffusion index, which measured the spread of the increase or decrease in different sectors, was dragged down from 60 per cent in June to 50 per cent in July by industry and shop centre sales. The probability of expansion was measured at 98 per cent.Analysts at 4Cast said that “while the results add evidence of uneven economic growth, they also point to a brief respite in growth indicators that could trigger a GDP warrant payment in 2014 [3.22% GDP in 2013 is needed to trigger a payment].”
500;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-04T09:22:08Z;Service sector grows at fastest rate for 6 years;;"Activity in the UK’s dominant services sector grew at its fastest rate for more than six years in August, according to a poll of purchasing managers, which also showed the rise in new work was the largest since 1997.The UK purchasing managers’ index of 700 services companies, compiled by data company Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, a trade body, rose to 60.5 in August, confounding analysts’ expectations it would fall from the 60.2 figure recorded for July.The result, which is well above the crucial 50 figure that separates expansion in activity from contraction, is the highest since December 2006.The all-sector PMI published this week, which takes into account the strong results for the manufacturing and construction industries, hit its highest level since the series began in 1998.“The surveys are clearly signalling a pace of expansion well above that anticipated by policy makers,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “This exacerbates the challenge faced by the Bank of England in justifying ultra-loose policy for the timeframe envisaged.”The Monetary Policy Committee said last month it intends to keep the bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent at least until unemployment falls below 7 per cent. Policy makers expect this will not happen until the middle of 2016.The services poll showed the fastest rise in new business since May 1997. Backlogs of work rose by the most since February 2000. However, the improvement in the jobs market was only marginal; the employment component of the survey fell to its lowest level since December, with relatively few businesses adding workers.Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said: “Perhaps the only disappointment for August was little change in employment. However, if activity and sales can maintain their current growth velocities, then higher payrolls and, just as important for many workers, increased wages, should hopefully follow.”"
501;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-09-03T17:44:22Z;Hedge funds caught short by Nokia deal;;A 34 per cent jump in Nokia’s share price was down to not just relief at the Finnish group jettisoning its lossmaking mobile business but also a short squeeze among hedge funds.Nokia was one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the European market with 11.9 per cent of its shares out on loan as of last week, according to data provider Markit.Short sellers, typically hedge funds, borrow the stock from existing shareholders in a bet that they will be able to buy it back cheaper in the future. But they are notoriously vulnerable to a so-called short squeeze when a big news event breaks such as Microsoft’s deal to pay €5.4bn for Nokia’s mobile phone business.“Nokia has historically had a massive short. Part of the reason is it’s in a volatile industry and losing share. It’s also very widely held and a lot of the longs [existing shareholders] put it out to borrow. It’s not surprising that there is a massive short cover today among hedge funds,” said one person involved in the Microsoft deal.Investors with big Nokia short positions include Discovery Capital Management, Viking Global Investors, Blue Ridge Capital, Lone Pine Capital and Maverick Capital, according to data from Bloomberg.Markit said: “Demand to borrow has been very heavy with two-thirds of the shares that can be borrowed from lending programmes being out on loan.”Trading volumes were already 10 times their daily average in early afternoon as investors digested the news that Nokia was turning its back on mobile phones. People close to Nokia also underlined how investors could have been impressed by the sales price, given that many analysts assigned no or little value to the Finnish group’s mobile business due to its chronic lossmaking position.“This was a good deal at a great price for Nokia. And the rest of the company is in not bad shape so maybe some people will reassess its prospects now,” a person close to Nokia added.Nokia’s shares closed up 34 per cent at €3.97 on Tuesday but that only brings them to a level they were last at in April 2012.Another sign of investor surprise at the deal came from the credit derivatives market. Nokia’s CDS spreads – a measure of how likely it is to go bankrupt – traded at about 200 basis points on Tuesday, down from 534bps at Monday’s close, according to Markit. That means it costs $200,000 to insure $10m of Nokia’s debt against default. Spreads were as wide as 1,000bps last October.
502;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK construction activity surges as housebuilding drives recovery;;Activity in the construction sector rose at its fastest pace in six years in August, in the latest sign that weaker parts of the economy are beginning to benefit from the pick-up in demand.The closely watched purchasing managers’ index for construction, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, registered 59.1, up from 57 in July and its highest reading since September 2007.It is the fourth successive month that the reading has come in above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity. The figure beat analysts’ expectations.The construction industry, which makes up between 6 and 7 per cent of the economy, was hard hit by the crisis.Though output still remains 16 per cent below its pre-crisis peak, the housebuilding industry, boosted by the government’s Help to Buy scheme, has driven a recovery in recent months.The August PMI was particularly encouraging as it showed the fastest rise in activity in the weaker civil engineering sector for almost six years, with the reading rising to 59.9, from 51.1 in July. Commercial construction activity also registered the sharpest increase since May 2012.“Builders have seen a step change in recent months and are now starting to show their true potential to the UK economy,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.“This new direction brings new challenges, not least the prospect of additional work and insufficient capacity to meet demand. How the sector navigates these tensions and manages the supply chain could come to define its performance over the coming months.”However, despite the strong reading, construction companies are yet to add many jobs. The figure for employment declined from July, though it remained above the 50 mark.Housebuilding was still the best-performing part of the industry, with a reading of activity rising at its fastest pace for three years. New orders rose at their fastest pace since March 2012, suggesting activity will remain strong in the months ahead.
503;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-15T16:48:12Z;Food and drink help UK retail sales to soar in the sunshine;;Retailers enjoyed a bumper month in July, with sales volumes soaring at their fastest pace for more than two-and-a-half years, as shoppers stocked up on food and alcohol during the longest heatwave for more than 15 years.Retail sales by volume were 3 per cent higher compared with July 2012 – the sharpest rise since early 2011. The Office for National Statistics said month-on-month sales rose 1.1 per cent between June and July, beating analysts’ expectations.The July figures mean that retail sales enjoyed their best three months since early 2008 and helped fuel hopes of a strong growth figure in the third quarter.Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data group Markit, said: “This pace of growth is unlikely to persist, but a further upturn in consumer confidence, an improving labour market, rising house prices and greater confidence that interest rates will stay low for longer should all help ensure that consumer spending plays a role in helping to sustain the recovery.”July’s heatwave was the longest period of hot weather in the UK since 1997. As temperatures soared as high as 33.5°C, shoppers hit the supermarkets, where sales climbed by 2.5 per cent. The supermarkets told the ONS that sunshine had encouraged people to spend more on food, alcohol, clothing and other outdoor items.The July figures follow months of steady growth for the sector.Grocers dominate the UK retail sector. For every £1 spent last month, 42p went to food stores. Last month, shoppers spent about £7bn a week in total – up from £6.8bn in June and £6.7bn in July 2012.Asda posted a 0.7 per cent jump in like-for-like sales for the three months to July 5. However, Andy Clarke, chief executive of the supermarket, said the current retailing environment remained “tough”.Waitrose has enjoyed a strong start to the second half of the year, thanks in part to sales of beer.Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said the sector could struggle to grow at the same pace in the months ahead. “I suspect it’s a blip,” he said. “It was food-driven performance – driven by the weather – with people going barbecue-crazy. The weather hasn’t been repeated in August and people can’t keep spending as much.”Separate ONS data published on Thursday showed Britons were wealthier on average thanks to rising house prices.The estimated net worth of households increased by £410bn between 2011 and 2012, thanks in large part to an increase in the value of houses and flats.“Dwellings” account for about 60 per cent of the country’s £7.3tn net worth. “Our analysis suggests a similar upward trend is likely in 2013,” said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC professional services.“Wealthier households will tend to feel more confident about spending more, as reflected in today’s relatively strong retail sales data. This should help to keep the UK economy on the road to recovery.”The country’s net worth – which works out to £114,000 per person – was also given a £2.3bn lift after statisticians added the value of “personalised or cherished number plates” to their calculations.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent.

It was one of the strongest signs yet of recovery in the world’s sixth-biggest economy, which has been seen as a laggard among its biggest international peers since the financial crisis.A composite index for the UK, based on surveys of the services, manufacturing and construction sectors, was the highest of all the major economies. In addition, industry data showed the biggest real increase in retail sales in July for two years.“Evidence is mounting that the UK economy is achieving ‘escape velocity’,” said Ross Walker, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.The data come at a significant moment in the UK. The Bank of England will on Wednesday publish its most important quarterly “inflation report” in years, as new governor Mark Carney is set to unveil a framework for so-called “forward guidance” to markets and the public on how long the Monetary Policy Committee intends to keep interest rates at record low levels.Jens Larsen, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the better data would not deter the BoE from implementing “forward guidance”.“It is exactly in the current circumstances – where UK growth is picking up and where monetary policy in the US is set to normalise – where it is important to temper expectations for a quick increase in [interest rates],” he said.Britain is in the middle of an eight-year programme of spending cuts and tax increases to try to close its budget deficit, which has put it at the centre of the global debate over the merits of austerity.The Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s fiscal watchdog, forecast in March the economy would grow just 0.6 per cent this year. But since then, the median forecast among economists has increased to about 1 per cent.George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank, on Monday raised his UK growth forecasts from 1.1 per cent to 1.4 per cent for this year, and from 1.8 per cent to 2.1 per cent for next year.But he agreed the data would not change the BoE’s plans. “What’s worrying them is that the economy remains fairly fragile, in the sense that the level of output is still very weak,” he said. Britain’s economy remains more than 3 per cent smaller than before the financial crisis.The purchasing managers’ index for services, produced by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, rose to 60.2, up from 56.9 in June and well above the critical 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity.While the PMI surveys are not official data, they are seen as useful indicators of economic momentum.The data come amid rising service-sector activity around the world. In the US, the expansion was the fastest in seven months, according to the Institute for Supply Management.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Doing my bit for booming Britain / From Mr Simon Broomer
506;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-05T13:09:58Z;Egypt: PMI drop shows extent of economic problems;;"Tough times in Egypt: on top of all the political turmoil, the latest manufacturing index has fallen off a cliff to its second-lowest since the numbers began.The Markit/HSBC purchasing managers’ index came in at a lowly 41.7 in July, down from 47.5 in June (50 marks the border between expansion and contraction) The longer the political uncertainly goes on, the harder it will be for Egypt to recover.The country’s non-oil manufacturing sector saw a decline in employment for the 15th consecutive month, while both output and new orders saw their second-sharpest drop in the 28-month history of the index.Political problems are having a direct effect, as well as hurting sentiment. According to HSBC, “suppliers’ delivery times worsened further and respondents attributed this to road closures caused by protests and the ongoing political instability in the country.”This from Simon Williams, HSBC’s chief economist for the Middle East:The poor print underscores the enormous costs ongoing turmoil continues to impose on the Egyptian economy. Political order is a prerequisite for recovery, but even if that is achieved, it will prove very challenging to quickly reverse the losses of the past 10 months.Egypt’s central bank hasn’t sat on its hands. Last week it surprised analysts by cutting rates by 50 basis points, putting the benchmark overnight deposit rate at 9.75 per cent, a move that shows it is less worried about inflation than it is about growth.However, inflation is still high: the headline rate was 9.75 per cent in June, up from 8.2 per cent in May, and analysts think it could edge up higher still.Looking at the bank’s decision to cut, Stephen Bailey-Smith of Standard Bank said in a note:The CBE’s move clearly suggests it does not see inflation going much higher, which can only really mean one thing: it now believes it has sufficient resources to protect the currency without heavily real interest rates.And although the country has recently secured $12bn in funding in aid from Gulf states, Egypt wants to restart IMF talks over a possible financing package.But as Jason Tuvey, economist at Capital Economics put it:we doubt that the current government has the mandate to implement the reforms that would form part of the IMF’s lending conditions.Related reading:

507;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-05T09:07:59Z;Surge in services fuels UK recovery hopes;;Activity in the UK’s dominant services sector expanded at the fastest pace for more than 6½ years in July, according to an influential poll of purchasing managers.The survey, which smashed economists’ expectations, is the latest sign the UK’s economic recovery is gathering strength.The purchasing managers’ index for services, produced by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, rose to 60.2 last month, up from 56.9 in June and well above the crucial 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity. Sterling recovered early losses on the news.The strong services PMI follows better than expected readings last week for the manufacturing and construction sectors. The composite PMI is now at its highest level since the series began.The data come ahead of the publication on Wednesday of the Bank of England’s most important inflation report in years, when new governor Mark Carney is set to unveil a framework for so-called “forward guidance” to markets and the public on how long the Monetary Policy Committee intends to keep interest rates at record-low levels.George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said the good news did not mean the BoE would abandon its plan to offer guidance.“What’s worrying them is that the economy remains fairly fragile, in the sense that the level of output is still very weak,” he said. Britain’s economy remains more than 3 per cent smaller than before the financial crisis. “It’s almost like they’re thinking . . . we need to be very careful about allowing the market to run away with itself and think this is the start of much higher interest rates.”However, Richard Barwell, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the strong PMIs, coupled with inflation above the BoE’s 2 per cent target, would hinder Mr Carney’s ability to use guidance to loosen monetary policy.“If Mark Carney is trying to use guidance to put more weight on growth and take a more activist approach to monetary policy, which is what he had originally intended, then it’s an awkward time to do this, he said.”Markit said the rise in demand for services, which make up more than three-quarters of all economic output, had placed pressure on capacity, leading to the sharpest climb in backlogs of new work since February 2000.The reading for new business rose at its fastest pace since November 2006, signalling activity will remain strong in the months ahead.“Although an early call on one month’s data, the forward-looking element from the survey point to a further strengthening of GDP in the third quarter as the UK heads towards escape velocity and a self-sustaining economic expansion,” said Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit.Mr Smith said business services and information technology companies were among those that had performed particularly well.While there are signs the manufacturing and construction sectors are also starting to grow again, the services sector remains the principal engine of recovery.David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the sector was also more likely than manufacturing to boost Britain’s net exports.“Trade in goods will remain very important, but closing our trade deficit will have to rely increasingly on services,” he said. In the BCC’s latest quarterly survey, service sector companies reported the fastest export growth since the survey started in 1989.
508;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-02T16:40:23Z;UK construction activity grows at fastest rate since 2010;;Britain’s housing market has shown further signs of recovery, with house prices and housebuilding activity rising at their fastest pace for three years in July.Construction activity in the UK surged, largely on the back of more housebuilding, according to a poll of purchasing managers. Meanwhile, figures from Nationwide, the UK’s biggest building society, indicated house prices had risen more in the past 12 months than at any time since August 2010.Nationwide said on Friday that house prices rose 3.9 per cent in the year to July – the highest amount since August 2010. The average house price in the UK is now £170,825.Economists credited government schemes to encourage banks to lend more to would-be homeowners for the revival in activity.“Housing market activity has been gathering momentum gradually over the last few months as an improvement in confidence about the outlook for the economy and a number of government measures to boost housing demand seem to have ignited a modest recovery here,” said Blerina Uruçi, an economist at Barclays Bank.In March. George Osborne, chancellor, unveiled his Help to Buy scheme to help first-time buyers on to the property ladder and spur construction companies to build more homes.Last summer, the Bank of England and the Treasury collaborated on the Funding for Lending Scheme, which offers banks cheap central bank cash if they lend more to the UK’s households and businesses.“Signs of a modest improvement in wider economic conditions and further modest gains in employment are likely to be lifting buyer sentiment,” said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. “An improvement in the availability and a reduction in the cost of credit, partly as a result of policy measures, are also boosting demand.”The purchasing managers’ index for construction, produced by data company Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing Managers, a trade body, rose to 57 in July from 51 the previous month. The PMI reading, the highest since June 2010 and comfortably above the 50 figure that marks an expansion in activity, beat analysts’ expectations.Levels of activity were higher in all areas of the industry, but housebuilders contributed the most to the rise. Tim Moore, economist at Markit, said: “The swing back to output growth broadened to include commercial and civil engineering activity during July, although housing construction remains the one thing crucial to the sector’s strong upturn at present.”
509;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-01T14:44:50Z;Factory data boost UK recovery hopes;;Britain’s manufacturing has shown the most promising sign yet that it is recovering, with purchasing managers signalling that activity grew at its fastest pace in almost two and a half years in July.Though the UK’s recovery has gained in momentum since the spring, much of that lift has come from the dominant services sector. However, the purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, published on Thursday, indicated that Britain’s factories were starting to capitalise on a rise in demand.The manufacturing PMI, produced by data group Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, rose to 54.6 in July, up from 52.9 and comfortably above the 50 level that marks an expansion in activity.The reading, the highest since March 2011, comfortably beat analysts’ expectations, prompting sterling to rise against the euro and the yen.Though the pick-up in factory activity was mainly down to domestic sales, new export business also surged at its fastest pace for two years.New order volumes rose at their fastest pace since February 2011, which suggests that activity will remain strong.The pound continued to appreciate after the Bank of England held monetary policy steady on Thursday, ahead of the publication of a crucial inflation report next week.The rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee kept interest rates at 0.5 per cent and the size of the BoE’s quantitative easing programme of asset purchases at £375bn, as expected.The BoE suggested in the minutes of last month’s policy meeting that it would wait until the release of its inflation report on Wednesday to reveal a framework for forward guidance to markets and the public that the MPC will keep interest rates low until the economy fully recovered.Brian Hilliard, economist at Société Générale, a bank, said: “The improving momentum of the economy will be welcome but will not derail MPC plans for forward guidance.“The die is already cast. Forward guidance will be announced next week.”Additional reporting by Neil Dennis
510;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-01T14:19:59Z;Turkey’s PMI: sinking;;"Turkey’s purchasing managers’ index joined Russia’s in dipping into negative territory on Thursday, in further evidence of sluggishness in the economy and of the fact that, while some countries on the edge of Europe are showing signs of renewed life, others are still stuck in the mud.Turkey’s manufacturing PMI from Markit Economics and HSBC fell to 49.8 in July from 51.2 in June, its first dip below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction since July 2012, even though the companies polled said manufacturing levels were broadly unchanged.But companies also reported slowing aggregate market conditions and declining orders, down for the first time in 11 months.Domestic demand has been hit by falling consumer confidence in the wake of the recent protests in Turkey, while volatile exchange rates and regional instability have hit exports.Burcu Unuvar, senior economist at Istanbul brokerage Is Investment, says the weak consumer confidence is particularly worrying as it comes in spite of interest rates being close to historically low levels.“Rates are low but people are less eager to spend,” she says, pointing to the recent volatility of the lira coupled with low expectations of recovery in Turkey’s core European export markets. And she says private sector investment has been weak because of front-loaded investments made in 2010 and 2011.Worse, Unuvar points out that as much as 2.9 percentage points of the 3 per cent growth Turkey recorded in the first quarter was attributable to public sector spending.“It’s too early [in the election cycle] to attribute that to a pre-election spending but with Turkey’s external deficit, the government has to be careful,” she says.And she says the one positive note in the Markit report – that workforce numbers continue to rise – is no reason for celebration.“It’s not clear why that has happened,” she says. “In part it can be down to public sector investment, but part also can be due to greater pressure on employers to register employees. What is clear is that given the current conditions we can expect employment levels to deteriorate as well.”With youth unemployment already as high as 18 per cent, she says, Turkey desperately needs economic growth.However, given current conditions of weak demand there is no short-term panacea and after recording growth of only 2.2 last year Turkey can look forward to two more years of sub-potential growth. Is Investment predicts growth of 3.3 per cent this year and of 3.5 per cent in 2014.Related reading:

511;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Asia PMIs: turning red;;"A quick look at manufacturing purchasing managers’ indices for Asia this year shows a worrying trend. From a positive start to 2013, the numbers for the six countries tracked by Markit Economics/HSBC are gradually slipping down to the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction, and below.In July, only one country – Vietnam – showed improvement, and it was still well below the 50 mark. India and Indonesia were only a fraction above. China, Taiwan and South Korea have kept falling.Here are some of the highlights:The big one though is China. HSBC’s verdict? Hongbin Qu, chief economist, said:With weak demand from both domestic and external markets, the cooling manufacturing sector continued to weigh on employment. Yet this, plus the recent weaker data, has prompted Beijing to introduce more finetuning measures, from tax breaks for small companies to increased spending on public housing, railway, energy saving and IT infrastructure areas. These targeted measures should boost confidence and reduce downside risks to growth.Here’s the chart:Related reading:

512;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-08-01T07:20:25Z;Russia PMI: into contraction;;"More cause for concern over the Russian economy: its purchasing managers’ index, as produced by Markit Economics and HSBC, fell below 50 in July for the first time since August 2011, as manufacturing output declined and redundancies grew at the fastest rate in six months.In PMI terms, 50 points marks the difference between an expected expansion or contraction in activity. Russia’s manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 in July from 51.7 in June.This from Alexander Morozov, chief economist for Russia at HSBC:Output, new orders and employment – all key PMI indexes – marked significant falls to below the 50 point no-change mark in July. On top of that, inventories recorded an increase for the third month in a row, a trend seen before only during the crisis years of 2008 and 1998. These results appear negatively surprising after quite robust PMI survey results in the preceding month.There was some good news, however:Against such sad backdrop, the improvement of New Export Orders to a 14-month high was the only bright spot in the survey. This is what makes the current situation positively different from those seen in the past, in 2008 and 1998: External demand is favourable for the resumption of growth this time.The government is clearly rattled. Last week it unveiled a stimulus package in a bid to jump-start the economy, a week after figures showed economic growth had slowed to 1.7 per cent in the first half.The outlook remains decidedly mixed with some, though not many, reasons to expect an improvement. Morozov again:First, the chief growth weakness was registered in the intermediary goods sector in July, while both consumer goods and investment goods sectors saw continued demand growth. This could support demand for intermediary goods in the coming weeks. Second, the likely rich harvest this year should give a boost to the food industry, while export demand (if sustained) should translate into stronger domestic demand through local production chains. Finally, inflation easing should support income growth, growth of private consumption and output growth in related industries. That said, other Russian industries still appear vulnerable in the current environment, and the sustainability of export demand is not guaranteed, with signs of further growth moderation in China.Related reading:

513;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Goldman bets on eurozone recovery;;Goldman Sachs Asset Management has significantly increased its exposure to European equities in anticipation of an end to the recession in Europe.The US investment house had been overweight European equities by 4 per cent compared with the MSCI All Country World index for several months, but it recently doubled its overweight position to over 8 per cent.Eddie Perkin, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s international equity business, said the European economy has been “bouncing along the bottom for a number of years now, but there are some positive signs of improvement”.He pointed to recent data from Markit, the UK data provider, that suggested the eurozone edged back into positive growth in July.Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index, considered an indicator of gross domestic product data, rose to 50.4, from 48.7 in June, its highest reading since January 2012. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.Mr Perkin said: “It is reasonable to think the recession in Europe is coming to an end, although when that might happen is up for debate.“If and when the economy emerges from the doldrums, I think there are good opportunities in Europe.”Goldman analysts around the world have observed European companies across sectors, notably energy and pharmaceuticals, trading at a 50 per cent discount to their US equivalents, according to Mr Perkin.Other asset management companies, however, remain reluctant to switch to overweight positions on European equities.Russell Investments only slightly upgraded its exposure to European stocks this month by shifting from underweight to neutral.Investment strategist Wouter Sturkenboom said European equities have “started to become more attractive, given the high valuation of US equities and some mitigation in policy and political risk”.But the US fund house voiced continuing concerns over negative credit growth, high unemployment, the unlikely prospect of political reform and stagnated growth in southern Europe.Vote now on LinkedInDeutsche Asset & Wealth Management, meanwhile, said it might upgrade its outlook for European equities in the second half of the year, but that high refinancing costs for debtors in peripheral Europe were a concern, “representing a heavy burden on medium-sized companies especially”.Although Goldman’s Mr Perkin believes Europe’s economic improvement is durable, he acknowledged that European companies have a “disproportionate share of exposure to emerging markets”, which could affect valuations in the short term.He said: “Listed corporates in Europe get nearly one-third of revenues from emerging market economies, and we have seen some softness in those economies and weakness in consumer demand.“If that were to continue or worsen, European corporates would be exposed to those countries and they could see soft results.”Mr Perkin added, however, that he remained confident about the long-term growth prospects for emerging markets, and their positive impact on European companies.“Once we get past this lull, having exposure to developing economies will actually be a very positive attribute,” he said.

The positive news continued in the US where preliminary manufacturing PMI data came in better than expected, while the uneven nature of global growth was underscored by disappointing data from China.AmericasUSNew home sales in the US rose 8.3 per cent from a month earlier to an annualised pace of 497,000 units, according to the Department of Commerce. The figures topped forecasts for a gain of 1.7 per cent rise.Meanwhile, preliminary Markit PMI figures showed manufacturing expanded in July with the index reaching 53.2 compared with June’s 51.9, once more over the 50.0 level that indicates an expansion in activity. The data set is relatively new and is not as closely watched as indicators out later in the month.AsiaJapanJapan’s trade deficit widened to ¥181bn from ¥56bn the year before. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the trade deficit improved, narrowing to ¥599bn from ¥777bn in May. Seasonally adjusted exports rose 1.1 month-on-month in June to their highest level since February 2011 helped by a weaker yen, while imports slipped 1.7 per cent.AfricaSouth AfricaConsumer prices edged up 0.3 per cent month-on-month in June, pulled up by housing and utilities. It was enough to balance out the 0.3 per cent decline seen in May, but still below expectations.EuropeEurozoneThe PMI composite output index rose for the fourth successive month to reach an 18-month high of 50.4 in July. The manufacturing PMI and manufacturing PMI output indices also ventured into the expansionary zone, hitting 50.1 and 52.3 respectively.The services index remained in contraction below 50. However it still rose to 49.6 from 48.3 and recorded the smallest decline in 18 months.“The revival is being led by a broad-based upturn in manufacturing, where growth surged to a two-year high. Increased goods production was reported in Germany, France and across the rest of the region as a whole,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.He added: “The ECB in particular will be feeling much more confident in its expectation of the region returning to growth by the end of the year.”FranceThe contraction in the PMI composite output index slowed, edging from 47.4 last month to 48.8. The index reached its highest point since February 2012, helped by an increase in manufacturing output, which was at a 25-month high of 51.3.“With key variables such as new business, employment and backlogs of work all showing more modest declines, and service providers reporting a more positive outlook regarding future activity, momentum seems to be heading in the right direction and could herald a return to growth in the second half of the year,” said Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit.GermanyFaster expansion in manufacturing and services drove the PMI composite index up to 52.8 in July from 50.4 in June. Manufacturing output pushed further into expansionary territory, rising from 50.5 to 53.4.Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said: “The stronger performance of the German private sector in July appears to have been driven by improvements in domestic business and consumer spending. In particular, manufacturers cited higher demand patterns from the autos industry and among clients in the domestic construction sector, which helped offset continued weakness in key export markets.”UKThe Confederation of British Industry’s industry survey showed a rebound in the balance of current order books from -18 per cent in June to -12 per cent this month. Firmer domestic demand and mild improvement in the export order book balance helped the net balance reach its highest point since December 2012.“Optimism in the sector has risen again, and demand conditions are expected to improve further in the coming three months,” said Stephen Gifford, CBI’s director of economics. However, he warned that “manufacturers remain concerned about political and economic conditions abroad limiting export orders, which is likely to reflect heightened uncertainty over the global economic outlook.”Czech RepublicThe composite business and consumer confidence index fell slightly to 83.6. An improvement in the current economic situation within construction helped business sentiment remain flat at 84, even though services confidence slipped 2.6 points as consumers worried about their financial standing.

The area, known as the “middle office”, is where swaths of banking risk analysis and control takes place.Marianne Brown, chief executive of Omgeo, said the purchase meant DTCC and Omgeo could pursue a single, global strategy for post-trade processing and settlement as they face key industry issues.Post-trade services like automated trade affirmations and settlement cycles have come under greater scrutiny amid a global regulatory push to tighten up monitoring counterparty risk in financial markets. Concerns have been growing, however, that many institutional investor and broker systems are inadequate to cope with growing demands.Ms Brown, a former NYSE Euronext executive, will continue in her role in the enlarged company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. While financial data for Omgeo is not published, Thomson Reuters has said Omgeo recorded lower revenues in 2012 because of reduced market transaction volumes.The decline came in spite of a 33 per cent increase in the number of clients using Omgeo’s main platform for matching cross-border equity, fixed income and contract-for-difference transactions.The move extends an significant reshape of DTCC’s portfolio of extensive assets this year as it moves into risk analysis services like trade repositories and trade identifiers.It has sold its Corporate Actions Validation Service to Markit, a UK data provider, and has agreed to sell down to a 25 per cent stake in EuroCCP, a lossmaking European equities clearing house. It also sold its stake in MarkitServ, its trade processing joint venture with Markit for which it took a $39.1m impairment charge at the end of last year.The carrying value of DTCC’s investment in Omgeo was $39.1m, around half of Omgeo’s net book value.

Across the Atlantic, Germany and Norway exhibited weak manufacturing sectors, while Hungary’s industrial output had its biggest contraction so far this year. Export numbers from Malaysia disappointed as shipments to the US and Japan decreased.AmericasUSThe US economy added 195,000 jobs last month, up from 175,000 in May, showing the rate of job creation is far quicker than expected. The unemployment rate remains unchanged at 7.6 per cent.EuropeGermanyLack of demand at home and abroad resulted in weak manufacturing data out of Germany. May manufacturing orders were down 1.3 per cent month on month, slower than a 2.2 per cent contraction in April. The biggest decline came from domestic orders, which were down 2 per cent month on month. This follows a weak 48.6 in June’s manufacturing PMI survey. Economists at Markit said: “There’s a lack of demand both at home and in export markets, so stagnation seems to be the best that we can expect for the time being.”Norway: Manufacturing production was worse than expected, falling 2.1 per cent month on month in May after a positive figure of 2.9 per cent in April. This has pulled down the year-on-year rate to 2.8 from 6.1 in April. This follows a disappointing 46.7 manufacturing PMI number in June.Sweden: The country ran a budget deficit of Skr6.4bn in June, after running a Skr22.7bn surplus in May. This is, however, better than expected as the government sold shares in Nordea for Skr19.5bn, lending to the Riksbank was lower and tax income was higher than expected.The consumer price index edged up 0.1 per cent month on month in June, lifting the year-on-year rate to -0.1 per cent, while core inflation – excluding volatile items such as food, beverages, tobacco, energy and fuel – was at -0.2 per cent year on year.HungaryPreliminary numbers showed industrial output had the biggest contraction so far this year, falling 2.1 per cent year on year in May, after a 2.9 per cent improvement in April.

Exports in energy and palm oil products, which comprise more than 60 per cent of total shipments, all declined. Exports declined 3.4 per cent year on year to the US and 12 per cent to Japan. However, these disappointing figures were cushioned by a 7.3 per cent increase in shipments to China, a positive figure given the ongoing worries about the effects of a slower Chinese economy on emerging markets, and a 5.6 per cent increase in shipments to Singapore.Philippines June’s consumer price index rose 2.8 per cent year on year after a 2.7 per cent rise in May. This was pushed up a little by fuel price hikes, but kept in check by a stable increase in food, housing and utilities prices.

The figure, comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, was higher than analysts had expected.The strong figure for services, which make up more than three-quarters of UK economic activity, completes a hat-trick of positive PMI readings this week, with the indices for the manufacturing and construction industries also registering above 50.Together, the readings suggest the economy has grown by at least 0.5 per cent in the three months to June. Services companies also saw the sharpest rise in new business orders since June 2007, suggesting that activity will stay strong in the months ahead.This is all welcome news for Mr Carney, the former Bank of Canada governor, and George Osborne, chancellor, as the former prepares to chair his first meeting of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday.However, while the economy is showing signs of life after years of stagnation, there are concerns that Britain could be seeing the wrong sort of growth.Mr Carney’s predecessor, Sir Mervyn King, often said a return to health would require a shift away from growth driven by consumer demand for services. He believed that a full recovery required a rebalancing of the economy towards manufacturing exports.Mr Osborne’s dreams of an economy “held aloft by the march of the makers” remain a fantasy, however, despite the pound losing about a quarter of its value since the start of the crisis, making exports cheaper.Though activity in Britain’s factories last month outpaced gains seen anywhere else in the world – the PMI reading rising to a two-year high of 52.5 – growth lagged behind the services sector.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said more demand from domestic consumers was a “key driving force” in the recent pick-up. “[The rise in consumer confidence] has been driven in part by initiatives in the housing market,” said Mr Williamson.Senior BoE officials, along with economists at the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s fiscal watchdog, and the International Monetary Fund, have warned that one such initiative – the Help to Buy scheme, set up this year – risked stoking a property bubble while doing little to address a shortage in supply of homes.Separately, a BoE poll published on Wednesday indicated that households would find it easier to borrow in the coming months.Banks surveyed for the quarterly credit conditions report said they had approved more loan applications by households in the second quarter of 2013 than in the first. They forecast this trend would continue in the third quarter.The banks polled said they expected the amount of unsecured lending to households to climb “significantly” in months ahead as credit scoring criteria were loosened further. The poll, coupled with the PMI results, lessens the chances that the BoE’s rate-setters will back more quantitative easing at Thursday’s policy vote.
518;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-07-02T17:33:16Z;Trading places;EU is right to look into credit default swaps market;Since the beginning of the eurozone crisis, credit default swaps have not exactly been popular with European legislators. CDSs are financial instruments used to hedge against possible losses on a default. Yet the idea that some investors may benefit from a sovereign bankruptcy has proved toxic, leading to a political backlash against their use.It would therefore be easy to dismiss this week’s decision by the European Commission to charge 13 banks with infringements of competition policy in the CDS market as tit-for-tat. But this would be the wrong conclusion. The accusations that lenders conspired to block exchanges from competing to protect their business model raise issues that deserve robust scrutiny. It is now up to the banks to prove that Brussels is wrong.The allegations refer to the period between 2006 and 2009, when exchanges such as Deutsche Borse and CME Group sought access to indices and other pricing information that are essential for credit trading on exchanges to emerge. Yet Markit, a data company, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade body (both of which the commission has also charged) allegedly made it impossible for the exchanges to obtain these licences. Banks part-own Markit and play a leading role in ISDA. The EU is right to investigate whether this conflict of interest led to anti-competitive practices.The broader point is that exchanges ought to be allowed to compete fairly in credit derivatives trading. More competition may lead to a reduction in the price of credit insurance, which would surely benefit investors. There is also a case in terms of financial stability. Exchange trading is typically better than over-the-counter transactions in dealing with counterparty risk. A clearing house stands between the two parties, ensuring that a default does not have knock-on effects on other institutions.Banks claim that CDS markets are often too illiquid to be moved to exchanges. But the notional outstanding value of all contracts was, at the end of last year, $25tn – a large enough sum for regulators to take a closer look. At the very least, the authorities should make OTC deals safer by increasing margin requirements.CDSs are useful hedging instruments. As such, they should not be banned. But policy makers have a duty to punish abuses and to make financial markets safe. Since these are the commission’s objectives, its action this week deserves support.
519;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Europe steps up regulatory assault on CDS;Brussels alleges collusion potentially made system more vulnerable to shocks;"Investment banks’ lucrative role as the middlemen of derivatives markets have long been under regulatory attack. But Brussels is not only rewriting rules for future trading and clearing; it could now punish banks for their past dominance.On Monday the European Commission accused 13 of the world’s top investment banks of illegally sustaining their grip over the credit default swap market by muscling out rival exchanges which threatened their indispensable and highly profitable position as dealers.The almost 400-page charge sheet is the latest front in a transatlantic regulatory assault against “over-the-counter” derivatives markets such as CDS, where banks build customised insurance-like products for clients, doing deals privately away from exchanges and generating big revenue streams.The allegations from 2006-2009 are not yet proven. But Brussels alleges that collusion did more than simply inflate costs or reduce choice for investors in CDS. It also potentially left the world’s financial system more vulnerable to shocks and amplified the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Exchange-trading of credit derivatives improves transparency and market stability,” says Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief. “But the banks acted collectively to prevent this from happening. They delayed the emergence of exchange trading of these financial products because they feared that it would reduce their revenues.”All 15 groups receiving the “statement of objections” on Monday have a right of defence before Mr Almunia takes a decision and potentially imposes hefty penalties. Their case will rest on picking apart the evidence of illegal co-operation, while showing there were many other reasons preventing the rise of credit trading on exchanges. At stake are hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines.Underlying the commission’s case is an assumption that without interference CDS trading would naturally progress – as contracts became more standard and volumes increased – from the opaque, bespoke world of dealers to cheaper, more open exchanges, where trades are cleared.This trend would also benefit market stability as counterparty risk is more strictly managed through clearing houses, the commission argues. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring a deal is completed in the event of a default.Regulators have moved to force this transition on to exchanges through law on both sides of the Atlantic. But for now CDS remain the purview of banks. The first credit futures traded on exchange were launched just a fortnight ago – via IntercontinentalExchange – while clearing of OTC trades remains the exception. Around $2.5tn of transactions had been cleared by December 2012, compared to the notional outstanding for the CDS market of $25tn.The Commission’s two-year probe homed in on two ways that investment banks are alleged to have joined forces to safeguard this profitable business.The first is what Mr Almunia describes as “control” of Markit, the main information provider for the CDS market, and Isda, the trade body that issues licences that would be essential for trading credit on exchanges to emerge.Both bodies – on the advice of banks sitting on their internal committees – included explicit restrictions in licences that made it impossible for Deutsche Börse and CME Group to enter the credit trading business, according to the commission’s preliminary conclusions.Investigators found that all 13 banks at some point were involved in or aware of these crucial recommendations. Some of those restrictions remained in place until recently, but the commission case has been narrowed to a three-year period up to 2009, where its evidence is strongest.The antitrust division of the US Department of Justice has been probing the CDS market since the crisis, focusing on the role of Markit and its ownership by big investment banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse.*According to Brussels, a smaller group of investment banks also allegedly sought to preserve their role through a second means: co-ordinating their choice of clearing house.As banks began to clear some off-exchange CDS trades from 2009, US derivatives exchange ICE quickly built up a dominant position. This was in spite of an earlier concerted effort to break into credit trading by CME, the world’s largest futures market operator.Rather than just offer CDS clearing like ICE, CME launched hybrid credit futures trading in 2006, which in theory challenged the banks’ OTC business. The Chicago group’s efforts failed to make headway, in part because the banks favoured the approach taken by its rival.*This article has been amended to remove a sentence stating that Tradeweb and the Clearing Corp were part of the DoJ’s investigation."
520;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-07-01T11:31:39Z;Banks charged with blocking CDS market;;Investment banks’ 20-year grip over credit insurance markets has come under regulatory assault as Brussels served charges against 13 banks for allegedly conspiring to block exchanges from challenging their business model.The formal European Commission charge-sheet, running to almost 400 pages, alleges collusion to ensure the insurance-like contracts remained an “over-the-counter” (OTC) product – preserving the banks’ lucrative role as middlemen.Investigators claim the banks from 2006-2009 protected their indispensable position in the $25tn global market through “control” of a trade body and information provider, which vetted whether new exchanges should be licensed.Credit Default Swaps provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to manage risk and bet on creditworthiness. During the eurozone crisis some European politicians railed against the contracts as symbols of reckless speculation.If the commission acts on the charges, the 13 banks, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda), a derivatives trade body, and Markit, the main data handler for CDS, could face fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover.Brussels alleges that the harm from blocking exchanges, such as Deutsche Börse and CME Group of the US, went beyond trapping investors in the relatively more costly OTC market.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, said keeping CDS in the opaque OTC market weakened the financial system, increasing counterparty risks that were brutally exposed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Over-the-counter trading is not only more expensive for investors than exchange trading, it is also prone to systemic risks,” he said.New global rules coming into effect will require most swaps deals to be processed through clearing houses, which stand between trading parties and guarantee deals. Many OTC swaps, such as interest rate swaps, have already made the switch but the CDS market has been relatively untouched.According to Isda only about 10 per cent of a market with an average outstanding notional value of $25tn was cleared last year. Many trades in Europe are cleared via IntercontinentalExchange, a US exchanges operator. Mr Almunia said several banks “also sought to shut out exchanges in other ways, for example by coordinating the choice of their preferred clearing house”.US antitrust authorities are also investigating the CDS market and the relationship between Markit and the banks that part-own it. Banks and data providers are already facing private suits in the wake of the regulatory scrutiny. A pension fund for Ohio-based sheet metal workers argued that banks’ “collective dominance” inflated CDS prices by about 17 to 34 times compared to more transparent exchanges.The EU statement of objections is addressed to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bear Stearns, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Markit and Isda.The banks involved and Markit declined to comment. ISDA said it was confident it had acted properly at all times and had not infringed EU competition rules.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway in New York
521;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-07-01T10:13:45Z;Manufacturing report fuels UK recovery hopes;;Positive data on British manufacturing activity and the health of the mortgage market helped bolster hopes that the UK recovery is gaining momentum.Activity in the UK’s manufacturing sector soared by the greatest amount in two years in June, according to a closely watched poll published on Monday.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, rose to 52.5 last month, from 51.5 in May. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity.It is the third month in a row that manufacturing activity, which makes up just over 10 per cent of the economy, has expanded. The reading is the highest since May 2011.The figures for new orders rose for the fourth month in a row to the highest level since February 2011, signalling activity will remain buoyant further into the summer. The strongest rates of growth were in the textiles and clothing, and food and drinks industries.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “A brightening domestic market and resilient overseas demand led to a broad-based expansion across the sector.”David Noble, CIPS chief, said hardly any pick-up in employment was the “one disappointing spot”, although he believed the jobs market could improve in the coming months.“The swell in order books and increased levels of purchasing activity signal that the subdued labour market trend may be shortlived,” Mr Noble said.Separately, lending data from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases surged to 58,242 in May, up from 54,354 the previous month, comfortably beating analysts’ expectations.However, the figures also showed a fall in business lending by £1.5bn, against an average of £900m per month over the previous six months.
522;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-07-01T07:40:12Z;China: investors take weak growth in their stride but rightly fret about property;;"One effect of the recent turmoil in China’s financial markets is that investors are no longer surprised by gloomy news on the economic outlook.Chinese equities barely flinched after the announcement of the official purchasing managers’ index for June and the final version of HSBC’s PMI for the same period. Even though both pointed stagnating growth in China’s factories, the often-volatile Chinese stock market was almost unmoved, with the Shanghai Composite index closing 0.8 per cent up.The official PMI slipped to a four-month low of 50.1 in June, fractionally above the 50-point level that indicates growth. A separate PMI survey by HSBC and Markit, which focuses on export-oriented non-state companies, showed industrial activity sliding to 48.2, its lowest for nine months.HSBC PMI numbers across Asia painted a fairly grey picture with export demand often the weak link. In Taiwan, a barometer for global electronics, the index remained below the 50-point level indicating growth. In South Korea, the HSBC Korea PMI recorded its first sub-50 reading in five months as new orders fell.As Andy Ji of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia investors were probably braced for worse news, given the credit crunch imposed by the central bank:The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 50.1 in June, just a tad above the critical 50 level and its weakest in four months. However, the immediate price action following the data release on the currency market suggests that market participants had been preparing for a worse outcome especially following the tumults more recently in China’s financial system.But it may just be a matter of time. In China, the transmission links between the country’s core financial institutions and the outer reaches of manufacturing industry aren’t as quick as in developed economies, or even smaller developing countries.Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the statistics agency, quoted by Reuters, said after Monday’s data that the country’s factory growth is likely to founder further and that factories, preparing for glum times, have cut jobs for 13 consecutive months.The auhorities are ready for a slowdown. As Barclays said in a note:Over the weekend, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at a party meeting, stressing “we should no longer evaluate the performance of leaders simply by GDP growth. Instead, we should look at welfare improvement, social development and environmental indicators to evaluate leaders”. This is yet another sign the new leaders are more concerned about the quality of growth, rather than quantity – which supports our long-held view of their tolerance of slower growth in the near term.But how slow and for how long? There are signs that with GDP growth slowing below last year’s 7.8 per cent, Beijing would accept anything above 7 per cent for 2013. But the critical issue isn’t at the GDP level, but in the property market.The authorities want to slow house price increases, which have picked up recently, but are well aware that the market is highly-leveraged. Squeeze the lenders too hard and prices could plunge destabilising the property industry and, potentially, the banks. Squeeze too little and property investors will shrug off the policy makers, as they have done before.The problem is that the effects of a real squeeze in property aren’t predictable and carry the risk of an investor panic. So while the range of possible outcomes for 2013 GDP growth is almost quite narrow – say, between 7.6 per cent and 7.0 per cent – the range of possible outcomes for the property market is very wide. Certainly, the danger of banks going bust and needing rescue cannot be excluded. Even if these are small lenders, the tremors could reach far and wide.Frederic Neumann of HSBC wrote in a note on Monday:Even if growth stabilizes at its current pace, tighter financial conditions are bound to weigh on asset values. Of course, property prices also
depend on confidence. This in turn will be affected by economic reforms, which, if determined and convincing enough, could help raise expectations for future growth and thus lend some support to real estate markets. Still, the risks for the property market have grown substantially.What’s important is not the impact of last month’s credit crunch per se, but of the signals it send for the coming months.Related reading

524;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-06-18T09:22:20Z;Soaring air fares push UK inflation to 2.7%;;UK inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in the year to May, up from 2.4 per cent in April, as air fares soared, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.The rise, slightly higher than analysts expected and the first since February, was caused largely by higher transport costs. Air fares, which rose by more than a fifth over the course of the month, alone added 0.13 percentage points to the figure.Though petrol and diesel prices declined, the fall was far less dramatic than that seen at this time of year in 2012. Overall, transport costs rose 0.4 per cent between April and May, compared with a fall of 0.8 per cent in the same period last year, contributing 0.2 percentage points of the 0.3 percentage point rise.Most of the rest of the upward pressure on prices came from more expensive clothing. A lack of food price inflation helped keep price pressures contained.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the inflation figure acted as a reminder that rising prices would continue to act as a brake on economic recovery.“Importantly, inflation continues to run well above pay growth, which was just 0.9 per cent a year in the three months to April, up only marginally on the 0.8 per cent record low seen in March,” Mr Williamson said. “Back last September, real incomes had been falling at a rate of just 0.3 per cent. That rate of decline has now accelerated to 1.8 per cent.”

526;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Regional confidence lifts hopes for recovery;;Business activity grew in nearly all UK regions last month, and at its fastest pace since March 2012, in the latest survey to show that the quickening economic recovery appears to be widely spread.Yorkshire had the fastest growth, followed by Wales, London and northwest England, according to the Lloyds TSB regional purchasing managers’ index. Only Northern Ireland showed a contraction.Anecdotal evidence from companies suggested that stronger underlying demand from clients and improving domestic economic conditions supported business activity. Higher levels of new work were also reported in all regions.The headline index measuring overall business activity rose to 54.8, up from 52.2 in April. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity, according to data company Markit, which compiles the survey.Northeast England returned to growth but remained the weakest performer among English regions, followed by the east of England. There was growth in every English region.David Oldfield, managing director for SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Banking Group, said: “The strong growth in order books also offers hope that the recent upturn in activity should gain momentum over the coming months. This in turn should start to give local firms the confidence they need to step up the pace of job creation and further boost the economy.”The buoyant picture was underlined by the latest survey of 400 job agencies by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and KPMG, which found that permanent appointments rose to a six-month high in May, while temporary hirings also rose following a dip in April.The Midlands, northern and southern England saw permanent placements grow, while London saw a small decline. Public sector permanent vacancies fell, while those in the private sector rose at their fastest for at least 17 months.The survey will raise hopes that the recent falls in employment seen in official data may come to an end as the economy picks up. Economists expect unemployment to remain steady at 7.8 per cent of the workforce in monthly data to be published on Wednesday, but at the cost of a tighter squeeze on pay, according to a Reuters poll.Bernard Brown, KPMG partner, said: “The latest figures certainly give the strongest indication for some time that the jobs market is on an upward trajectory. However the pay-off seems to be a slowdown in salary growth as new starters’ pay has slowed to its lowest level since the turn of the year.”Kevin Green, REC chief executive, said the only cloud was that the skills mismatch was becoming more pronounced. “Employers are struggling to find the skilled candidates they need in sales, marketing and business development to prepare for the upturn in the economy, while the majority of the unemployed do not have the skills for the jobs that are available.”Prospects for manufacturers have improved over the past three months, with companies reporting the strongest output and orders balances for a year, according to the latest quarterly outlook survey published by EEF, the manufacturers’ association, and business advisers BDO.Lee Hopley, EEF chief economist, said: “Positive manufacturing data has been somewhat easier to find in recent months and our latest survey provides further confidence that the sector’s prospects are improving.”She added that while demand in European markets remained weak, and some individual sectors were facing challenges, the improvement in output and positive expectations on orders augured well for growth in the second half of the year.However, she said a relative weakness in export orders and a softening in investment intentions suggested confidence may still need to be tempered.But prospects in the City of London remain subdued. New job opportunities in London’s financial services sector rose by 20 per cent in May compared with April, but were 59 per cent below a year ago, according to Morgan McKinley, a recruitment firm.Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, said: “Although the market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic issues, sentiment has slowly been improving since the start of the year.”Astbury Marsden, another City recruiter, put the year-on-year decline at 45 per cent. It said current volumes of work were subdued but there were some grounds for optimism.
527;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-06-05T16:57:43Z;UK services sector data boost hopes over recovery;;Britain’s economic recovery is gaining strength and speed according to data that suggest the dominant services sector grew last month at the fastest rate in more than a year.The unexpectedly strong purchasing managers’ index for the services industry, an unofficial monthly survey of companies in the UK economy’s biggest sector, is the latest sign that the economy is stirring after years of stagnation. Economists said it was also one of the most significant.“I almost got excited by today’s services PMI – that doesn’t happen often,” said Jens Larsen, an economist at RBC Capital Markets and former Bank of England official. He said extraordinarily easy credit, stabilisation in the eurozone and declining inflation were among the reasons the economy was starting to improve. “And most importantly, expectations that the worst is behind us, even if the present is not all that nice.”The PMI index soared to 54.9, up from 52.9 in April, bringing it back into line with its long-term average. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity, according to data company Markit, which compiles the survey.While the PMI surveys have not always correctly signalled subsequent improvements in official data, economists were encouraged by news of the sharpest rise in new business for more than three years.The volume of demand from new orders was so great that the PMI registered the first back-to-back increase in the level of work outstanding since September 2007.The PMI for the services industry, which accounts for more than three-quarters of economic output, follows strong PMI readings for the manufacturing and construction sectors this week.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the economy had “moved up a gear”. On his calculations, the surveys were consistent with quarterly real growth of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year. The economy grew 0.3 per cent in the first quarter, a faster than expected rate.“For the first time in a year, manufacturing, services and construction sectors are all now reporting higher levels of activity,” Mr Williamson said.Malcolm Barr of JPMorgan was one of several economists to say the Bank of England was now less likely to inject more stimulus into the economy in the form of quantitative easing when new governor Mark Carney arrives next month.“Our forecast for £25bn more QE alongside modest moves toward rate guidance in August was predicated on activity data which did not suggest much ongoing acceleration in activity while inflation concerns were assuaged,” he said. “The move up in the PMI surveys is enough for us to change that call.” He said he still expected the BoE to introduce some sort of guidance on the future path of interest rates, though.Economic optimism has grown significantly in the months since the government announced Mr Carney’s appointment and urged him to use “monetary activism” to help the UK reach “escape velocity”.“With inflation descending back to target and economic growth reviving, Mark Carney’s appointment as BoE governor is looking less like the biggest ‘hospital pass’ in central banking and more like a remarkable piece of timing/good fortune,” said Ross Walker, an economist at RBS.
528;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-21T20:12:12Z;Temasek stake in Markit values data company at $5bn;;Singapore’s wealth fund Temasek has taken a stake of around 10 per cent in Markit in a deal that values the fast-growing UK financial data company at around $5bn.The $500m investment will allow the London-based group, which was founded just over a decade ago, to expand beyond Europe and US markets to emerging markets in Asia.Initially creating a franchise in providing data on prices and valuations of privately-traded credit derivatives, Markit has rapidly expanded through acquisition to a financial data empire that has made inroads into a market dominated by Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.In the last significant change of share ownership more than three years ago, private equity group General Atlantic Partners invested $250m for a 7.5 per cent stake, a deal that valued Markit at about $3bn.Temasek will take a seat on the board at Markit, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The stake came from share sales by employees and some of Markit’s bank shareholders, the person said.Temasek’s shareholding is expected to be a larger investment than any of the banks that continue to own a stake. Markit is owned by a group of banks, asset managers, brokers and its management.Lance Uggla, chief executive and co-founder of Markit, described Temasek’s investment as “a significant milestone” in the company’s 10-year history. “The strength of their position and profile in Asia, an area where we see significant potential and opportunity, will help fuel our growth in the region,” he said.Mr Uggla is eyeing opportunities to sell Markit’s products like data valuation and back-office operations like trade processing to the region as it gears up to meet tough global legislation designed to safeguard markets against systemic risk.A mandate from G20 countries requires greater processing of so-called over-the-counter trades through clearing houses.Reforms such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US, and future equivalent legislation in Europe and Asia, are expected to force banks, asset managers and hedge funds to spend money on tracking risks to their capital more accurately.Markit has a growing association with Singapore, where it opened an office in 2005. Last year it launched a bond pricing service for the Singapore dollar bond market.Markit’s data were instrumental in spurring the development of the market for credit default swaps – tradeable financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the likelihood of debt default or hedge against such risk. The gross amount of CDS outstanding is now $27tn, many of which are based and daily valued on prices supplied by Markit.However, antitrust officials in Brussels are investigating whether Markit played a role in helping some investment banks shut exchanges out of establishing rival credit derivatives trading platforms.
529;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-16T04:48:08Z;China’s companies spurn directive to pay 30% dividend;;Just 60 per cent of China’s biggest listed-companies met the dividend guidelines laid out by the Shanghai Stock Exchange earlier this year, a blow for attempts to build credibility in China’s equity markets.Of the members of the FTSE A50 index, only 30 companies paid a dividend of over 30 per cent during the most recent earnings season, according to data compiled by Markit.In January, the Shanghai bourse told listed companies to return at least 30 per cent of profits to shareholders “because of a definite gap between cash dividend ratios for Shanghai-listed companies and those in mature markets”.Those that met the requirements would be given preferential treatment when seeking approval for financing or takeover activity, while those that fell short would need to provide a full explanation in their annual reports.The exchange’s edict was part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to boost credibility and encourage more long-term investment in the country’s struggling equity markets.Chinese stocks have been in the dumps for more than three years. Last November the Shanghai index fell below 2,000 points for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis. Although it then went on a brief, stellar run – gaining more than 30 per cent in just a few weeks – the rally ran aground in February. Year to date, the market is in negative territory.The lack of belief in equities among local investors also has had broad economic ramifications. Many instead have turned to the property market, fuelling a rapid rise in house prices, or to high-yielding wealth management products (WMPs), offered through the shadow banking system.According to the data from Markit, the companies that failed to meet the exchange’s dividend guidelines were mainly medium-sized lenders – the most exposed to WMPs – and construction and materials groups.However, the new rules did have some success. The 30 companies meeting the threshold this year compares with just 22 last year. China Merchants Bank and Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery were among those to raise their payouts to meet the new guidelines.Some analysts have questioned the logic of the guidelines altogether, noting that certain sectors were more in need of cash than others.“Compared to state-owned banks, these smaller banks need to reserve a larger portion of their earnings as supplementary capital in order to support future profitability and sustainable growth,” Markit analysts wrote in their report.
530;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-13T05:23:27Z;UK manufacturing sector regains footing;;Further evidence that the UK’s stuttering manufacturing sector is regaining its footing has emerged, after an industry survey found that global industrial companies are increasingly favouring Britain as a place to source high-tech components and seek future profits.A poll conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit has ranked the UK above better-known manufacturing powerhouses of Germany and Japan, as well as above emerging economies such as India and Brazil, as a destination for future profit growth.The survey of 335 senior manufacturing executives around the world placed the UK third, behind the US and China, as the country where global companies expect to derive the majority of their profit growth over the next two years.Global manufacturers also said that some three-quarters of the manufacturing items sourced from the UK would involve high-tech products that contain significant intellectual property value, rather than simpler and lower-margin commodity items.“Despite challenging conditions faced by UK manufacturers, it is encouraging that global markets are increasing focusing on the UK for growth in sales, profit and sourcing,” said Stephen Cooper, KPMG’s head of manufacturing.“In addition, over the past few years, the weak pound has made UK goods relatively cheaper in the global marketplace.”The findings of the annual KPMG global manufacturing survey is the third recent such piece of more positive news for the UK manufacturing sector.Although the CBI employers’ group last week found that small and medium-sized UK manufacturers saw their orders and output shrink in the three months to April – the fourth consecutive quarter of decline – sentiment among SMEs for later in the year was more upbeat.Sterling’s weakening had boosted the competitiveness of the UK’s smaller manufacturing companies, and is expected to lead to a pick-up in export orders over the next three months, according to the CBI’s SME Trends survey of 348 companies.“It’s been another disappointing quarter for small and medium-sized manufacturing firms, who have seen new orders and output continue to fall. Nonetheless, firms do expect to raise output a little in the coming three months,” said Stephen Gifford, CBI director of economics.Meanwhile, numbers from the Office for National Statistics from Friday showed that the UK’s trade deficit, which measures the difference between imports and exports, narrowed from £3.4bn in February to £3.1bn in March.The closing of Britain’s trade deficit was linked to stronger exports to non-EU countries, offsetting a widening shortfall for manufactured goods traded with EU countries.
531;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-03T09:20:03Z;UK services index gives cause for optimism with eight-month high;;Growth in activity in the UK’s dominant services sector improved in April, rising to an eight-month high because of better weather and stronger overseas demand.The purchasing managers’ index, compiled by data firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, a trade body, beat analysts’ expectations and rose to 52.9 last month, up from 52.4 in March.It is the fourth month in a row that the services PMI has been above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.The result indicates that conditions could improve further, with the forward-looking new business component rising to its highest level for 11 months. The better conditions were because of new products, better weather and more demand from overseas, purchasing managers said.The better than expected PMI for UK manufacturing, released this weak, also cited rising foreign demand, suggesting that sterling’s depreciation since the turn of the year is helping exporters.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the April PMIs greatly reduced the likelihood of the Bank of England announcing further quantitative easing next Thursday.“The upturn is being led by the services sector, but it has been accompanied by signs of activity stabilising in manufacturing and construction in April,” Mr Williamson said.“The data suggest that the return to growth enjoyed by the economy in the first quarter persisted and may have gained momentum at the start of the second quarter.”The UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter. The services sector accounts for more than three quarters of GDP.
532;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-02T16:13:20Z;Temasek to take $500m stake in Markit;;Temasek, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, is poised to take a stake worth around $500m in Markit, the UK data provider that has become an influential force in financial markets in recent years.The fund is in advanced talks to acquire the stake, two people familiar with the matter said, as the London-based company examines its options for growth in coming years. The percentage of Markit’s equity Temasek will acquire has not been disclosed.Markit has expanded rapidly since it was founded in 2001, building a dominant franchise in providing data on prices and valuations of privately-traded credit derivatives. It has since expanded into a sprawling empire encompassing data valuation, back-office operations and financial services. Private trading in Markit shares last year valued the company at $4.5bn.Its data was instrumental in spurring the development of the market for credit default swaps – tradeable financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the likelihood of debt default or hedge against such risk. The gross amount of CDS outstanding is now $27tn, many of which are based and daily valued on prices supplied by Markit.Markit is eyeing opportunities created by reforms such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US, which requires greater processing of so-called over-the-counter trades through clearing houses and are forcing banks, asset managers and hedge funds to spend money on tracking risk.It offers valuation for banks to assess whether they meet Basel capital requirements and sells technology that connects banks and asset managers to clearing houses that process OTC derivatives.In recent days Markit has been examining its strategic options, including a potential initial public offering, and last week it ran a beauty parade for investment banks.“Every year we look carefully at all options available to the company,” Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, told the Financial Times. However, he added: “We have not made any decision to pursue a public listing.”Markit is owned by a group of banks, asset managers, brokers and its management, although no one party owns more than 15 per cent of the stock. However in January 2010, General Atlantic Partners invested $250m for a 7.5 per cent stake, valuing the group at about $3bn.The stake that Temasek is expected to take will reduce the banks’ stake to a minority shareholding, one person familiar with the matter said.That will help Markit “broaden its governance and reduce conflicts” at a time when it is looking to expand.Temasek declined to comment.Markit has a growing association with Singapore, where it opened an office in 2005. Last year it launched a bond pricing service for the Singapore dollar bond market.Antitrust officials in Brussels are investigating whether the Markit played a role in helping some investment banks shut rivals out of establishing credit derivatives trading platforms.
533;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-02T10:19:41Z;CEE PMIs: Czech bad, Poland awful;;"Terrible news out of Poland on Thursday morning as Polish manufacturing showed signs of a steepening downturn, posting the worst results since the depths of the first wave of the economic crisis in 2009.April’s purchasing managers index, compiled by Markit Economics for HSBC, hit 46.9, far below analysts’ expectations of 47.8 and the worst since July 2009. PMI figures of less than 50 denote a contraction of manufacturing, and Poland has been posting them for 13 successive months, the grimmest performance in a decade.The Czech Republic also posted its 13th straight month of below-50 PMIs, although in the Czech case the April figure was 49.5, up slightly from 49.1 in March.Agata Urbanska, who covers the CEE for HSBC, wrote of the Polish result:The April manufacturing PMI index delivers a significant disappointment. … The deterioration was driven by falling output and new orders indices. New export orders remained weak though improved in April compared to March. But with German PMI correcting lower in March and April there is a downside risks building up for export orders. … The Monetary Policy Council might be forced to consider reopening of the easing cycle even earlier than it implied i.e. ahead of the new inflation report due in July.The Polish central bank has cut its headline rate to 3.25 per cent, and the expectation had been that it would wait until those cuts have been digested before deciding whether to continue the easing cycle. Thursday’s data, coupled with declining inflation – new data out of the central bank has inflation expectations over the next 12 months at only 1.1 per cent – could mean a quicker return to rate cuts.In her comment on the Czech Republic, Urbanska called the Czech outcome:a positive result in comparison to falling PMIs in Germany and neighbouring Poland … In April business conditions continued to deteriorate in the manufacturing sector in the Czech Republic but on the positive note the pace of this deterioration slowed; so far weathering well the increasing pace of deterioration in the manufacturing in Germany in the last couple of months.Related reading:

534;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Purchasing managers report slight improvement in UK construction;;The decline in activity in the UK’s beleaguered construction industry showed signs of slowing last month, with a poll of purchasing managers indicating conditions are not as bad as they have been.The construction purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit, a data company, and trade body the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, registered 49.4, up from 47.2 in March and just below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion.The figure beat the expectations of analysts, who had bet on a reading of 48 and was the best since October 2012. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the improved reading “reflected an element of catch-up after some severe weather delays earlier this year”.Activity in the construction industry, hit hard by the financial crisis, has waned for six months in a row. New business volumes fell for the 11th month in a row, signalling conditions will remain tough for construction workers.Commercial construction activity dropped for the third straight month and the number of civil engineering projects fell markedly, though at a slower pace than in March. A pick-up in residential construction provided some comfort.
535;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-02T07:56:01Z;Asia PMI scorecard: 3 up, 3 down;;"First the good news: all six of the Asian purchasing managers’ indices from HSBC/Markit are in positive territory (that is, a score above 50, which separates expansion from contraction).Now the bad news: three of the six are heading the wrong way.The three on the up are South Korea (52.6 in April from 52.0 in March), Vietnam (51.0 from 50.8) and Indonesia (51.7 from 51.3). Heading down are China (50.4 from 51.6), India (51.0 from 52.0) and Taiwan (50.7 from 51.2).The difference? Mainly domestic demand. As beyondbrics reported on Wednesday, that is what’s keeping Indonesian manufacturers happy. In Vietnam too – as Trinh Nguyen, Asia Economist at HSBC said:The expansion of manufacturing activity reflects a gradual improvement of domestic demand. The manufacturing sector continues to see growth, as indicative by the rise in employment and output.For Korea, the story is similar: the global economy can’t be relied upon but demand from home is keeping things ticking along. HSBC’s Ronald Man commented: “With a fiscal stimulus in the pipeline set to keep domestic demand firm, we believe Korea remains on track to post a meaningful recovery in 2013.”The Chinese government’s own PMI released on Wednesday slowed to 50.6 from 50.9 and was mirrored by HSBC’s figure, which is down to 50.4 – quite a fall from 51.6 in March. Although the PMI has been above the 50-mark for six months, the view of HSBC’s China economist Hongbin Qu was quite gloomy:The slower growth of manufacturing activities in April confirmed a fragile growth recovery of the Chinese economy as external demand deteriorated and renewed destocking pressures built up. The looming deflationary pressures also suggest softer overall demand conditions.In India, it was a case of momentum lost: there was a “deceleration in domestic orders and continued power outages. Export orders, on the other hand, picked up,” according to HSBC.Lastly, although Taiwan’s PMI score dropped in April, HSBC noted that demand from its home market and from the US and Europe helped it weather a lull in mainland China. That’s something you don’t hear too often these days: European demand picking up the slack from China.Related reading:

536;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-01T23:11:04Z;Orders for UK exports rise to highest level in 18 months;;Tentative signs of a pick-up in manufacturing exports emerged on Wednesday after a poll of purchasing managers showed new orders from overseas at their highest level in 18 months.The UK’s policy makers have pinned their hopes on a rebalancing of the economy towards a greater reliance on manufacturing exports to spur a recovery. Much to the disappointment of George Osborne, chancellor, and Sir Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, a “ march of the makers” has eluded Britain, as has meaningful economic growth, despite the pound losing a fifth of its value since the start of the crisis.The National Institute of Economic Research, a think-tank, will say on Thursday that export volumes will fall 1 per cent during 2013, after last year’s decline of 0.2 per cent, largely because of declines in services sold overseas.However, some hope of a rise in manufacturing exports was offered on Wednesday after the purchasing managers’ index rose to a four-month high of 49.8 in April, up from 48.6 in March and just below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion.The jump in the reading for new export orders, from 48.9 to 52.6, was the biggest since July 2011. Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit, which compiles the data with the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, a trade body, said the solid improvement in orders from overseas was “the real surprise”.Despite the PMI data, the picture of the economy is far from conclusive. However, a rise in new export orders from outside the eurozone will encourage Mr Osborne and Sir Mervyn, who have often blamed the crisis in the bloc, which is Britain’s largest export partner, for the failure to rebalance.The PMI data showed purchasing managers reported a rise in interest in UK goods from North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Australia. But, despite relatively high growth in some of those regions, export trade could continue to shrink until the eurozone economy recovers.The International Monetary Fund expects the eurozone economy to shrink 0.3 per cent this year. Although Niesr expects the UK to export more to non-EU countries in the coming years, trade would continue to shrink until growth in the currency bloc resumed.“We do expect export growth to pick up significantly as growth resumes in the euro area. Export growth is forecast to contribute more than 1 percentage point to GDP [gross domestic product] growth, on average, over the period 2014 to 2017,” the think-tank said.Separately, Niesr forecast on Thursday that the UK economy would grow 0.9 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent in 2014.The think-tank warned that, despite the avoidance of a triple-dip recession, the economy remained weak.“Much of the attention focused on the avoidance of a ‘triple-dip’, rather than another quarter of relatively weak economic growth . . . As we have noted many times before, obsessing about a couple of quarters of minute falls in output distracts us from the clear trend: that of a stagnating economy,” Niesr said.
537;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-01T17:59:05Z;Data cloud outlook for global economy;;Further signs of a slowdown in manufacturing activity and trade clouded the outlook for the global economy on Wednesday after a series of closely watched polls pointed to weakening demand.Disappointing data added to concerns that growth in the second quarter will disappoint, though analysts continue to expect conditions to improve in the latter half of 2013.Julian Callow, economist at Barclays, said: “The US and Europe are going through a period of major fiscal adjustment which will continue to weigh on global growth. But I would still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of the year.”Growth in Chinese manufacturing activity, watched for signs about the health of the Chinese and global economies, slowed in April, following unexpectedly weak first-quarter economic growth. China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 50.6 last month from 50.9 in March, though it remained above the crucial reading of 50 that indicates an expansion of activity.The disappointing reading, led by a drop in new export orders, prompted some analysts to speculate whether it would encourage the government to introduce more policies to boost growth. But others argued that a flood of credit in the economy in the first quarter of 2013 had not helped reinvigorate activity, suggesting Beijing would not be able to stimulate the economy through looser monetary policy.“The most worrying aspect of this is not that growth is weak, but that growth is weak despite a torrent of new credit issuance,” said Alistair Thornton, economist at IHS Global Insight.April’s US manufacturing ISM, another barometer of activity, dipped to 50.7 from 51.3 the previous month, signalling a slowdown in growth. Manufacturing activity in the world’s largest economy is now growing at the slowest pace since December 2012. The forward-looking data on export orders also fell to 54 from 56.But was not as bad as some analysts had feared. Sam Coffin, US economist at UBS, said the weaker reading for April likely reflected manufacturers’ restocking of inventories in the first couple of months of the year. “There’s no doubt there’s been some slowing. But if it’s just down to inventories then it should be shortlived.”The Australian Industry Group’s PMI dropped 7.7 points to a four-year low of 36.7 in April, led by a fall in shipments overseas. Exporters blamed the strength of the domestic currency for the sharp decline in manufacturing production, employment and new orders. Although manufacturing only accounts for a small share of the Australian economy – just over 7 per cent of GDP and 8 per cent of total employment – economists said the worsening conditions seen in April were likely to be reflected in other trade-dependent industries.Customise our global economic calendar of data and events, and stay up to date with the latest releases and forecastsAnd in a sign of concern from South Korea, which relies heavily on external demand for growth, Seoul announced $10bn of new financial support to help exporters. The move came as April data showed shipments abroad declined 2.4 per cent compared with March and slowed year-on-year, a move partially blamed on the weaker Japanese currency making exports from that country more competitive.The won has strengthened 21 per cent against the yen over the past seven months and Japan’s exporters may be starting to benefit from the weaker currency, with its manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit and the Japan Materials Management Association, rising to a 13-month high in April. Similarly, a weaker pound helped manufacturing activity in the UK stabilise in April after two months of declines, rising to a three-month high of 49.8, as industry benefited from a rise in new export orders from North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Australia.Reporting by Claire Jones in London, Jamil Anderlini in Beijing, Neil Hume in Sydney and Simon Mundy in Seoul
538;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-05-01T09:06:13Z;Indonesia: PMI-happy, for now;;"While China’s manufacturing indices have been rather depressing of late, Indonesia’s numbers are much healthier.The PMI score came out at 51.7 in April – up from March, a six-month high, and the second highest in the last few years. So, all good?The improvement from March was moderate – just 0.4 points, as the chart below shows. But within the index, new orders expanded for the eleventh consecutive month – evidence of Indonesia’s strengthening domestic demand.And that’s the main difference with China. As Leif Eskesen, chief Asean economist at HSBC pointed out, the Indonesian resilience in the face of tricky global conditions is “thanks to the resilient domestic economy, which is supported by strong structural drivers of growth and very accommodative monetary policy settings.”However, there are a few mild worries on the horizon.The first is inflation, which came in on Wednesday at 5.6 per cent year-on-year – slightly lower than March’s 5.9 per cent, but still above target. A decline in food prices helped, according to data from the statistics bureau.Although inflation seems to be headling the right way, it could go higher if fuel price subsidies are gradually lowered to contain the fiscal and trade deficits – although as Ben Bland reported for beyondbrics on Tuesday, the issue was dodged by the goverment again.The other worry is domestic credit – which is partly fueling the demand that has kept manufacturers happy, and has sparked fears of a property bubble. As Capital Economics pointed out in a recent note, fears that Indonesia is about to experience a credit bubble are overdone, especially when credit levels are compared to other Asian countries such as China and Vietnam.However, credit growth is growing by over 20 per cent year-on-year, which is fast, and also nearly double the rate of nominal GDP growth. Policy makers will need to keep watch that it doesn’t get out of hand. A hike in rates later in 2013 might be just the ticket to cool inflation – and credit.Related reading:

539;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Older shoppers lead Japan’s surge in consumer spending;;Five months after Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, launched “Abenomics”, his push to boost growth is being felt in stores across the nation.Sonoko Yoshimura, a 61-year-old housewife, says she plans to spend about Y1m ($10,200) on curtains, while Hidekazu Otake, 60, a sales manager at a construction company, wants to swap his 46-inch television for a 50-inch model.Both shoppers have been cheered by the fall in the yen sparked by Mr Abe’s aggressive measures to return Japan to growth.Since the previous government called an election in mid-November, share prices of the biggest Japanese companies have risen more than 60 per cent.“My stocks had been performing badly for so long. Now I feel like buying things,” said Mr Otake, who expects to spend another Y1m or so on a trip to Hawaii this year.He is not alone. Many Japanese consumers share the urge to splurge. Data released on Tuesday showed that household spending rose 5.2 per cent in March, its highest year-on-year growth in nine years.The figure was included in mostly bright economic data published on Tuesday. Excluding the effects of a tax increase in 1997 and the 2011 earthquake, sales at large retailers posted their biggest gain in 20 years, rising 2.4 per cent.Last week, the Bank of Japan said the economy had “stopped weakening”, partly on the back of “improvements in household sentiment and the elderly’s large appetite for spending”.Economists reckon consumer spending will contribute about three-quarters of the expected 2.1 per cent growth in Japan’s economy in the first quarter when the government reports the figures.Hajime Takata, chief economist at the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo, said more active consumers are a vital part of the “launch phase” of Mr Abe’s campaign.For the first time, everyone gets the sense that something is happeningAccording to Mr Takata, money hoarded, rather than spent, has been a big contributor to Japan’s stop-start growth and persistent deflation of the past 15 years.“In a deflationary environment, delaying spending was wise. Now, people are starting to think that things will no longer get cheaper,” he said.While consumer spending appears to be rebounding, signals from elsewhere in the economy are more mixed. Industrial production expanded 1.9 per cent between January and March from the previous quarter, halting three quarters of declines, with particularly strong performances from chemicals companies and suppliers of electronics parts.Inventories have also been whittled down, but fragile demand outside Japan means that manufacturers’ forecasts continue to overshoot production.Analysts note that while the weaker yen has improved accounting profits, it may take another month or two to feed through to orders.The FT explains the state of the Japanese economy and outlines the key principles of Abenomics“Changing production contracts can be difficult for customers, and takes time,” said Azusa Kato, an economist at BNP Paribas.Meanwhile, a fall in overall retail sales – down 1.4 per cent in March from February – suggests that the wealth effect of Abenomics is being felt most keenly by richer people, or those with savings to tap.Four-fifths of Japanese households have never held any securities and 88 per cent have never invested in a mutual fund, according to a survey last year by the Japan Securities Dealers Association.Still, Mr Abe has challenged broad expectations of the country’s continuing stagnation. “Now, for the first time, everyone gets the sense that something is happening,” said Kazunori Fuke, chief operating officer of Ma Mere, a chain of boutiques selling imported children’s clothes.Will it work? Mr Fuke smiles and cocks his head. “I don’t know. But it will be impossible to solve our debt situation without an improving economy.”Additional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani
540;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK manufacturing uplift reduces triple-dip fears;;"Britain’s industrial sector made up some lost ground in February, reducing the chances the country would slide into its third technical recession in five years.Industrial production rose more than expected between January and February, prompting the National Institute of Economic and Social Research to forecast the economy would show a growth rate of 0.1 per cent for the first quarter of the year.While such meagre growth would do nothing to change the pattern of persistent economic stagnation in Britain since 2010, it would allow the coalition government to avoid politically-damaging “triple-dip recession” headlines. Recessions are commonly defined as two or more successive quarters of economic contraction; the economy shrank 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.Simon Kirby, an economist at Niesr, said the big picture was more important than the bumps in the data. “Although people will be focusing on whether we hit or miss this “triple-dip” recession . . . the best description of the UK economy is flat.”Mr Kirby added he had not taken account of the recent snowy weather in his forecast.Niesr’s estimate came on the day the Office for National Statistics said industrial production rose 1 per cent between January and February, driven by a 0.8 per cent rise in manufacturing output and a stronger recovery in mining and quarrying. The broad improvement was better than economists had expected, though it still only partially reversed a steep drop in output in January.Meanwhile, separate ONS data showed Britain’s trade deficit in February was the widest since August as exports fell and imports rose, further evidence of the country’s failure to “rebalance” towards external demand.There has been a mixture of economic signals in recent weeks. In one of the better signs, the British Retail Consortium reports consumers ignored the cold weather and went shopping in MarchSamuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said: “While February’s UK industrial production and trade data increase the chances that the economy has just about avoided a so-called triple-dip recession, they hardly paint a picture of strength.”Industrial production, two-thirds of which is accounted for by manufacturing, was 2.2 per cent lower in February than in the same month a year earlier. The sector has been in steady decline since early 2011.The trade deficit, which is based on a notoriously volatile data set, was £3.6bn in February, up from £2.5bn in January. The ONS said the largest fall in exports was in goods to non-EU countries, which included a £329m fall in exports to the USA.There has been a mixture of positive and negative economic signals in recent weeks. In one of the better signs, the British Retail Consortium on Tuesday reported consumers ignored the cold weather and went shopping in March. Retailers reported a 3.7 per cent rise in sales values from the same month a year earlier."
541;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-04-04T22:12:07Z;Bank keeps QE on hold as services improve;;The Bank of England chose not to restart the printing presses on Thursday amid mixed signals about the health of the economy, including evidence that the service sector was faring better than feared.Investors were unsurprised by the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to keep the stock of asset purchases in its quantitative easing programme on hold at £375bn. The decision came hours after the Bank of Japan announced an ambitious new strategy to combat deflation.The economic data released over the past month have not been uniformly strong or weak enough to change the overall stance of the MPC, economists concluded. Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing governor, was in a minority of three in voting in February and March for more QE.Adding to the mixed economic signals, the purchasing managers’ index for services, an unofficial gauge of the health of the sector that accounts for about three quarters of Britain’s economy, climbed from 51.8 in February to 52.4 in March.This increase above the 50 mark – which separates expansion from contraction – implies activity grew at the fastest pace since August, when businesses were boosted by the London Olympics. It also implies that the sector is faring much better than the manufacturing and building sectors, both of which are still contracting, according to the PMI surveys.Economists said the services survey reduced the likelihood that the economy as a whole would contract in the first quarter and put the UK into a technical recession for the third time in five years.However, several said the latest data were consistent with quarterly economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter.“Even if the UK economy is growing, it isn’t doing it fast enough,” said David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas. “That is in effect the argument for continued monetary inventiveness in the UK. It is not just to avoid the pit of recession but to achieve some decent quality of output growth for a sustained period.”Though the BoE, like the BoJ, has been under pressure to do more to stimulate the moribund economy, economists think any move would be more likely to come in May, after the first estimate of economic output in the first quarter, and coinciding with the central bank’s quarterly inflation report.Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said he expected the MPC to vote for more “unconventional” policies rather than simply for more QE.“The MPC and government have now both signalled that preparations are under way to expand and extend the Funding for Lending Scheme,” he said of the programme that uses cheap funding to try to incentivise banks to expand lending. “We also expect the MPC to explore other non-QE easing options. It is likely that the analytical work required to decide how best to ease further will take until at least the May inflation report.”Investors and economists also think the arrival of Mark Carney as the new BoE governor in July, will prompt changes. Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec, said: “His arrival, and the stock-take that comes with it, may be enough to provide the committee with the clarity it needs on its forward strategy and the efforts needed to find ‘escape velocity’.”
542;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-04-04T17:11:01Z;Hollande approval rating hits new low;;François Hollande’s approval rating has sunk to a new low, underlining the uphill battle France’s socialist president faces to overcome a combination of political scandal and economic downturn.A poll published on Thursday showed just 27 per cent of voters had confidence in Mr Hollande, a three-point fall over the past month and the lowest score for a president 11 months into his term of office for more than 30 years.The TNS Sofres poll was taken before the admission this week by Jérôme Cahuzac, Mr Hollande’s former budget minister, that he had lied for months when he denied holding a secret Swiss bank account. That revelation unleashed a political storm that threatens to damage the president’s standing further.Compounding Mr Hollande’s discomfort, an investigation into global tax havens by a group of international media, including France’s Le Monde newspaper, revealed that businessman Jean-Jacques Augier, who was the president’s election campaign treasurer, had investments in two companies registered in the Cayman Islands. Mr Hollande has campaigned strongly for curbs on such “paradis fiscaux”, as tax havens are called in France.Mr Augier, a friend of Mr Hollande since they were classmates at Ena, one of the elite grandes écoles, insisted his shareholdings in a bookshop chain and online travel agency based in China were open and legal and that he had gained no tax advantage from the set-up.Speaking at a press conference during a visit to Morocco, Mr Hollande said he “knew nothing about the activities” of Mr Augier, adding that if there had been any breach of tax laws the authorities should investigate.He said he was determined to “go all the way” to “moralise political and economic life” in France, which had been “humiliated for years by a succession of (such) affairs”.The timing of the revelation fuelled the controversy dogging the government over the case of Mr Cahuzac, budget minister until last month, whom Mr Hollande had previously backed when he denied allegations that he had dodged French taxes by holding an account in Switzerland.A poll by CSA, taken as the tax fraud scandal unfolded, showed a 29 per cent approval level for Mr Hollande, down four points from last month.The Cahuzac affair has opened up Mr Hollande and his government to accusations of hypocrisy at a time when they have sharply raised taxes and are preparing tough spending cuts, calling on the country to make sacrifices to help reduce the budget deficit and high public debt.“The myth that the left is more virtuous has been definitively dispelled,” tweeted Alain Juppé, a former right-of-centre prime minister.Mr Hollande’s standing was already weakened by the fragile economy and unemployment, which has risen sharply since he took office in May. On Thursday, there were further signs that the economy, flat for the past year, remains stalled. The latest Markit purchasing managers’ index for the service sector showed a sharp decline in activity in March, falling for the eighth month running to 41.3 from 43.7 in February, the lowest score since February 2009.As the Cahuzac scandal continued to resonate, two key ministers came under fire from the opposition UMP party. Both Pierre Moscovici, finance minister, and Manuel Valls, interior minister, were forced to issue strong denials that they either knew about Mr Cahuzac’s Swiss account or sought to protect him.
543;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-04-04T16:52:32Z;Blackstone in ETF alliance with State Street;Launching first actively managed senior loan ETF;Blackstone is teaming up with State Street Global Advisors to launch the first actively-managed senior loan exchange traded fund in an alliance that provides further evidence of alternative investment managers’ growing interest in the ETF market.The ETF, which will be known by its ticker SRLN, has been developed by GSO Capital Partners, the credit arm of Blackstone, and SSgA, the world’s second largest ETF manager.SRLN is designed with the aim of outperforming two senior loan benchmarks: the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan index and the S&P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 index.Typically 30 to 35 per cent of loans fall out of the benchmark indices in any given year so Blackstone and SSgA argue that the ability to anticipate changes in the market through an active strategy is potentially advantageous.“Given the high turnover of senior loans and the critical importance of credit selection, we believe an active strategy provides a key advantage to investors who want access to this corner of the market,” said James Ross, global head of SPDR exchange traded funds at SSgA.The new ETF carries an annual expense ratio of 90 basis points compared with traditional actively managed senior loan mutual funds, which typically charge between 111bp and 178bp.Leverage loan mutual funds have seen inflows rise strongly this year with greater inflows in the first 10 weeks of 2013 than the whole of 2012, according to Lipper data. Investor interest has risen as loans have floating interest rates and so should provide some protection from future increases in policy interest rates.
544;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-04-03T10:15:24Z;Small businesses continue loans struggle;;Lenders are expecting a significant increase in demand for loans from small businesses over the next three months but have no plans to make more credit available to them, according to a survey by the Bank of England.The central bank’s latest quarterly survey of lenders highlights the continuing struggle of smaller companies to borrow money, even as the credit squeeze starts to ease for the rest of the economy.Lenders told the BoE they had increased mortgage availability for the third successive quarter and credit availability to large companies for the second successive quarter. However, they said loan availability for small and medium sized companies did not change.Although lenders expect “significant increases” in credit demand in the second quarter of the year from both small and large companies, they said corporate credit availability for all but the large businesses would be “little changed”.The survey results will intensify pressure on the BoE and the Treasury to modify their joint Funding for Lending Scheme, which supplies banks with cheap funding, to try to improve the flow of credit to smaller companies.The scheme appears to have had some impact on mortgage lending but less effect on business loans. BoE data this week showed overall lending to both households and companies is still falling at an annual rate of 0.1 per cent.Respondents to the BoE’s survey also said spreads were tightening on most sorts of loans, including ones to small businesses, and cited the FLS as one of the reasons for this.BoE data up to February show interest rates on new mortgages have fallen since the FLS was launched in the summer, especially for fixed rate loans at higher loan-to-value ratios. However, rates on new business loans have fallen a lot less.Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said: “There is nothing in today’s survey to lead us to expect anything other than a continuation of a very gradual recovery in bank lending. Policy makers may have to make the FLS more generous or resort to bolder options, such as recapitalising the banks, if they want lending to support an economic recovery.”Priyen Patel, policy adviser at the Federation of Small Businesses, said there was a “policy tension” that needed to be resolved between the regulatory push for Britain’s large banks to raise more capital, and the political push to “lend more, lend more, lend more”.Separately, a survey of construction companies on Wednesday suggested the small and long-suffering sector continued to contract in March. The Markit purchasing managers’ “activity index” for the sector was 47.2 in March, slightly higher than in February, but still below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, which compiles the surveys, said falling investment spending and “intermittent output disruptions amid unusually bad weather” depressed the sector in the first quarter.“The negative print for construction output mirrors that seen for manufacturing, and now leaves the service sector as the last great hope for avoiding another slide in UK gross domestic product,” he said.The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee is due to vote on Thursday amid mixed economic signals on whether to pump more stimulus into the economy.
545;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-04-02T20:24:18Z;Record eurozone unemployment hurts euro;;The euro fell against other major currencies on concerns over the health of the eurozone economy as the single currency struggled to recover from losses after the Cyprus bailout.The euro dipped 0.2 per cent against the dollar to trade below $1.2850 as figures showed that eurozone unemployment hit a record high of 12 per cent in both February and January, after numbers for the first month of the year were revised upwards from 11.9 per cent.The single currency had already come under pressure after figures showed that eurozone manufacturing activity hit a three-month low in March, although the contraction in the sector was slightly less than previously estimated, data from Markit showed.The UK pound fell on concerns over the health of the UK economy, after figures showed mortgage approvals declined for the second month in a row while Markit data suggested that manufacturing activity contracted again in March, albeit at a slower rate than the previous month. Sterling fell 0.8 per cent against the dollar to $1.5100 and was 0.6 per cent lower against the euro at €1.1776.The Japanese yen reversed earlier gains against the dollar and the euro ahead of the Bank of Japan’s two-day meeting this week as traders positioned themselves for expected changes to the BoJ’s monetary policy. The yen has been on a strengthening trend in recent weeks ahead of the BoJ meeting amid caution over whether the BoJ will surprise investors.“With the remaining risks for global markets becoming rather more apparent in recent weeks, we should not entirely dismiss the possibility of a sharp reversal in post November trend towards yen weakness emerging,” said Simon Derrick, foreign currency strategist at BNY Mellon.The dollar rose 0.2 per cent to Y93.56 and the euro rose 0.1 per cent to Y120.14.The Australian dollar rose 0.2 per cent to $1.0446 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates on hold at 3 per cent, maintaining the country’s status as the developed nation with the highest yielding currency.But the central bank repeated previous warnings that its inflation forecasts “left scope” to ease further in the future if needed.

547;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-03-28T11:46:25Z;Service sector shows modest growth;;The output of Britain’s large service sector increased modestly in January, reducing the risk of the economy sliding into another technical recession.Data show output in the sector, which accounts for 77 per cent of the economy, increased 0.3 per cent between December and January and by 0.8 per cent from the same month a year ago.However, because there was a sharp monthly drop in services output in December, the recovery in January still left output lower than it was two months earlier.The figures for January, which will feed into the gross domestic product estimate for the first quarter, offer some reassurance after news that the manufacturing and construction sectors contracted in the same month.Another quarterly GDP contraction would put Britain back into a technical recession – its third since 2008 as the economy has struggled to recover from the financial crisis.“The odds are swinging towards . . . avoiding another GDP fall in the first quarter, as long as the latest bout of snow does not have a significant distorting impact,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, a consultancy.Chris Williamson, an economist at data company Markit, said the news “provides some encouragement that the UK is showing some resilience in the face of headwinds from the eurozone and continuing pressures on consumers at home, such as rising prices and weak pay growth.”Business surveys have indicated the service sector picked up momentum in February.However, Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Capital, said that on his calculations the economy would still shrink 0.1 per cent on current trends. “There is nothing here to change our view that a triple dip is coming,” he said.The January service sector data show output in the transport, storage and communication sector jumped 1.3 per cent, while the government and business services sectors grew a more modest 0.3 per cent. Output stagnated in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, which the ONS said was partly because of the effects of heavy snow.
548;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-03-21T20:11:23Z;Cyprus and growth concerns hit euro;;The euro fell back below $1.29 against the dollar on renewed concerns over the situation in Cyprus and fears over the health of the wider eurozone economy. The single currency dipped 0.4 per cent to $1.2879 as eurozone ministers gathered to discuss the Cyprus crisis after politicians there voted against a controversial set of measures aimed at saving the country’s banking system from collapse.The euro fell in early trading after the European Central Bank said it would only continue to provide emergency liquidity to Cyprus until Monday if a bailout was not approved. Concerns over the eurozone economy were also weighing on the single currency after figures showed that Germany’s private sector was growing at a slower rate and the business sector across the eurozone slumped further in March.The monthly Markit purchasing managers’ index showed that the German private sector grew at its slowest rate this year while business activity across the eurozone contracted at its fastest rate in four months.The Markit composite index for the eurozone fell from 47.9 to 46.5 in March, against expectations of 48.2. In France, private sector growth fell to its lowest level in four years. The euro shed 0.7 per cent to its lowest level against the pound in more than five weeks at £0.8486 and was 1.5 per cent lower against the yen at Y122.26. The yen rose against other major currencies after Haruhiko Kuroda, the new governor of the Bank of Japan, said in his first press conference he would ease monetary policy further. But he stopped short of calling a special BoJ meeting this month to implement any changes. The dollar fell 1.3 per cent to Y94.76.The pound rose against the dollar in the wake of the UK Budget, which saw sterling gain after proposed changes to the Bank of England’s monetary policy mandate were less radical than some had expected. Sterling gained 0.5 per cent to touch just above $1.52 after UK retail sales were better than expected, rising 2.1 per cent in February from the previous month.
549;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
550;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-03-11T00:01:40Z;City jobs decline easing, say recruiters;;The City of London’s jobs decline is showing signs of easing, a Square Mile recruitment company has reported.Morgan McKinley said the number of new vacancies rose 11 per cent last month compared with January. The total of 2,583 was still 15 per cent down on a year ago but the decrease was smaller than in previous months.Hakan Enver, operations director, said: “It’s a promising start to the year to see job availability rise again.“It indicates there is still an appetite to hire with continued momentum following the increased number of available jobs in January.”He said the FTSE’s performance during February “will undoubtedly have raised the level of confidence across the City, which is always quick to be influenced by key indicators”.In addition, he said the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index showed the fastest rise in business activity for five months – another sign of positive sentiment throughout the UK.“There is still demand in the functions that require regulatory expertise,” Mr Enver said. “Also operations professionals are in demand, particularly within the investment banking and asset management sectors.”Remuneration continued to rise. Those securing new jobs in February saw an average 10 per cent rise in salaries. Mr Enver said the increase had been a trend over the past year which he expected to continue. Pockets that were experiencing demand would encourage employers to be competitive.He said the EU’s plan to cap bonuses at 100% of annual salary was likely to ensure continuation of increasing pay.
551;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Services data allay fears on economy;;More money printing from the Bank of England later this week appears a close call after data for the UK’s dominant services sector showed economic activity was far livelier than most expected.Activity in the services sector, which makes up more than three-quarters of economic output, surged by the biggest margin in five months in February, soothing fears that Britain’s economy will shrink in the first quarter.The purchasing managers’ index for services, compiled by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, rose to 51.8, its highest level since September, beating analysts’ expectations. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity.Economists and traders are split on whether the BoE will restart the printing presses following the Monetary Policy Committee vote, due out at noon on Thursday. But the strong PMI for the services sector makes the MPC less likely to sanction further gilt purchases, often referred to as quantitative easing.“Had today’s services PMI survey disappointed and recorded slower growth – or even a contraction – then we would have had no hesitation in revising our forecast for more quantitative easing,” said George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.Sterling, which has weakened in recent weeks on raised prospects of more action from the BoE, temporarily spiked against the US dollar on the news. The pound rose nearly a cent to touch just below $1.52.The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee monitors the PMIs, often mentioning the gauge of activity in minutes of policy meetings.The strong services PMI follows weak figures for the manufacturing and construction industries, which had stoked expectations of more money printing. However, the services sector accounts for more than three-quarters of economic output, compared with less than 20 per cent for manufacturing and construction combined.“Faster growth of the services sector offset downturns in manufacturing and construction during February,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “The economy is likely to have grown for a second successive month after the downturn late last year.”The strong services PMI suggests the UK could avoid a triple-dip recession of two straight quarters of negative growth.Tuesday’s data signalled activity would remain buoyant in the coming months as new business activity increased by the sharpest pace since last May.The construction and manufacturing PMIs could also rebound in March. January’s heavy snowfall was blamed for some of the weakness in the indices last month, while the impact of China’s lunar new year on global trade flows weakened activity for manufacturers in the UK and elsewhere.However, the BoE will be more concerned that output has barely budged since 2010 and that a meaningful economic recovery continues to elude the UK.On the back of these concerns, three members of the MPC, including governor Sir Mervyn King, supported an additional £25bn-worth of purchases at last month’s policy vote. Two more members of the nine-strong committee need to change their minds for the BoE to restart quantitative easing, which has been dormant since last July.Jens Larsen, economist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “We do not see any MPC member who voted for an unchanged stance last month changing their position on the back of the [PMI] data, and maintain our view that Thursday’s meeting is unlikely to lead to a change in policy stance.”Michael Saunders of Citi said: “These figures are not weak enough to make extra QE this week a certainty, but nor are they strong enough to make extra stimulus unnecessary. On balance, we continue to expect that the MPC will announce an extra £25bn of QE this week.”The BoE has already bought £375bn of government debt.Additional reporting by Alice Ross
552;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;RBA rate hold lifts Australian dollar;;The Australian dollar rose after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates on hold even as it said the strength of the currency was higher than might have been expected.Glenn Stevens, governor of the central bank, said the downside risks to global growth had lessened over recent months and financial strains in Europe were “considerably reduced”, as he made no change to the 3 per cent base rate.The Aussie gained 0.5 per cent to $1.0241 against the US dollar and was 0.1 per cent higher against the Japanese yen at Y95.49 after the RBA said there had already been significant easing in Australia over the past year, although it did retain the option of easing further if conditions changed. Australia’s interest rates remain the highest of any nation in the Group of 10 countries.The US dollar rose against most other main currencies after figures showed the US services sector expanded at its fastest rate in a year in February, adding to hopes of a US economic recovery.The dollar index clawed back earlier losses after the Institute for Supply Management released its survey results showing a larger than expected rise in the index last month.The UK pound failed to hold on to gains after figures showed the services sector expanded by more than expected in February. The data initially helped sterling to touch $1.5199 against the dollar, but it was later 0.1 per cent lower on the day at $1.51.The euro gave up earlier gains after a purchasing managers’ index from Markit showed the eurozone services sector had contracted at a slower rate than expected in February.The single currency initially rose 0.4 per cent to $1.3075 but was later 0.1 per cent lower at $1.3021.The yen was stronger as investors continued to take profits on short positions on the currency taken out in recent weeks, with traders seeing few new developments on the horizon until the Bank of Japan’s meeting in April, which will see a more dovish governor at the helm. The dollar hit a session low of Y92.89 but was later just 0.1 per cent weaker at Y93.34.
553;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-03-04T11:56:01Z;Construction index hits three-year low;;Activity in the UK’s struggling construction industry plunged at its fastest rate to its lowest level in more than three years in February, according to a poll of purchasing managers.The purchasing managers’ index for the construction industry, compiled by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, fell to 46.8 in February, its lowest since October 2009.The index has been below 50 – the mark that separates a contraction from an expansion in activity – for the past four months.The decline has come with sharp falls in commercial building and civil engineering activity. Housebuilding performed better, with activity expanding for the first time since May 2012.Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, said: “This is undoubtedly a dismal set of data for the UK construction sector, especially the sharp falls in commercial building work and civil engineering.”New orders fell for the second month in a row, signalling the sector will perform poorly in the coming months, though confidence in future activity is at its highest since April 2012.The disappointing construction figure follows the release of a poorer-than-expected PMI for manufacturing last week.“The construction PMI adds to the downbeat tone of February activity data created by Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey,” said Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays. “However, construction accounts for only 7 per cent of GDP, and the correspondence between the construction PMI and the official output data is poor.”The PMI for the UK’s dominant services sector is due tomorrow. If that disappoints, then some analysts expect the Bank of England to restart its money printing and sanction more government bond purchases on Thursday.
554;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-03-01T18:36:17Z;UK manufacturing falls sharply;;Fallout from the loss of the UK’s prized triple A credit rating may have been less dramatic than George Osborne feared. But data released this week serve as a grim reminder to the chancellor of the scale of the task confronting him as he prepares for this month’s budget.Financial markets shrugged off the news that Moody’s, the credit rating agency, had downgraded the UK by one notch to Aa1 last week.But the pound on Friday plunged to a two-and-a-half-year low against the dollar after weak figures on manufacturing activity rekindled fears that meaningful growth would continue to elude the UK.Manufacturing activity in the UK, which makes up more than 10 per cent of the economy, shrank in February as tough market conditions at home and abroad damped demand, according to an influential poll of purchasing managers.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, compiled by Markit and CIPS, fell to 47.9, its lowest level since October and far worse than analysts had expected. A figure below 50 signals a contraction in activity.The weak data are a further blow to the hopes of Mr Osborne and the Bank of England that the UK will be able to export its way out of trouble. It also stoked concerns that the UK economy would contract for the second successive quarter in the three months to March, resulting in the much-feared triple-dip recession.“The return to contraction is a big surprise and represents a major setback to hopes that the UK economy can return to growth in the first quarter and avoid a triple-dip recession,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit.Economic output has now barely budged since 2010, with the lack of a meaningful recovery one of the key factors behind Moody’s downgrade.Friday’s data increase pressure on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to authorise additional money printing when it meets on Thursday. It emerged last week that three of nine MPC members, including governor Sir Mervyn King, voted for more quantitative easing in February.“We still think it likely the MPC will keep policy on hold, although Friday’s weak data provide the case for further QE with a certain degree of extra momentum,” said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec.Much will hinge on whether Tuesday’s purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of the economy, is as bad as the manufacturing PMI.The BoE may also be cautious about reading too much into a single piece of data. Markit said the January weather had a knock-on effect on the February figures, as heavy snow disrupted deliveries.In contrast to the poor manufacturing data, official figures for the construction industry were unexpectedly positive. The Office for National Statistics on Friday reported that construction order volumes rose 3.4 per cent in the final three months of 2012, leaving orders up 11.2 per cent year-on-year. Construction makes up between 6 and 7 per cent of gross domestic product.

556;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-02-27T13:44:12Z;Cameron defends economic record;;Britain’s failure to “rebalance” the economy away from a reliance on government and household spending was underlined on Wednesday by data showing both exports and business investment fell in the final quarter of last year.The official figures, which came less than a week after Britain’s rating downgrade refocused the world’s attention on the struggling economy, confirmed that output shrank 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, as had been initially estimated.More significantly, they painted a picture of a very differently shaped economy to the one that policymakers envisaged two years ago. At that time, the expected “rebalancing” of the economy was seen as the silver lining of the financial crisis.The official budget watchdog predicted an imminent shift away from private and government spending and towards net trade and investment, helped by the biggest fall in the value of sterling since the second world war. It forecast that in 2012, net trade would contribute 1 percentage point to economic growth and business investment would contribute 0.8 percentage points.Yet Wednesday’s data show net trade actually subtracted almost 1 percentage point from growth in 2012, while business investment contributed just 0.4 percentage points. In spite of falling real wages and austerity, the biggest drivers of growth were household spending and government spending on goods and services.“The rebalancing thing is just clearly not happening,” said Michael Saunders, an economist at Citi.What has gone wrong? One of the main explanations for Britain’s disappointing export performance has been a steep drop in financial services exports, which have lost market share in spite of the decline in the value of sterling. “We are now offering financial services at a 25 per cent discount to the world compared to 2006, and no-one wants them,” said Amit Kara, an economist at UBS. “Banking is unloved, but it’s something we excel in: it’s a very specific shock to the UK.”Goods exports have performed a little better, though they have not increased as much as policymakers hoped. Sterling has started to fall again over the past few months, which could give an extra boost to exports, though economists warn the cheaper currency will probably increase inflation before it helps net trade.Business investment, meanwhile, has suffered amid huge uncertainty in the corporate world about the future level of demand. The sclerotic banking system has also made it much harder for small and medium sized companies to borrow money. Still, with the level of business investment still 10 per cent below its level in 2008, many economists think some sort of pick-up will soon be inevitable, simply because buildings and machinery will be wearing out.Meanwhile, even though households and the government have been the biggest contributors do growth, they cannot do much more as both groups try to pay down debt and adjust their spending patterns to a new and rather bleaker economic future.Household spending has been particularly squeezed by Britain’s problem with persistently high inflation, which has eroded real wages. With the Bank of England predicting inflation will remain above its 2 per cent target for the next two years, this squeeze is unlikely to go away.“We need households to feel confident enough to reduce their savings to drive any kind of consumption growth at all really,” said Simon Wells, an economist at HSBC.Finally, government spending is unlikely to provide much support to the economy in the next few years. Britain is only about two-fifths of the way through its austerity programme, and 80 per cent of the planned spending cuts have yet to be made.
557;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-02-25T13:19:33Z;UK borrowers focus on paying debt;;The January snow weighed on borrowing by British households and businesses, according to a trade body for lenders.The British Bankers’ Association said mortgage approvals fell 14 per cent in January compared with a year earlier.It also reported a small change in net mortgage lending – the difference between the amount of mortgages approved and loans repaid – in the year to January. Unsecured borrowing fell 1.6 per cent in the year to January as consumers repaid loans and overdrafts.“ January’s severe weather impacted adversely on what was already a subdued picture of borrowing demand from households and businesses,” said David Dooks, the BBA’s statistical director.“While general economic growth stalls, low consumer and business confidence generates a natural tendency to restrain borrowing appetite, repay borrowing where possible and to build up cash and a savings buffer.”Businesses continued to repay existing loans, rather than borrow more, according to the BBA data. However, the pace at which net lending contracted fell sharply, from £3.1bn over the course of last year to £200m in the 12 months to January.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, described the figures for business lending as “a big disappointment”. “[They] suggest that business[es] do not have the appetite to borrow to invest and expand,” Mr Williamson said.
558;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-02-17T18:32:41Z;Britons saving less as living costs soar;;Britons are saving less as the cost of living rises at its fastest pace since September 2011, according to two separate studies on the state of household finances.UK savers held just £1,678 on average in accessible savings at the end of last year, according to a quarterly survey of nearly 6,000 people by ING Direct, down from £2,020 four years ago when the study began. Savings, defined as money in easy-access bank accounts, showed a slight decline of £23 on average from the third quarter of last year.Three-quarters of those surveyed said energy bills had put their finances under the most strain in 2012, followed by food shopping and vehicle fuel.Two-fifths said they had tried to buy more “value” items at the supermarket or cut down on treats, while a fifth had switched to a cheaper supermarket. A quarter said they felt that feeding their family a healthy diet was too expensive.A separate survey from Markit found that people on lower incomes saw the largest squeeze on their finances in at least four years, according to a monthly survey of around 1,500 people.Those in the second-lowest income bracket, on £15,000-£23,000, reported more deterioration in their finances in February, according to a methodology that measures the number noting a rise, fall or no change in their financial situation.More than two-fifths of all those surveyed expected their finances to get worse in the next year, while just 23 per cent thought they would improve. A quarter said their savings had dropped in February compared with the previous month, while 12 per cent said they had increased.
559;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-02-05T18:03:33Z;Yen tumbles as BoJ head signals early exit;;The dollar hit its strongest level against the Japanese yen since May 2010 after the head of Japan’s central bank said he would step down earlier than expected, fuelling optimism that a new regime would act to combat deflation and weaken the yen.The dollar rose more than 1 per cent to touch Y93.50 after Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, said he would stand down three weeks earlier than planned.Expectations that the new government in Japan would appoint a BoJ governor more likely to get tough on deflation and weaken the yen have been a key driver in the recent sell-off of the Japanese currency. The euro clawed back losses earlier in the week after figures showed that the eurozone’s services sector contracted less than expected in January, though data were mixed across different countries. Purchasing managers’ indices from Markit showed that business activity in Germany’s services sector grew at its fastest rate since June 2011 while Spain’s services industry saw its slowest contraction for 19 months in January. However, jobs in Italy’s services sector shrank at a record rate as business activity fell and France’s services fell at the fastest rate in nearly three years.The euro rose 0.4 per cent to $1.3573 and was 1.2 per cent higher against sterling at £0.8685.The Australian dollar fell against other leading currencies after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates on hold but warned that it might cut rates in the future.Australia’s currency lost 0.4 per cent against its US counterpart to $1.0393 after the RBA said its outlook for inflation meant there was “scope to ease policy further” and said Australia’s exchange rate still looked too high. “The more dovish than expected RBA statement supports our view that it will probably continue to lower its target rate towards 2.5 per cent in 2013, which will have only a modest weakening impact on the Australian dollar as yields will still be relatively high in Australia,” said analysts at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
560;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK services sector brightens in January;;The UK’s dominant services sector returned to growth in January, according to a gauge of activity.The news provided more evidence that the economy managed to shrug off the ill-effects of last month’s cold snap.The purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, compiled by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, indicated that activity grew in January after contracting for the first time in two years in December.The January PMI beat analysts’ expectations, registering 51.5, the highest reading since September, up from 48.9 in the final month of 2012. A figure above 50 signals expansion.Purchasing managers reported an increase in activity, despite January’s snow and a rise in new orders – a signal that activity could grow more in future months. Business confidence rose to its highest level in eight months and businesses also reported hiring more workers.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “Stronger growth would inevitably have been recorded had the country not suffered the heavy snowfall, suggesting the underlying trend is even stronger than these numbers indicate.”The positive number for the services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of economic output, follows last week’s release of a better than expected PMI reading for manufacturers.The PMIs, along with reports that the retail sector recovered last month after a poor December, will allay fears that the cold weather would trigger a triple-dip recession of two quarters of economic contraction.“January’s services PMI echoes the other data released in recent days suggesting that the economy has been doing a bit better since the start of the year,” said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.Analysts said the favourable reading for the services PMI all but ruled out the chances of the Bank of England easing policy this week.“This PMI was a key release heading into the MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] meeting on Thursday,” said David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas. “The weakness in the December reading raised some anxiety that the underlying pace of the economy was slowing, on top of the erratic effects that lowered gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2012. The rebound in the services PMI, along with other more positive indicators, soothe those concerns.”
561;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-02-04T10:47:02Z;Building sector continues to suffer;;Britain’s long-suffering construction sector had another difficult month in January, though companies said they were a little more confident and had taken on new workers for the first time in four months.The Markit purchasing managers’ index, which is based on a monthly survey of construction companies, was 48.7 in January, unchanged from December. A number under 50 implies overall business activity was contracting.The construction sector struggled last year, according to official data, shrinking by more than 10 per cent, as the government has cut investment spending and the housing market has remained moribund.Though construction only accounts for about 6 per cent of the UK economy, it has been a drag on overall growth.Monday’s survey suggested the sector’s problems continued in January. However, there were improvements in some areas: the index that measures activity on housing projects increased from 43.1 to 47.1, implying the decline in these sorts of projects was slowing. The index for commercial projects climbed from 47.9 to 50.In addition, companies hired more workers after cutting headcount in the final three months of last year. They also said their expectations were slightly brighter. New business declined again, but at the slowest pace for four months.Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, the data company that compiled the survey, said: “January’s survey results are yet another indicator of the severe underlying fragility across the UK construction sector.”He said heavy snow in January might have disrupted construction companies to some extent, though it was clear the sector had much bigger problems than just the weather.“Construction firms reported improved optimism about the business outlook, although much of this appeared to rest on hopes that the chorus of calls for greater public sector investment spending starts to come to fruition.”

A rise in new orders signalled manufacturing activity would continue to expand in the coming months.Global industrial activity expanded at its fastest pace in 10 months in January and trade volumes – a bellwether of the health of the global economy – fell at the slowest pace in nine months, according to the purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing, compiled by JPMorgan and Markit.Within the single currency bloc, manufacturing activity continued to shrink. But the contraction in the eurozone was less pronounced than in recent months, while official data showed unemployment stabilised and inflation dropped to the European Central Bank’s target of 2 per cent.The PMI for manufacturing for the euro area rose to 47.9, up from 46.1 in December – the highest level in 11 months. Though the reading remains below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion, the third straight increase bolsters predictions that the eurozone economy could begin to expand later this year.“While the industrial sector looks likely to have acted as a drag on the eurozone economy in the final quarter of last year, deepening the double-dip downturn, the PMI provides hope that the first quarter could mark the start of a turnround,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, was the main driver of the increase, as the PMI for the country’s manufacturing sector rose to an 11-month high of 49.8 on the back of stronger export output and new business orders.France was the only one of the eurozone’s five largest economies to suffer a further decline. The PMI for the bloc’s second-largest economy dropped to a four-month low of 42.9 as high unemployment and depressed business orders weighed on activity.While the industrial sector looks likely to have acted as a drag on the eurozone economy in the final quarter of last year . . . the PMI provides hope that the first quarter could mark the start of a turnroundHSBC’s manufacturing PMI for China rose to 52.3 in January from 51.5 in December. China’s official manufacturing PMI came in above 50 for a fourth straight month, signalling a sustained expansion in activity, though it edged down to 50.4 in January from 50.6 in December – an indication of slightly slower growth. However, analysts cautioned against reading too much into the PMI numbers because economic data in China are heavily distorted by the coming lunar new year.“The PMI is a quite inaccurate barometer around the Chinese New Year holiday,” said Lu Ting, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We believe the Chinese economy and its related asset markets will remain in a sweet spot in the near term.”The official PMI is generally seen as reflective of state-owned companies, while the HSBC version is a better proxy for the private sector.Manufacturing activity continued to expand in the UK last month despite the snow.The UK manufacturing PMI fell only slightly last month, to 50.8 from 51.4 in December, despite some economists warning that last month’s cold weather could heighten the risk of a triple-dip recession in the UK.Additional reporting by Emma Dong

564;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Hedging tool to boost CMBS issuance;;Banks are being given a tool to hedge their holdings of commercial mortgages in a development expected to boost issuance of related securities and help bring new money into the US property sector.Markit is launching a new CMBS index, which lenders can trade to reduce the risk of holding loans while they wait to be packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities.The launch could unleash a wave of speculation on the commercial property market and the value of commercial mortgages since traders will be able to bet on the performance of recently issued CMBS.The Markit CMBX Series 6 index went live on Friday, calculated from the costs of insuring against default on 25 of the latest CMBS issues. CMBS are securities created from pools of commercial mortgages. By selling on their loans, mortgage originators are freed up to lend again.Investors have been clamouring for CMBS because of their relatively high yields but, despite a 35 per cent uptick last year, supply remains tight because older US CMBS are maturing.Analysts say it could remove a bottleneck that has limited new supply since it could help originators reluctant to warehouse loans while they wait to be packaged into CMBS.“To get back to a healthy cycle, you need an effective hedge,” said David Cook of Barclays. “Nobody will be willing to run a naked long warehousing position in case there are macroeconomic hiccups. This will be the first truly effective hedging tool for originators, post-crisis.”A dearth of CMBS issuance forced Markit to suspend launches in its CMBX series after the fifth iteration in 2008 and it has loosened the criteria for inclusion in the new Series 6, potentially making the index more volatile.The underlying CMBS pools need not contain as many mortgages, as many borrowers or as diverse a portfolio of properties that used to be demanded.The value of the index will be fixed daily based on quotes submitted by 12 investment bank trading desks.Speculators are already drilling down into the details of the 25 underlying securities, to examine how the index may trade, including into the exposure to big box retailers whose competitive difficulties threaten to hurt the value of some shopping centre mortgages.Richard Hill, CMBS strategist at RBS, said the index could be used by originators hedging their exposure and by investors.“We believe CMBX 6 may allow investors to more efficiently express their views of relative value across the CMBS capital structure,” he wrote in a note to clients.

in Japan, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said a value of Y100 against the dollar would not be a problem for the country’s economy. The comments came as Japan recorded its largest ever trade deficit in 2012 due in part to the strong yen. The dollar gained 1.7 per cent to Y90.14 while the euro rose more than 2 per cent to Y120.57. Manufacturing figures released by purchasing managers in various countries on Thursday were also being closely watched as an indicator of economic recovery. Asian currencies rallied in early trading after better than expected manufacturing PMI data in China.The sector showed its strongest rate of expansion in two years, according to an HSBC index. Eurozone PMI data were mixed, however, with a significant gap between the region’s two largest economies as measured by the Markit purchasing managers’ index.Growth across the eurozone in general was at its highest level in 10 months and its strongest in Germany in a year.But the French private sector reported the steepest monthly downturn in nearly four years in January. The euro wobbled on the news, dipping initially below $1.33 against the dollar but later recovering to rise 0.4 per cent to a session high at $1.3392. The pound fell against the dollar and the euro ahead of fourth-quarter economic growth figures due to be released on Friday.Sterling dropped 0.4 per cent to $1.5780 and was 0.8 per cent lower against the euro at €1.1806.The Australian dollar continued to fall against the US dollar after figures earlier in the week showed that inflation rose by less than expected in the fourth quarter of last year, raising expectations the Reserve Bank of Australia could cut interest rates again next month.

566;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-01-22T10:35:38Z;UK deficit higher than expected;;Britain was forced to borrow more than expected last month to plug the gap between spending and revenues as the government struggled to improve the public finances at a time of economic malaise.The budget deficit was £15.4bn in December, more than the £14.8bn in the same month a year ago and a touch higher than City economists were expecting.The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think tank, said if the trends in spending and revenue were to continue for the final three months of the financial year, annual borrowing would overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility’s December forecast by about £3bn.“Government borrowing appears on course to be higher than planned for the current year, as austerity measures have failed to reduce government spending and weak economic growth has resulted in disappointing tax revenues,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, the data company.“The danger is that the data add to the risk of the UK losing its AAA credit rating, a risk that will intensify significantly if Friday’s gross domestic product report shows the UK entering a new downturn.”All three of the main rating agencies have put the UK’s top triple A sovereign credit rating on watch for a potential downgrade and yields on UK government debt have been rising recently, albeit from very low levels.Over the financial year so far, government borrowing is about 20 per cent lower than at the same point a year ago, but this reflects the one-off transfer of the Royal Mail’s pension fund to the government books, which has flattered the figures.After stripping out that effect, public borrowing is about 7 per cent higher than a year ago as the government’s plan to balance the books remains off track. The year-to-date figures looked a little better than last month, thanks to official revisions to previous months’ borrowing figures.Government tax receipts, particularly corporation tax, have not increased this year as much as was forecast by the official fiscal watchdog, though they picked up somewhat in December. Spending has also been rising slightly quicker than expected.The OBR said on Tuesday that borrowing would need to be £6.3bn lower than last year in the final three months of the year if it was to meet the watchdog’s forecast, which it made last month at the time of the chancellor’s Autumn Statement.At that time, George Osborne said he would have to extend austerity measures by an extra two years to 2018 to close the structural current budget deficit. On the forecasts of the official fiscal watchdog, he said he would also miss his target to have public debt falling as a share of output by 2015. Last month, the level of public debt rose to 70.7 per cent of gross domestic product, up from 66 per cent a year earlier.So far in this financial year, central government current receipts are just 0.3 per cent higher than the same period last year, much lower than the OBR’s 3.8 per cent increase forecast for the whole year. While revenues will be boosted in the next few months by the start of the transfer of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing windfall to the Treasury, this leaves revenues lagging behind forecasts.Central government current spending is 2.7 per cent higher so far this year than last year, a touch higher than the OBR’s 2.6 per cent forecast.The Treasury said: “These figures underline what the chancellor said at the Autumn Statement: it’s taking time, but the economy is healing. The deficit has come down by a quarter since 2010 and more than a million private sector jobs have been created.”
567;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-01-16T22:18:01Z;Marketing executives raise budgets;;UK marketing executives cautiously raised their budgets in the last three months of 2012 but they significantly cut their sales promotion spending, reflecting the gloom on the high street.According to the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising’s quarterly Bellwether report, compiled by Markit Economics, 17 per cent of companies reported a rise in advertising spending in the last quarter versus 16 per cent reporting cuts, marking the highest positive reading since the third quarter of 2011.But spending on sales promotions, which includes coupons, discounting and loyalty cards, was the biggest casualty with a net 6.8 per cent of respondents cutting their marketing spending in this area, the sharpest downward revision in 18 months.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and author of the report, said: “Companies remain cautious about raising expenditure on marketing activities due to weaker than expected sales and profits last year, and ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook at home and abroad.”Internet advertising attracted the biggest gains, with a positive net 5.6 per cent of marketing executives saying they had increased their online marketing spending over the final quarter of 2012.Earlier this week, Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP predicted strong growth in digital advertising spending this year. The chief executive of the world’s largest advertising group by revenues predicted spending on digital advertising in the UK would climb 12 per cent in 2013. WPP has predicted that press advertising will decline 9 per cent over the year.

We place a certain degree of faith in this index and are unwilling to dismiss it until we see official evidence to the contrary.”The Office for National Statistics releases its first estimate of output for the final quarter of 2012 on January 25.The poor figure for services PMI follows Thursday’s worse than forecast construction PMI for December. However, the reading for manufacturing, released on Wednesday, beat expectations.The December PMI for the entire UK economy registered 49.9.Services, which account for more than three-quarters of UK economic activity, are showing signs of poor performance in the months ahead: the PMI reading for new business orders has fallen to its lowest level for two years. If economic output contracted in both the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of this year, then the UK would enter a triple-dip recession.In the eurozone, services activity continued to shrink in December, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months, according to the final estimate of PMI for the region. The PMI reading for the bloc registered 47.8, in line with the “flash” early estimate and analysts’ expectations.A survey of US managers in the construction and services sectors indicated activity in the world’s largest economy expanded at its fastest pace in ten months in December. The non-manufacturing ISM, compiled by the Institute of Supply Management, registered 56.1 in December, beating economists’ forecasts.Separately, official data from the Bank of England on Friday gave little indication that lending recovered in November, despite an upbeat survey of lenders published on Thursday.The signals from the data were mixed: the number of mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to the highest since January, while net lending to consumers increased by about £100m.However, net mortgage lending contracted after two months of growth. In addition, the annual rate at which business lending was contracting steepened to 4.1 per cent.Michael Saunders, of Citi, pointed out that, overall, net lending to households and businesses fell 0.4 per cent from a year earlier, on the definition used by the Funding for Lending scheme, the government’s flagship initiative to increase the flow of credit to the economy.“It is unclear if the problem is other restrictions on credit availability . . . or lack of credit demand, or both,” Mr Saunders said. “But, so far, the impact of the FLS on credit growth seems to be about as limited as similar schemes used by the Bank of Japan over the last 15 years.”Thursday’s survey of lenders suggested the FLS would spur more lending in the next three months.Chris Crowe, an economist at Barclays Capital, noted that households’ money holdings increased 5.2 per cent in the year to November, the first time the annual growth rate has surpassed 5 per cent since 2008.“We would attribute stronger household cash holdings to precautionary savings motives, reflecting the uncertain economic climate, as well as to younger households accumulating the larger deposits now required for first home purchases,” he said.
569;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-01-02T16:56:58Z;Manufacturing activity at 15-month high;;Manufacturing activity soared in December to its highest level in more than a year, according to a poll of the industry’s purchasing managers, soothing fears that the UK economy shrank in the final quarter of 2012.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturers, compiled by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, hit a 15-month high of 51.4 last month, beating market expectations. A reading of above 50 signals an expansion in activity.Last month was the first time since March 2012 that a reading above 50 was recorded. December’s figure was the highest since September 2011.The reading for orders of new work also increased for the second month in a row, though export orders continued to fall.Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, said: “The domestic market remained the main spur for growth of production and new orders in December, although there are signs that global trade flows are stabilising as China and the US strengthen and the downturn in the eurozone eases.”Official data for October, the first month of the final quarter, showed a slump in manufacturing output, which makes up just more than a 10th of the economy. But the PMI readings for November and December have been far more upbeat.“It is difficult to read across what today’s manufacturing PMI means for GDP growth since the sector is worth only a small portion of total output,” said George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.“But a similar move in the services and construction reports would indicate underlying growth moving back into positive territory again in the first quarter of the year.”The December PMI for the services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP, is out on Friday. The index of purchasing managers in the construction industry is released on Thursday.
570;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-01-02T15:17:05Z;Brazil manufacturing 2012: out with a bang;;"PMI Wednesday rolls on and has reached Brazil, where the HSBC / Markit index was 51.1 in December, lower than November’s 52.2 but still comfortably inside positive territory. It’s an encouraging end to 2012 after a dismal performance for the wider economy, where growth is expected to be less than 1 per cent for the year.Few people expect this year to be as bad as last for Brazil, so it should be no surprise that purchasing managers have been getting busy in expectation of rising demand – GDP growth will be 3.3 per cent in 2013, according to the central bank’s weekly survey of market economists.Nevertheless, it’s good to see manufacturing industry taking a positive view on the year ahead. Brazil’s government has been taking steps that businesses have long called for, by privatising some airports, for example, and cutting electricity charges across the economy.Industrialists will be keen to see more progress, such as reform of Brazil’s burdensome tax and labour regimes. But they had best not wait standing up.Related reading:

The index, which is compiled monthly from data supplied by purchasing managers at 400 Turkish companies, rose for a fourth successive month.Those responding reported business conditions as being the best since October 2011 with both the rate of output growth and corporate purchasing activity at their highest rates since October 2011, and workforce numbers showing their sharpest rise in 12 months.Companies reporting increased purchasing linked them to higher levels of incoming new orders driven mainly by increased domestic demand, the report explained. The PMI report also indicated Turkish firms reporting a slight increase in export orders, after a decline in November.Average prices charged by Turkish manufacturers rose for the fourth successive month on the back of input price inflation reflecting both increased raw material prices and unfavorable exchange rates.This from Melis Metiner, an economist at HSBC.Turkey’s manufacturing PMI reached a 14-month high in December, as output, new orders and new export orders all rose at a notably faster pace when compared to a month ago. As demand picked up, firms added workers.Related reading

572;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Eurozone manufacturing weakness continues;;"Europe’s manufacturing sector entered 2013 in mostly downbeat fashion as new data revealed there had been no significant easing in the weak level of output and orders.A eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index compiled by Markit fell in December to 46.1 from 46.2 in the previous month, a steeper decline than the initial estimate of 46.3 published on December 14. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.The eurozone debt crisis has hurt business confidence in the single-currency bloc, making companies reluctant to invest in new capacity or jobs. These problems have been compounded by falling demand in key export markets such as China and worries over tax and spending negotiations in the US. As a result, the eurozone economy is expected to have contracted for a third successive quarter in the final three months of 2012.“The eurozone manufacturing sector remained entrenched in a steep downturn at the end of the year,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said. “The region’s recession therefore looks likely to have deepened, possibly quite significantly, in the final quarter.“Manufacturers look to be in for another tough year in 2013, though prospects have brightened a little, as producers should benefit from signs of stronger demand in key export markets such as the US and China,"" he said.In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, manufacturing activity contracted for the tenth consecutive month, according to a PMI index which declined in December to 46.0 from 46.8 in the prior month.Angela Merkel, German chancellor, warned in a new year address that the crisis was “far from over”.“The reforms we have agreed to are beginning to take effect. But we still need a lot of patience,” she said.Peter Loescher, chief executive of Siemens, the country’s biggest manufacturer, said he expected headwinds and waning economic growth in 2013, according to an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.Manufacturing conditions in France also contracted for a tenth month as a similar PMI survey recorded a reading of 44.6, a fraction better than the prior month.In Spain, business conditions worsened for the 20th consecutive month. Its PMI indicator dropped to 44.6 per cent from 45.3 per cent in November. Ireland, which has implemented structural reforms to help drive an export-led recovery, was the only member of the 17-country currency bloc to register growth in its manufacturing sector with a reading of 51.4. Still, this was down from 52.4 in the prior month.The one exception to the continent’s gloomy picture was the UK, where factory output in December strongly beat forecasts and grew at its fastest pace since September 2011. The Markit index rose to a 15-month high of 51.4 from an upwardly revised 49.2 in November."
573;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
574;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2013-01-02T09:12:16Z;Asian PMIs: happy new year?;;"January 2 is purchasing managers’ index day at Markit, the research company that produces HSBC’s monthly surveys of manufacturing sentiment. Five Asian PMIs were published on Wednesday. The results are a mixed bag but those of a sunny disposition can certainly find cause for a spot of new year optimism – especially for those countries best placed to take advantage of China’s seasonally cheerful outlook.South Korea sneaked back above the 50-point line that separates contraction from expansion, but only to 50.1 in December. It reflects the cautiously positive picture portrayed by the country’s December export figures, released on Monday. This from Ronald Man, Asia economist at HSBC:The first improvement in Korean manufacturing conditions since May indicates that Korea is poised for a recovery next year… We believe the upward momentum can be sustained at a gradual, but meaningful, pace on the back of stronger external demand.South Korea has suffered from falling demand in Europe and elsewhere. In this case, for “external”, read “Chinese”.Taiwan, too, was back above the 50 line in December, also for the first time since May, at 50.6. No need to read between the lines here. This from Donna Kwok, another HSBC Asia economist:China’s recovery and firm US demand pushed Taiwan’s manufacturing sector back into expansion for the first time since May… However, with the external outlook still challenging… we expect monetary conditions to stay accommodative into early 2013.Less reason to be cheerful for Vietnam, which scraped into positive territory in November – for the first time in more than a year – only to sink below the line again in December at 49.3. Trinh Nguyen, another Asia economist at HSBC, says Vietnam must put its own house in order and not wait for China or others to come to its rescue:… the economic recovery process is still in its fragile state as external demand remains weak and consumer confidence is subdued… A third expansion of employment shows the resilience of the economy. Still, while things will likely improve marginally [in 2013], significant changes to consumption behaviour are not expected unless meaningful reforms take place.Indonesia enjoyed its seventh straight month in positive territory in December. The fact that its rate of improvement has slowed (December’s reading, at 50.7, was the lowest in three months) didn’t do much to dent its prospects. This from Su Sian Lim, Asean Economist at HSBC:Manufacturing activity has been expanding now for seven straight months, and, in a positive indication of demand from Asian, European and African markets, new export orders have risen for three consecutive months. The increase in backlogs of work suggests that the sector will continue to be kept busy in the coming months.India has been above the 50-point line for about three and a half years, so December’s reading of 54.7 stands out less in comparison with its recent performance than it does with those of countries further east. Although trending below recent levels, it was an improvement on October and November. And despite the waywardness of India’s political leaders, the manufacturing sector is on something of a roll. Here is Leif Eskesen, HSBC’s chief economist for India & Asean:Activity in the manufacturing sector picked up again led by faster output growth and a further uptick in new orders, which led to a faster increase in backlogs of work as companies struggled to keep up with demand. Moreover, final goods inventories’ depletion continued, which suggests that output growth is likely to hold up in coming months. Inflation only eased marginally and survey respondents noted price pressures from rising raw material costs, firm demand, and the depreciated exchange rate. With growth picking up led by firmer demand, inflation pressures are likely to remain firm in coming months.Related reading:

This lead to a near-stagnation in output growth, and firms cut staff at the fastest rate in over three years.The November reading was 52.2, so to fall to 50.0 is steep: the largest points fall in four years. The index has been above 50 for the past 14 months.With new orders slowing and output broadly flat, manufacturers cut staff for the second month in a row – the first back-to-back fall in employment in the sector for over a year. HSBC said:Moreover, the rate of job shedding was the fastest since August 2009. Goods producers also cut input stocks at the fastest rate since November 2010, as they raised purchasing of new inputs at only a marginal pace.Artem Biryukov, HSBC’s economist for Russia and CIS said in the note:Stabilisation, not stagnation – this is how we interpret the results of December HSBC Russia Manufacturing PMI release. Importantly, over-production was blamed for why factory output was so weak in December. Therefore, producers were adjusting for softer Russian economic growth going forward. Resumption of stronger growth is still on the agenda as we estimate moderate stock levels in the manufacturing sector.Related reading:

576;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-20T16:36:14Z;November retail sales data disappoint;;Retail sales failed to bounce back in November as official data showed consumer spending had provided less of a boost to the economy than analysts had hoped.The Office for National Statistics said on Thursday that the volume of goods bought, excluding fuel, was just 0.1 per cent higher than in October. Spending on retail goods rose by the same amount.Compared with November last year, volumes excluding fuel rose 2 per cent and spending rose 2.7 per cent.“With production and trade data also turning down towards the end of the year, it’s looking very unlikely that the consumer is going to save the economy,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, a data analyst.There was better news from internet sales as average weekly online spending rose 8 per cent to £711m, from £658m last year.“Online shopping has been a phenomenon of recent years. It’s particularly marked this year,” said Nick Bubb, an independent analyst. “Retailers that do well at selling online, like John Lewis, are doing particularly well. But it’s not so easy for independent retailers.”While overall sales volumes have barely changed, online shopping has risen steadily since late 2007. Online goods now make up 10.8 per cent of total volumes, excluding fuel, compared with 4.2 per cent at the end of 2007.The poor official data come as retailers campaign to stay open for longer in a push to boost sales in the run-up to Christmas.Wm Morrison last month urged the government to relax Sunday trading rules to allow retailers to stay open for longer on December 23. Some retailers are opening an hour earlier for browsing and employing extra staff in an attempt to boost sales even if the government maintains its position.“The final festive push is under way, with many retailers extending opening hours to ensure they get every last penny through the door,” said Richard Lowe, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays.The ONS retail index is calculated using data from 5,000 companies that make up about 90 per cent of retail activity in the UK.Food shops and petrol stations have performed particularly badly over the past year, with sales volumes declining.Additional reporting by Andrea Felsted
577;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-19T12:46:22Z;Shoppers unmoved by Christmas spirit;;Shoppers have not been warmed by the Christmas spirit, spending less than usual in the first half of December, according to a poll of retailers.The December distributive trades survey by the CBI, a business lobby organisation, found fewer retailers than analysts had expected reporting sales growth compared with this time last year.“This is particularly worrying news for retailers and it does not do much for overall growth hopes for the fourth quarter,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, a data provider, said: “While these data by no means [signal] a disastrous Christmas for retailers, the renewed weakening of the trend in consumer spending is a sign of how tough the retail environment is at the moment.”Of the 63 retailers polled, a balance of 18 per cent believed sales volumes were low for this time of year.A balance of 19 per cent reported sales growth compared with last year, down from a balance of 33 per cent in November. Analysts had expected a balance of 25 per cent in December.Of the thirteen sectors covered by the poll, only three – grocers, clothes shops and sellers of consumer durables – saw conditions improve over the past month.Retailers selling recreational goods – sports shops, for example – fared particularly badly, with all of the respondents from this sector reporting a year-on-year drop in sales volumes.

579;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-14T08:08:16Z;China: flash PMI number gives hope to manufacturing and markets;;"There are further signs that the recovery in China’s manufacturing sector is taking hold, even if Santa Claus hasn’t been ordering an awful lot from China this year.December’s flash HSBC/Markit China purchasing managers’ index stood at 50.9, a 14-month high and an improvement from November’s 50.5. A sub-index for new orders also rose for the fifth month to 52.7, the highest level since April 2011.Qu Hongbin, HSBC’s chief China economist, was confident that the flash PMI is confirmation that China’s recovery is gaining momentum. (The final PMI figure rarely gets much of a revision). November was only the first month in over a year that the HSBC/Markit PMI showed an expansion (which is when the figure is greater than 50).There have been other early signals that the world’s second largest economy may be on the path of recovery. November industrial output and retail sales both saw their strongest growth since March, for example.But the December flash PMI is also a reminder that the country’s factories have come to increasingly rely on domestic demand for survival. A sub-index on exports remains below 50, which signals a fall in December orders. On Monday, China’s customs department reported a worse-than-expected 2.9 per cent growth in November exports.“[The drop in new export orders] and the downside surprise of November exports growth suggest the persisting external headwinds. This calls for Beijing to keep an accommodative policy stance to counter-balance the external weakness, provided inflation stays benign,” said Qu.Still, the flash PMI appears to have lifted markets on Friday. The Shanghai Composite index was up 4.3 per cent while the Hang Seng China Entreprise Index was up 1.4 per cent, outperforming a 0.6 per cent rise in the broader Hong Kong index.Related reading:

581;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-05T17:11:05Z;PMIs signal eurozone recession bottoming out;;The pace of contraction in the eurozone economy slowed unexpectedly in November, raising hopes that the downturn affecting the 17-country bloc may be bottoming out.The Markit purchasing managers’ compsite index, a survey of business activity in the manufacturing and services sectors across Europe, rose to 46.5 last month, up from 45.7 in October – and significantly higher than an earlier “flash” estimate for the month.Although the latest figure is still below the 50 mark that would signal an end to contraction, a growing number of economists now argue that the worst is over and the economy could turn in the second half of next year. The eurozone fell back into recession in the third quarter for the first time in three years, with gross domestic product contracting 0.1 per cent.“There are signs that the recession may have reached a nadir …at least in terms of the rate of decline,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Positive outcomes could be seen in the data across the board, said Apolline Menut and Francois Cabau at Barclays, but the two London-based economists said they “remain to be convinced” that the trend would continue.The eurozone is expected to remain in recession until at least early 2013, but Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said recently that “the recovery for most of the eurozone will certainly begin in the second half of 2013”.Strong data out of Germany, Europe’s largest economy, and Ireland, which is showing clear signs of resurgence, are fuelling optimism among policymakers and economists.Germany’s composite PMI figure rose to 49.2 in November from 47.7 in October, reflecting slower declines in both manufacturing and services output. Meanwhile, Ireland’s services PMI remained stable at 56.1, as new orders kept growing last month.Improved activity in the private sector, which follows a sharp drop in consumer prices and record high unemployment data, is likely to add pressure on the ECB to cut rates at Thursday’s monetary policy meeting. However, most economists expect the ECB will refrain from doing so before it has first tested its recently designed bond-buying programme, which aims to eliminate speculation about a eurozone break-up.“We expect no rate change, although the decision is unlikely to be unanimous and some governing council members will probably favour a 25 basis points cut,” said Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit.Unemployment edging closer to 12 per cent remains one of the significant drags on economic recovery in the short term, as consumer demand is set to remain subdued. Moreover, southern European countries seem to be struggling to revive their economies, despite debt levels that have fallen sharply in recent months.France, Spain and Italy were the worst performers in Wednesday’s PMI data, as companies in the three southern economies continued to suffer from a sharp decline in demand for their goods and services amid the implementation of severe austerity measures.This led some economists to conclude that the eurozone could enter a phase of no-growth for an indefinite period, similar to that experienced in Japan over the past two decades.“After a severe margin contraction this year, our new proprietary ‘margin lead indicator’ suggests that European margins will be close to flat next year,” said Graham Secker, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
582;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-05T10:50:30Z;Services data suggest recovery ‘fizzled out’;;An influential gauge of activity in the UK’s dominant services sector fell to its lowest level in almost two years in November, amplifying fears that the economy could shrink in the final quarter of 2012.Activity fell to 50.2, its lowest level since December 2010, according to the CIPS/Markit survey of purchasing managers working in the industry. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity.The poor performance of the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of GDP, will be of concern to the government ahead of this afternoon’s Autumn Statement.“The outlook for growth next year is clearly looking shaky and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] will be revising down its economic forecasts fairly significantly alongside the Autumn Statement this afternoon,” said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics, a consultancy.Ms Redwood said the data suggested that the recovery in the biggest part of the UK economy had “completely fizzled out”.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey added “to worrying signs that the economy faces a renewed slide back into contraction”.The poll indicated that activity in the services sector could weaken further in the months ahead, reporting that a tough economic climate had undermined efforts to secure new orders.The weak services PMI comes on the back of renewed signs that activity in the construction sector is contracting. However, the manufacturing PMI for November, released earlier this week, showed signs of a stabilisation in activity.
583;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-12-04T11:19:03Z;Confidence plunges in construction sector;;Confidence in the outlook for the construction sector plunged last month after new orders fell to their lowest level since the first half of 2009.The influential CIPS/Markit poll of purchasing managers fell to 49.3 in November, from 50.9 the previous month. A figure of below 50 signals a contraction in activity. The reading, the lowest since August, was below market expectations of a small rise in activity.The purchasing managers polled frequently cited a lack of new work to replace projects completed in November, with the reading for new orders falling to its lowest level since April 2009.“The survey indicates that the sector is highly likely headed for yet further contraction in the fourth quarter,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, a forecaster. “With the construction sector seemingly headed for further contraction and with the manufacturing sector still struggling despite showing some signs of limited improvement in November, the economy is going to be reliant on clear expansion in the dominant services sector if it is to avoid a renewed GDP dip.”A drop-off in housebuilding and commercial activity was behind the lower levels of activity in November. Residential building activity has fallen during each of the past six months. The fall in activity for the commercial sector was the steepest since the end of 2009. However, activity was buoyed by an increase in civil engineering work, which rose at the fastest pace for seven months.The data cap a bleak year for the sector, which makes up 7 per cent of GDP. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: “A protracted decline in workloads, the double-dip UK recession and shrinking investment spending has made 2012 a year to forget.”Economists and industry groups have expressed scepticism about the PMI construction survey, the results of which have often jarred with official Office for National Statistics data.
584;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK manufacturing outlook remains poor;;Britain’s manufacturing sector has stabilised after several months of deterioration, though the outlook remains poor and factories are still cutting jobs.The key “activity index” from the Markit survey of purchasing managers rose from 47.3 in October to 49.1 in November, higher than economists expected. However, the index was below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the seventh consecutive month.It was hoped manufacturers would be the engine of the UK’s economic recovery, but this year they have been hurt by the stagnant domestic economy and deepening problems in the eurozone.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “Although the sector is stabilising, it is still being battered on two fronts – with depressed domestic demand and weak demand from key markets overseas, particularly Europe and the US.”There was a sharp divergence in the sector: manufacturers of consumer goods reported a very good month but their peers making capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, and intermediate products – manufactured goods that are then used in further manufacturing – struggled.Overall production rose for the first time in five months, according to the survey, but manufacturers said they were working through backlogs of work rather than picking up new orders.They continued to keep a tight hold on costs, by reducing their purchases and cutting jobs for the fourth month in a row.Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said the survey “did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector” and was consistent with manufacturing output falling about 0.5 per cent over the quarter.Input price inflation slowed: companies reported higher prices for chemicals, energy and food ingredients, but lower prices for metals and plastics.
585;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Euro rises after Spain requests bank aid;;The euro hit a six-week high after Spain formally requested aid for its banking sector and Greece announced the terms of its debt buyback deal, prompting a rally in Greek government bonds.The single currency rose more than 0.6 per cent to a session high of $1.3076, its strongest level since October, amid a positive tone on risk across the foreign exchange markets, after an index showed manufacturing activity increased in China in November for the first time since July.Figures showing that manufacturing across the eurozone fell for the 16th month in a row did not have a major impact on the single currency. Markit, which compiled the numbers, said the pace of decline had slowed. In particular, the manufacturing industry in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, contracted at a slower rate in November.Sterling hit a one-month high against the US dollar, rising 0.6 per cent to $1.6115 even as concerns continued that the UK could be at risk of seeing its debt downgraded when the chancellor, George Osborne, gives an update on the UK’s finances as part of his Autumn Statement on Wednesday.The Australian dollar underperformed other risk-related currencies to hit a 10-day low of $1.0390 against the US dollar in response to retail sales that were worse than expected. The poor figures heightened expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia would cut rates by 25 basis points to 3 per cent when it meets on Tuesday.The euro hit a one-month high against the Swiss franc, which suffered its largest intraday move since September on news that Credit Suisse would introduce a charge on certain short-term cash deposits. The euro rose 0.3 per cent to SFr1.2096.The Japanese yen rose against the dollar in what analysts said could be a round of short covering by speculators, who are now holding their largest net short positions on the yen since 2007, according to US Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures.“The scale of short yen positioning highlights the risk of a short squeeze should the BoJ disappoint in terms of shifting to more aggressive easing heading into 2013,” said analysts at the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi.The dollar fell more than 0.2 per cent to Y81.97.
586;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-27T22:22:42Z;Games tourists helped UK out of recession;;Big spending by foreign tourists who came for the Olympics helped boost the British economy in the three months to September.The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday that Britain’s trade position improved between the second and third quarters as imports fell 0.4 per cent and exports rose 1.7 per cent, partly because visitors who came to London for the games spent more than most tourists visiting the UK.Data from the International Passenger Survey show earnings from visitors to the UK were 9 per cent higher when the games took place in August than the same month last year, even though the number of visitors this year was 5 per cent lower.The ONS said the boost from the Olympics helped the economy expand by 1 per cent in the third quarter, as originally estimated.“The robust growth in comparison with the same quarter last year suggests the Olympic and Paralympic Games may have had a positive and significant effect on household spending patterns,” the ONS said.The Olympics effect was difficult to measure, but the games could have increased spending in hotels and restaurants, as well as on travel.Business investment also rose by 3.7 per cent over the summer months, with non-manufacturing investment driving the improvement.The ONS’s unchanged second estimate of gross domestic product suggests the economy really did spring out of its double-dip recession.“The reduction in working days as a result of the diamond jubilee in the second quarter of 2012 and hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the third quarter of 2012 may explain why growth appears so buoyant compared with recent quarters,” the ONS said.But economic data for the current quarter has been less encouraging.“If anything, the details in the new data further highlight the temporary nature of the upturn,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, a data provider.“Payback is likely in the fourth quarter, with the country facing a slide back into contraction.”This month Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, said the economy may contract again and would remain weak for several years.
587;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Record special payouts from US companies;;A record number of US companies have announced special dividends in recent months in order to escape higher taxes on equity income payments.The current tax rate of 15 per cent on dividends, legislated by the Bush tax cuts in 2003, could spike to a top rate of more than 40 per cent next year unless President Barack Obama and Congress can avoid the fiscal cliff, which would trigger automatic tax rises and spending cuts. Mr Obama made raising taxes on the wealthy a central plank of his re-election campaign.The dividends have been promised by companies where management insiders hold a high proportion of the shares. Many US companies are flush with cash but reluctant to invest given the general uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff and global growth prospects.Since the start of the fourth quarter, a record 103 companies have announced they will pay special dividends before the end of the year, according to Markit. The data firm is forecasting that 123 companies will announce special fourth-quarter dividends, compared to the previous average of just 31.“Barring a last minute Congressional extension, it would benefit shareholders if companies declare and pay special dividends prior to the year-end expiration date,” says Virgil Calahong, dividend analyst at Markit.Steve Trager, chief executive of Republic Bancorp, called the uncertainty over tax rates “the tipping point” that led his company to declare a special dividend. “We’ve had a great year – four straight record years – [and] our capital levels are extremely healthy,” he said. “With this timing issue, I am delighted to do it for shareholders and it has been very well received.”Some larger companies, such as Walmart, have also moved up their regular scheduled dividend payout from early January to late December. Almost half of Wal-Mart’s shares are held by the Walton family.SeaDrill, the offshore drilling contractor controlled by Hemen Holding, announced this week that it was bringing forward a fourth-quarter dividend payout to spare its US shareholders from pending changes in the tax code.The previous record for special fourth-quarter dividends was 74 in 2010, when the Bush tax cuts were last at risk of expiring. Markit’s data goes back to 2005. The pace this year picked up after the US elections on November 6, since when announcements have averaged 22 per week. “If taxes are going up, there are compelling reasons for companies to pay out and get cash back to into the hands of shareholders,” says Marc Pado, market strategist at DowBull, an investment advisory firm.Companies choosing to make one-off payments hail from diverse sectors, although larger banks are subject to Federal Reserve stress tests and new capital rules, said Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr. But he added: “In asset-management land …you have special dividends from cash-rich companies like Franklin Resources and Waddell & Reed, who are relatively unencumbered about what they can do with their cashflows.”
588;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-27T17:41:53Z;US fiscal cliff drives special dividends;;It was when politicians began cranking up the rhetoric over the summer – just as the US presidential election campaign was heating up – that Mike Clarke got out his calculator.Mr Clarke is chief executive of Access National, a Virginia-based bank with a market capitalisation of $140m. He and his fellow directors own almost 40 per cent of the company, with another 30 per cent or so in the hands of retail investors. Through the noise of the campaign, one message came through loud and clear: there was a high chance taxes were going up next year.Mr Clarke and the board began to calculate the benefits of paying shareholders a big lump sum this year, when it could be taxed at the current low rates, instead of waiting to pay it as dividends over time, when the federal government would be taking a bigger chunk.“We did the math,” he says. “We work for the shareholders. We do intend to grow our company, we do intend to buy other companies if we can get those in our sights to agree, but taxes are going up on upper-end taxpayers, and that is a lot of our shareholder base. It is no small matter.”Last week, Access National said it would make a one-time payment of $7.2m to its shareholders before the end of the year, boasting that its investors would take home 50 per cent more after tax than if the company had waited until next year.The bank is just one of a record number of US companies, big and small, that have done the same maths and are signing off on special dividends.Propelling the rush is the risk that the current low tax rate of 15 per cent on dividends is an endangered relic from the tax-cutting fervour of the previous decade.While Washington may delay or limit the hit from the fiscal cliff’s $600bn of automatic tax rise and spending cuts by the end of December, investors worry that higher taxes on dividend income are inevitable given the dire long-term budget outlook for the US, and the re-election of President Barack Obama, who made raising taxes on the rich a central plank of his campaign.The Bush tax cuts passed in 2003 lowered the top rate paid on dividends from 38.6 per cent.Now there is a risk that the top rate could hit 39.6 per cent, with an additional 3.8 per cent on top of that to help pay for the new healthcare law.Since October, 103 companies have said they will pay special dividends or make additional payouts, before the end of the year according to Markit.The data firm is forecasting that 123 companies will announce special dividends by the end of this year, well above the average of 31 that usually make such plans in the final quarter.Notably, the pace has picked up since the US election result and focused the attention of investors on the fiscal cliff negotiations.Since the US election, 66 companies have declared special dividends, compared with 37 announcements from the start of October to early November.This is the not the first time in recent years that special dividends have spiked in the fourth quarter.In 2010, there was a similar rush from companies, only for Washington to delay ending the Bush tax cuts.It is a phenomenon that worries James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital.“If I invest in a company for its growth prospects and it pays a special dividend, I have to question why I’m holding it in my portfolio,” he says.Perhaps unsurprisingly, companies under family control or whose board members own large amounts of stock are among those most likely to pay special dividends.“Concentrated ownership at the executive and board level can more expeditiously push for one-time special dividends at the current favourable tax levels,” says Virgil Calahong, dividend analyst at Markit.Among the companies recently making such a move are those with a hefty percentage of insider holdings.The White House and Congressional leaders are embarking on high-stakes talks to avoid a looming fiscal cliffThese include Franklin Resources, with insiders holding 35.42 per cent of the company, Werner Enterprises with insiders at 38.5 per cent, and Knight Transportation, with 27.3 per cent held by insiders.Wynn Resorts has issued a one-time dividend of $750m, with insiders owning 21 per cent of the company, led by Steve Wynn, its chief executive and founder, who holds about a tenth.Other tightly held companies announcing special dividends include Sinclair Broadcast Group, Marine Products Group and Sycamore Networks.One notable example of insider control at a major blue-chip company is Walmart, with the world’s largest retailer moving its dividend payout to December 27 from a previously announced date of January 2.While that action is not a special dividend, the Walton family owns 48 per cent of the company.In the event that higher taxes on dividends become reality, larger companies that have attracted the attention of yield-starved investors in recent years are expected to weigh up the choice of sticking with regular cash payouts or accelerating equity buybacks.“If tax rates rise on dividends, large companies will look at doing more buybacks as a way to return cash to shareholders,” says Marc Pado, a market strategist at Dowbull, which is an investment advisory firm.
589;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-27T10:52:15Z;UK growth hits 1% in third quarter;;Britain’s economy grew 1 per cent between the second and third quarters, as originally estimated, though economists warned recent improvements in household spending and net trade could be shortlived. Separately on Tuesday, the OECD forecast that UK public finances would remain in bad shape next year.The Office for National Statistics’ unchanged second estimate of gross domestic product suggests the economy really did bound out of its double-dip recession at a rapid pace in the third quarter. Extra data about household expenditure and net trade show both recovered strongly, though the ONS said the London Olympics may have boosted those figures.Early economic data from the fourth quarter has been less encouraging, though. This month Sir Mervyn King, outgoing governor of the Bank of England, said the economy may contract again and would in any case remain weak for several years.“If anything, the details in the new data further highlight the temporary nature of the upturn,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit. “Payback is likely in the fourth quarter, with the country facing a slide back into contraction.”Household expenditure rose 0.6 per cent between the second and third quarters, the strongest growth since the second quarter of 2010. It was 0.9 per cent higher than the same period a year ago.“The robust growth in comparison with the same quarter last year suggests that the Olympic and Paralympic Games may have had a positive and significant effect on household spending patterns,” the ONS said.Compensation of employees – which includes wages and social and pension contributions from employers – rose 1.4 per cent, the most since the fourth quarter of 2009.Britain’s trade position also improved as imports fell 0.4 per cent and exports rose 1.7 per cent between the second and third quarters. The large increase in exports was partly down to higher spending by foreign tourists who came for the Olympics, the ONS said.Data from the International Passenger Survey show earnings from visitors to the UK were 9 per cent higher in August than the same month last year, even though the number of visitors was 5 per cent lower.Business investment increased 3.7 per cent between the second and third quarters, the second quarterly increase in a row, with non-manufacturing investment driving the improvement.In spite of the economic improvements in the third quarter, forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for governments’ cyclically adjusted budget deficits showed the UK performing worse than any other member bar Japan.The organisation expected Britain to have a budget deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2013 and of 4.9 per cent the following year.The OECD backed the UK government’s fiscal consolidation, saying that the policy “remains appropriate to ensure the sustainability of the public finances.”In the event of lower than expected growth, the OECD urged the UK to allow so-called automatic stabilisers – higher welfare spending and lower tax revenues – to kick in even though this might imply the government taking longer to hit its debt target.The UK economy was expected to expand 0.9 per cent next year and 1.6 per cent in 2014.
590;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-22T20:03:59Z;China outlook keeps global equities afloatHopes for global recovery buoy equities;;"Encouraging signs from the Chinese economy helped buoy global equity and
commodity prices and offset fresh uncertainty over the outlook for the eurozone.But activity was relatively light given the closure of US markets for Thanksgiving.Hopes that China would avoid a hard landing were boosted by a preliminary November reading on the HSBC-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index of 50.4 – the third increase in a row and the first time since October 2011 it has risen above the 50 threshold that nominally separates contraction from expansion.“The solid improvement adds to recent signs that the slowdown in activity has run its course,” said Nikolaus Keis, economist at UniCredit.“With increasing signs of the Chinese economy gaining some momentum, the need for large-scale additional macro accommodation is diminishing, although we expect some fine-tuning measures by the new political leadership in order to safeguard the recovery.”By contrast, the latest PMI data from the eurozone did little to soothe concerns that the region remained stuck in recession.The composite eurozone PMI edged up from 45.7 to 45.8 as an improvement in the manufacturing index was largely negated by a drop in service sector activity.“All in all, the latest PMI reports point to a sizeable contraction in [gross domestic product] in the euro area in the fourth quarter,” said Nick Stamenkovic, macro strategist at RIA Capital Markets.“We expect euro area activity to stabilise in early 2013, with a recovery under way by spring, but risks are on the downside.”Further gloom came from news that eurozone consumer confidence had tumbled to a 42-month low in November.“The renewed drop in confidence reinforces suspicion that eurozone consumers will be extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, thereby contributing to a likely further fall in GDP,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.Further clues as to how the German economy is being affected by the crisis in the periphery may come on Friday with the release of the Ifo Institute’s November business sentiment index.But the latest economic concerns were offset to some degree by hopes that eurozone finance ministers would finally agree the release of much-needed bailout funds to Greece next Monday.The more optimistic mood helped push the euro higher. The single currency briefly touched $1.29, its highest for a fortnight, and reached a seven-month high versus the yen.A well-received auction of Spanish sovereign debt also helped sentiment towards riskier assets, analysts said.Indeed, the yield on Spain’s 10-year government bond in the secondary market fell another 6 basis points to 5.66 per cent, according to Reuters data.Madrid kicked off its 2013 funding campaign with the auction of €3.88bn of debt, more than the amount it had targeted. In a separate transaction, it sold a further €3.27bn to its pension reserve fund. Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell 6bp to 5.66 per cent, while that on the German Bund held steady at 1.43 per cent.Equity markets made solid progress. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index climbed 0.6 per cent – its fourth successive advance – while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 1.6 per cent to reach its best level for more than six months.The rekindled optimism about China, plus the weaker tone of the dollar, helped fuel gains for base metals prices. Copper rose 0.3 per cent in London to $7,715 a tonne.Among industrial commodities, Brent crude edged back towards the $110-a-barrel level as concerns about supplies from the Middle East were calmed by a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip .Gold, meanwhile, inched up a fraction to $1,730 an ounce."
591;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Eurozone business set for grim quarter;;The eurozone is likely to contract in the final quarter at its fastest pace since 2009, an industry survey said on Thursday, but a stabilisation in still-gloomy manufacturing data offered a glimmer of hope for next year.Business activity in the 17-country bloc contracted in November for the 14th month out of 15 as the manufacturing and service sectors declined in the single currency area.The Markit purchasing managers’ composite index for the eurozone edged higher to 45.8, up from 45.7 in October, but still below the 50 mark that would signal an end to contraction.But an improvement in the manufacturing PMI, to 46.2 from 45.4 in October, was likely to give the European Central Bank pause as it weighed a cut in interest rates, some analysts said.“We expect the [PMI] index has now turned the corner and the euro economy will stop contracting in early 2013,” Christopher Weil at Commerzbank said in a note. “In this case, the ECB is unlikely to lower key interest rates any further.”The view is not universal and the likelihood of a contraction in gross domestic product in Germany, the biggest eurozone economy, and the wider bloc in the fourth quarter might yet prompt a cut in the main rate from 0.75 per cent to 0.50 per cent.However the central bank’s as yet untested bond-buying programme, outright monetary transactions or OMT, which is designed to eliminate speculation about a eurozone break-up, might also serve to keep Mario Draghi, ECB president, and the 21 other members of the governing council from cutting in December.“Mr Draghi continues to give the impression he would prefer to see OMT activated before considering a further cut in the refi [main interest] rate,” Janet Henry, economist at HSBC, said in a note.In the third quarter, the eurozone fell back into recession for the first time in three years, with gross domestic product contracting 0.1 per cent. Markit said its survey data were consistent with a contraction of as much as 0.5 per cent in the final quarter. Most forecasts predict a return to very low growth next year.The eurozone’s services sector, which includes banking and insurance, suffered the worst contraction in more than three years, Markit said. The PMI data painted a bleak outlook, as companies surveyed expect a drop in demand similar to the one experienced in March 2009, the darkest month of the financial crisis.Austerity policies across Europe have severely hit consumer spending: confidence among eurozone consumers hit a 42-month low in November according to a European Commission survey. Lower spending is hitting demand and the PMI data also showed an increase in the pace of job cuts in Germany, where unemployment still remains low compared with the crisis-hit southern eurozone states.Backlogs of orders also fell and companies ran down inventories in the expectation of further weakness, Markit said.“All in all, today’s PMI figures confirm that the eurozone economy remains firmly stuck in recession,” Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said. The ECB’s move to shore up confidence in the euro and an improving global economy was likely to afford the region some respite but “any return to growth next year will probably be slow and gradual”, he added.
592;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-06T10:57:05Z;Output data underline UK economic fragility;;Britain’s economic recovery looks fragile after the release of official data showing the manufacturing sector barely grew between August and September.The figures, which come after a slew of unofficial surveys that also point to tough business conditions, were worse than economists expected and took the shine off Britain’s surprisingly strong return to economic growth in the third quarter of the year.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, a data company, said the data “highlight how the underlying trend in the economy remains far from encouraging”.Manufacturing output rose 0.1 per cent between August and September, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday – less than the 0.3 per cent economists predicted. Overall industrial production dropped 1.7 per cent, reflecting a sudden 20.9 per cent plunge in oil and gas extraction, which the ONS said resulted from later than usual maintenance on rigs in the North Sea.Taking a smoother measure, industrial production rose 0.9 per cent between the second and the third quarters of the year, slightly less than the 1.1 per cent the ONS pencilled in when it estimated the overall economy grew 1 per cent over that period. However, the ONS said this would have a “minimal” effect on its gross domestic product estimate.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has also released its first estimate of GDP for the three months ending in October. The forecaster estimated the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in that period, compared with 1 per cent in the three months ending in September.The data come as the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee prepares to vote on Thursday over whether to call an end to quantitative easing, its bond buying programme aimed at stimulating growth.“We just about stick to the view that the BoE will hold fire on more QE for now, but it may be a desperately tight vote and we do expect to see more stimulus either in December (if the data shows no sign of improvement over the next few weeks) or in the first quarter of 2013,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight.Between August and September, the output of seven manufacturing sub-sectors rose while six fell. The biggest increases came from pharmaceutical manufacturers and makers of transport equipment.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures were “disappointing” but “not a bloodbath”.
593;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-02T12:45:26Z;Dollar hits two-month high;;The dollar hit its highest level in nearly two months following stronger-than-expected figures on the US economy that were watched closely by traders ahead of the presidential election on Tuesday.The euro, pound and Swiss franc all fell against the dollar after monthly non-farm payrolls showed that the US added 171,000 jobs in October, beating predictions of a 125,000 rise. The figures led to a broad-based dollar rally as traders and investors reduced expectations of how much longer the US Federal Reserve would continue to ease monetary policy.The pound fell 0.6 per cent to $1.6033 while the US dollar rose 0.8 per cent against the Swiss franc to SFr0.9403.Currency analysts said the US figures were being viewed as politically charged ahead of the US presidential election next week, with a strong number seen as increasing the chance of an Obama victory. A Republican victory is still being viewed by currency investors as positive for the dollar, however, in part because of Mitt Romney’s dislike of monetary easing.“The data [are] clearly risk positive, although some may argue that [they] hurt Romney’s chances which neutralises some of the risk impact,” said Alan Ruskin, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York.The euro was also struggling with negative data for the eurozone on Friday, as purchasing managers’ index figures from Markit pointed to a further slowdown in the region’s manufacturing sector in October. The rate of contraction for national manufacturing industries also increased last month in Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Greece, with only Ireland’s manufacturing sector expanding.The figures helped the euro to fall below $1.29 against the dollar, losing 0.8 per cent to a session low of $1.2834, its weakest level in three weeks.While most emerging market currencies fell against the US dollar, the Mexican peso was a clear outperformer because of its close trade ties with the US economy as optimism on its health grew.The US dollar fell 0.2 per cent to 12.99 pesos, its lowest level in a week.The Canadian dollar was also one of the few currencies to appreciate against the US dollar because of its trade links with the US, as the dollar fell 0.3 per cent to C$0.9939, a one-week low.The Japanese yen hit its weakest level in more than six months following further easing by the Bank of Japan earlier in the week. The dollar rose 0.6 per cent to Y80.67, as investors bet that the weak economy in Japan increased the likelihood of further action from the BoJ.
594;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-02T11:01:31Z;Construction loses jobs as orders fall;;Britain’s construction companies cut more jobs in October as their new orders fell for the fifth successive month, according to a survey.The UK’s construction sector, a victim of the stagnant housing market and deep cuts to public infrastructure spending, has dragged down economic growth this year, even though it only accounts for about 7 per cent of output.The purchasing managers’ index survey for October indicated a slight improvement in overall construction activity but tough underlying conditions. The key “activity index” rose from 49.5 to 50.9, indicating tepid growth, though the index has been a poor guide this year to official output figures.Companies in the survey reported more work on civil engineering projects but less on housing and commercial activities.In addition, new business has fallen for the longest period since the recession of 2008-09, according to the survey, and staff levels dropped last month at the fastest rate since August 2011. Input price inflation rose, with companies reporting higher fuel and energy costs.“October’s survey indicates an improved trend in UK construction output compared with the declines seen through the summer,” said Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, the company that compiles the PMI surveys.“However, the bigger picture remains bleak given ongoing falls in new orders alongside renewed job cuts across the sector over the month.”In a speech last week, Ben Broadbent, one of the members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, said he thought the “prospects for the construction sector look less unfavourable than they have been for a while,” though he added that “in what is a volatile sector, and an uncertain environment, this is not the same thing as a hard forecast”.
595;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
596;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-11-01T15:57:26Z;Manufacturing activity falls further;;The UK’s manufacturers have suffered another month of falling export orders and declining output, indicating parts of the economy remain vulnerable even though the recession has ended.Growth was better than expected in the third quarter of the year but the October purchasing managers’ index survey suggests the manufacturing sector started the fourth quarter in poor shape.New export orders fell at the second-fastest pace in a year, with some manufacturers reporting lower demand from clients in Asia as well as tough conditions in the eurozone.The PMI survey’s key “manufacturing activity” index fell from 48.1 in September to 47.5 in October, further below the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.Economists said the survey was disappointing but pointed out manufacturing accounts for only about a 10th of the UK economy.“The manufacturing sector is clearly struggling,” said Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics. “But Monday’s survey of the much bigger services sector will be a more important influence on the [Bank of England] Monetary Policy Committee’s decision next week.”After better growth in the third quarter, and indications that some MPC members think quantitative easing is no longer a good way to stimulate the economy, most investors are expecting the MPC to call a halt to its QE programme of gilt-buying next week.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ trade association, said the weak PMI surveys over the past few months felt “consistent with the general mood” she has picked up from EEF members.She said manufacturers were gloomy about exporting to Europe, had mixed experiences with China and were trying to target new markets in Russia, South America, Thailand and the Middle East. The domestic market had been “pretty weak for much of the year” and had not picked up again.There were some positive indications in the survey. Manufacturing of consumer goods bounced back strongly in October, even though intermediate and capital goods continued to decline. In addition, the pace at which companies were laying off workers slowed.However, manufacturers also said their input costs rose sharply for the second successive month, squeezing their profit margins.
597;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-31T12:12:29Z;PMIs: grim reading in Warsaw and Prague;;"As beyondbrics wrote last week, Poland and the Czech Republic are going separate ways as they try to get out of the eurozone crisis: Poland easing the brakes on fiscal policy in an attempt to boost growth, the Czech Republic clinging to austerity like a drowning man clinging to a log.But if Wednesday’s purchasing mangers’ indices published by HSBC and Markit Economics are any guide, the two policies are delivering the same dismal results: the seventh straight month of deteriorating business conditions, with barely a tenth of a decimal point between them.In Poland, as HSBC noted: “The PMI improved fractionally to 47.3, from September’s 38-month low of 47.0, but the latest figure was still the second-lowest in the current sequence of sub-50.0 readings.”In the Czech Republic: “the pace of deterioration signalled by the headline figure gathered further momentum, as the PMI fell from 48.0 to 47.2, the lowest since August 2009.”Try as they might, neither country has been able to do much about the fallout from the eurozone. Poland had its ninth consecutive month of contraction in new orders. This line from HSBC’s press release might cause especial concern in Warsaw:Data signalled that export markets remained a key source of weakness, posting the fastest drop since May and a stronger contraction than that registered for total new work.It prompted this conclusion from Agata Urbanska, HSBC economist for central and eastern Europe:We expect that the increasingly more pronounced economic slowdown will be met with a response from monetary policy. We expect the central bank to start an interest rate cutting cycle in November. The scale of policy easing in this cycle is still an open question as the leading indicators domestically and abroad, among them PMI, still give no indication of the economic slowdown bottoming out in the near future.If that sounds at least like Poland is getting a coherent policy response, the same can’t be said of Urbanska’s summing up of the situation in Prague:The weak economic results put increasing pressure on the government as reflected by disagreement in the ranks of the ruling party and in the delayed 2013 budget vote. Opposition to another round of tax hikes has forced rewriting of the next year’s budget but we do not see any attempts to increase budget deficit target. The shift away from higher VAT tax to cut in spending may prove friendlier to consumer confidence though.The faintest note of optimism at the end there, perhaps. But it’s the Czech Republic that is having the greatest difficulty in getting its policy response together.Related reading:

598;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-28T23:59:48Z;Nearly 5m paid less than living wage;;One in five workers are paid less than the living wage, research by KPMG, the accountancy firm, shows, which equates to almost 5m people.Bar and restaurant, catering and retail staff are among those most affected.In a difficult climate of increasing costs of living, KPMG says the effect is falling hardest on those low-paid workers. More than four in 10 say their finances are worse than a month ago.The living wage is a voluntary rate that some employers, including KPMG, agree to pay staff, designed to enable workers to afford a basic standard of living. The rate is £8.30 an hour in London and £7.20 outside. That compares with the national minimum wage of £6.19 an hour.The study, commissioned from research company Markit, found that since 2001, the living wage campaign had helped more than 10,000 employees and redistributed more than £96m to them.Northern Ireland had the highest proportion of people earning below the living wage at 24 per cent, followed by Wales at 23 per cent. The lowest was in London and the southeast, both at 16 per cent.Bar staff, at 90 per cent, and waiting staff, at 85 per cent, were most likely to be paid less than the living wage, although by number of workers the most affected were sales and retail assistants.Marianne Fallon, KPMG head of corporate affairs, said: “We have found that the improved motivation and performance, and the lower leaver and absentee rate among staff in receipt of a living wage, means that the cost is offset.”
599;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Consumers to curb household spending;;Households look set to curb their spending in the coming months on fears that their financial position will worsen, according to two surveys.The retrenchment in spending has weighed on economic output throughout 2012. The surveys, produced by financial information firm Markit and consumer campaigning group Which?, signal that the trend will continue as the year draws to a close.Markit’s measure of what consumers expect to happen to their finances over the coming 12 months fell to its lowest level so far this year over perceptions that prices will rise and the economic climate worsen. The company’s household finance index plunged to 37.4 in October from 44.3 in September. A reading below 50 signals sentiment has worsened.The Which? survey found that two thirds of consumers were concerned about future tax levels and 60 per cent about public spending cuts. Four in 10 respondents said they planned to spend less on food and about half said they would cut back on spending on holidays, clothes, home improvements and big-ticket items such as televisions and washing machines.Which? also reported that 43 per cent of those polled borrowed money, or took out additional debt in the past month.Rising levels of pessimism about the future come in spite of less immediate pressure on households’ incomes. Inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in the year to September, its lowest level since 2009. But higher energy prices are expected to push up inflation later this year.
600;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Credit derivatives to trade on exchange;;Trading in credit default derivatives is to be offered on an exchange for the first time following a tie-up by IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures bourse, and Markit, the data provider.ICE, which dominates clearing of credit default swaps, said on Tuesday it would licence North American and European corporate CDS indices from UK-based Markit to develop exchange-traded futures and options contracts.CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness.ICE’s move illustrates how exchanges are eyeing new opportunities brought about by wide-ranging reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives market. G20 regulations have mandated that more of the vast $650tn OTC derivatives market be processed through central clearing and that more trades be backed by collateral or insurance. A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults.New US rules related to the G20 mandate that tightened regulation of swap dealers came into effect last Friday. Exchanges like ICE and its rival CME Group have been racing to switch popular OTC products like cleared energy swaps into futures contracts. This is partly because standardised futures contracts require less margin to trade than a bespoke OTC product.Also on Tuesday, ICE said it had completed its transition of cleared OTC energy swaps to futures. The CME has an extension for OTC physical commodity swaps until the end of the year.“It shows that the market response to regulation is product innovation,” said William Rhode, director of head of fixed income research at New York-based Tabb Group, the capital markets consultancy. “I think there will be certain CDS products that will have enough liquidity to trade on exchange. Not all, but certainly some.”Many OTC swaps, such as interest rate swaps, have already been moved through clearing houses as part of the impending regulatory changes, but the CDS market has been relatively untouched. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a derivatives trade body, only about 10 per cent of a market with an adjusted annual average outstanding notional value of $30tn had been centrally cleared last year.European antitrust officials have been investigating the CDS market. Brussels is probing allegations that 16 of the biggest investment banks tried to shut out competitors through their use of Markit to supply information in the CDS market. A second leg of the investigation concerning the European operations of ICE was suspended because of lack of evidence.ICE expects to launch the futures contract in the first quarter of next year. Further details of the contracts, such as their listing location, will be announced at a later date.
601;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-15T11:12:14Z;ICE Link expands forex links with Traiana;;Two of the world’s largest trade processing platforms in the off-exchange derivatives market have agreed to exchange trading information as the derivatives industry races to fulfil regulations that will reshape its market.ICE Link, which confirms trades in credit default swaps, has agreed to interoperate its systems with those of Traiana, whose transaction processing business dominates the foreign exchange market.Their agreement to process over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange contracts via ICE Link brings together technology built up separately to cater for each asset class and highlights how the derivatives industry is forging new infrastructure to comply with reform of the market.G20 regulations have mandated that more of the vast $650tn OTC market be processed through central clearing. A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults.Mandatory clearing is a significant departure for the CDS and forex derivatives sectors, which typically trade bilaterally and by telephone. That has meant the rapid construction of trading infrastructure and hubs that have hitherto not existed.It has spurred the growth in recent years of platforms such as Traiana, owned by interdealer broker ICAP, IntercontinentalExchange’s ICE Link and MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.These platforms sit between institutional investors, derivatives exchanges such as ICE and CME Group, interdealer brokers and swap execution venues such as Bloomberg and TradeWeb, channelling trades to clearing houses and providing the IT connectivity.“We’re very keen that our buyside clients that want to clear OTC foreign exchange derivatives at ICE are able to do so in a very efficient way,” Clive de Ruig, global head of ICE Link, told FT Trading Room.“To do that you need to build a network like ICE Link has in credit, and those networks are not easy to build and take many years. Traiana are the pre-eminent network in forex so for both Traiana and us it made sense.”Foreign exchange and credit default swaps were the second and third-largest products traded on OTC markets in 2011, behind interest rate swaps, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.However, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a derivatives trade body, estimated only about 10 per cent of a market with an adjusted annual average outstanding notional value of $30tn had been centrally cleared.Investors and banks have been keen to back the emergence of third-party hubs rather than add to their IT costs by creating links for trading and clearing for each off-exchange asset class.Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV, recently told FT Trading Room the group would begin a similar hub to make credit lines available to market participants by the end of the year.The ICE Link/Traiana move is the latest in a rapid spurt of development in foreign exchange derivatives.ICE and LCH.Clearnet announced plans to launch forex clearing services in March while Traiana has added EBS and Thomson Reuters, two of the world’s largest venues for trading foreign exchange, to its platform in recent weeks.MarkitSERV has signed a deal with Swift, the Belgian financial messaging group, to deliver forex derivatives to clearing houses.
602;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-08T23:04:30Z;Shift of gears at 40 puts winner in the fast lane;How Lance Uggla gave up a successful trading role in order to set up Markit in a barn;"Lance Uggla is the founder and chief executive of one of the UK’s most successful privately held companies, and yet, unless you work in financial services, you may never have heard of either Mr Uggla or the company he founded.Ten years ago Markit started life with a handful of people working in a barn at the end of Mr Uggla’s Hertfordshire garden; today it employs 2,600 people, many of them paper millionaires. The company ended its last financial year with a market capitalisation of $4.5bn, according to Mr Uggla’s estimates, and 30 per cent of Markit remains in the hands of its employees.Mr Uggla, the overall winner of this year’s Ernst & Young UK Entrepreneur of the Year awards, grew up in Vancouver with “really hard-working parents” and went to Simon Fraser University to study business administration. “British Columbia was where you might think of a career in natural resources or maybe tourism, but certainly not banking,” he says.He won a place at the London School of Economics to do a masters in accounting and finance and his career trajectory seemed set.At not quite 40, Mr Uggla was a successful securities trader in charge of TD Securities’ $20bn European and Asian portfolio.“I had a good job at the time and was enjoying life,” he says. However, he saw an opportunity to build a company providing financial information. “When I told them I wanted to resign I think they thought ‘interesting’. Markets were booming, things were going really well. ‘Are you absolutely crazy?’” he recalls. Nevertheless TD Securities agreed to bankroll Mr Uggla’s barn-based start-up – to the tune of $17m.“When they sold their share, the company had a $2bn market cap. They didn’t do too badly out of it,” says Mr Uggla.While accurate financial information in, for example, the currency market was readily available, the same could not be said for the credit market – loans, bonds and credit derivatives. “The original vision for the company was to become the definitive credit pricing company,” says Mr Uggla, who cites his main competitors as Icap, Thomson Reuters and credit rating agencies.“We felt that our methodologies of processing and cleaning on a daily basis was going to give us a competitive edge,” he says. “And it did.”The business model was based on increasing market transparency by aggregating prices from a wide base of players, some of which were also Markit’s shareholders. It was only as the company grew and became profitable, says Mr Uggla, while “we deepened our relationships with buy and sell-side customers and providers, that I felt we could expand”.Today about 40 per cent of Markit’s revenues are derived from financial information, including “a lot of proprietary information sets – economic indexes”, says Mr Uggla.What the company classifies as its “solutions” business includes building “some of the most active websites in the world, including the financial components of FT.com and the FT’s first iPad app”.Markit is an obvious candidate for an initial public offering, but Mr Uggla is in no rush. While he and his 2,600 employees own 30 per cent of the company, 13 per cent is held by funds and 57 per cent by an undisclosed list of banks.In January 2010, General Atlantic, the equity investment firm, bought 7.5 per cent of Markit for $250m, valuing the company at about $3.3bn at that time. “Providing liquidity for those shareholders is a challenge,” Mr Uggla acknowledges, but “shared ownership creates a whole different energy around the company that is our competitive edge. It allows me to say that even with 2,600 employees, it is a very entrepreneurial company and I feel very entrepreneurial leading it.”Nobody could accuse Mr Uggla of having small ambitions. He wants Markit “to be the best of the largest” financial information companies in the world, to compete with McGraw-Hill, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, CME Group.For all that, he doesn’t underestimate the task ahead. “You have to have a lot of resilience and endurance. You have to be thinking about the long game. Nothing comes easy. Everything you think is going to take one year, takes two years.”"
603;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Jobs figures lift US dollar;;The dollar rose against other major currencies after positive jobs figures improved sentiment on the US economy, marking a sharp contrast with negative data on the eurozone.The dollar index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.2 per cent after figures showed US private sector employers added 162,000 new jobs in September, exceeding analysts’ expectations.Analysts said that economic data in the US was being watched for signs on how much “quantitative easing” the Federal Reserve was likely to do, after the central bank said last month its programme was dependent on the health of the US economy.“The conditions in the US labour market will remain key to shaping the length [of time] QE3 is in operation and hence today’s ADP report is crucial,” said Derek Halpenny, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.The dollar was also supported by haven demand amid negative signs elsewhere in the global economy, with earlier data for the eurozone indicating a further contraction across the services sector. PMI data from Markit showed that the services industry in Germany, France, Spain and Italy was still in decline in September.The euro fell 0.1 per cent to $1.2907 while the pound fell 0.3 per cent to $1.6084. The dollar rose 0.5 per cent against the yen to Y78.56.The Australian dollar continued to fall against the US dollar after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates the previous day to 3.25 per cent and fresh figures showed a decline in exports.Markets moved to price in further rate cuts this year after the RBA warned of a slower growth outlook in the Australian economy in the year ahead.“Continued signs of slowing in Asia, particularly China, and the rapid deterioration in Australia’s trade position do not bode well, in our view,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.The Australian dollar fell 0.5 per cent to $1.0219.In emerging markets, the Polish zloty outperformed its neighbours after Poland’s central bank defied expectations of monetary easing and held rates at 4.75 per cent. The euro fell 0.7 per cent to 4.089 zlotys, its weakest level in more than two weeks.
604;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Manufacturers reflect economic gloom;;Manufacturers’ problems are worsening and companies in other sectors see no end to stagnation, according to two surveys that undermine hopes the economy has started to revive.Respondents to the British Chambers of Commerce quarterly study of more than 7,500 companies, most with fewer than 500 employees, reported flat domestic sales and slowing export growth.“We are bumping along the bottom,” said David Kern, the BCC’s chief economist. “The picture is of general stagnation [and] there is nothing in these results that points to sustained economic recovery.”The BCC survey came after a separate but equally gloomy purchasing managers’ survey of the manufacturing sector, which pointed to falling output and rising input costs.The UK economy is widely expected to emerge from recession in the third quarter of the year as the one-off effects of an extra bank holiday in the second quarter unwind.But the two surveys, which come on top of weak official lending data, suggest underlying conditions remain poor.“Today’s data presented a uniformly weak picture of economic activity and will therefore go some way to dampening hopes that the green shoots of recovery are emerging,” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics.The responses to almost every question in the BCC survey were more negative than they were three months earlier.Companies in the services sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of UK output, said on average their domestic deliveries were flat while their domestic orders declined slightly. However, their export deliveries and orders held up better.Manufacturers experienced a sharper decline in business conditions, though the balance of responses still pointed to some growth.Although manufacturing only accounts for about a tenth of the UK economy, the sector grew strongly last year and helped to power the recovery. However, manufacturing output has faltered as the eurozone crisis has intensified.“They used to be really sparkling but now the picture is mediocre,” Mr Kern said. Companies’ investment and employment intentions were also weaker than three months ago.The separate Markit purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing activity published on Monday fell from 49.6 in August to 48.4 in September, slightly worse than economists expected. Numbers under 50 indicate activity is falling.David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: “While these numbers are weak, the big surprise arguably would be if manufacturing currently were doing anything else but contract. Globally manufacturing is sliding just about everywhere – the PMIs for China and eurozone for example are below 50. Perhaps some comfort can be taken from the fact that UK performance is not actually worse.”Manufacturing output fell at a faster pace last month – the survey’s output index fell from 48.7 to 47.6 – and employment levels fell for the fifth successive month. Companies attributed job losses to tough market conditions, lower production and more spare capacity at their factories.Adding to the pressure, the input price index surged from 48.8 in August to 57.5 in September as higher global commodity prices filtered into manufacturers’ supply chains. Companies reported higher costs for chemicals, energy, food products, metals, oil and plastics. However, inflation in the prices that manufacturers charge for their products remained subdued thanks to weak demand and fierce competition.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey data were consistent with manufacturing output falling at a quarterly rate of more than 1 per cent in September. “At that pace, the sector could dampen economic growth severely and keep the economy in recession,” he said.
605;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US manufacturers defy global gloom;;US manufacturers bucked the global trend last month, expanding even as peers in Asia and Europe continued to suffer the effects of the slowing world economy.The US manufacturing sector expanded in September after three consecutive months of contraction, offering some support to the world’s largest economy as new orders and employment picked up.The recovery was not shared by manufacturers in other large economies, where activity continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace.The JP Morgan global manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, a compilation of manufacturing surveys in countries across the world, was 48.9 in September, slightly higher than August’s three-year low of 48.1, but still below the 50 level that distinguishes contraction from expansion.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles manufacturing surveys, said North America was “somewhat more insulated” from the two main sources of global weakness: the eurozone crisis and the slowdown in China. “Any growth you’ve got at the moment is confined to North America and the non-Asian emerging markets,” he said.The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday its US manufacturing index rose to 51.5, the first gain since May.The breakdown of the August survey was relatively upbeat. The closely watched new orders measure, an indicator of future demand, rose to 52.3 from 47.1, while the production index rose 2.3 points and the employment gauge increased 3.1 points.Export orders rose only 1.5 points, meaning most of the boost was domestic, which analysts said was a reason for caution.In contrast, China’s manufacturing activity stabilised in September but at a weak level that analysts said could prompt the government to do more to support the economy.The sluggish survey all but guaranteed that China’s economy probably slowed again in the third quarter, dragged down by falling private investment and a battered export sector. Chinese growth has already slowed for six successive quarters and is now at risk of dipping below the 7.5 per cent pace that the government set as its target for this year.“The policies implemented so far have failed to arrest a cyclical economic downturn,” said Liu Ligang, an economist with ANZ.It has been nearly three months since the Chinese central bank last cut interest rates and government officials have announced big investment plans but have yet to take concrete steps to ensure that the necessary funding is in place.“Monetary easing and fiscal policy implementation could accelerate following [next month’s Communist party congress], in order to maintain social stability and a stable political transition,” Mr Liu said.The September PMI indicated that the economy, while still sluggish, was at least no longer deteriorating. New orders increased to 49.8 from 48.7 in August. That was partly driven by an increase in the export order sub-index to 48.8 from 46.6, underlining a slight improvement in external demand.There was a similar pattern in the eurozone, where the index rose slightly, but still indicated contracting activity for the 14th successive month.In France the situation worsened dramatically with its PMI seeing one of the biggest one-month falls in the survey’s 14-year history, falling to 42.7 in September from 46.0 in August, hitting its lowest since April 2009.Separate data released on Monday showed the eurozone’s unemployment rate stayed at a record high in August, adding pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates on Thursday in an attempt to ease lending and stimulate business across the debt crisis-hit bloc.
606;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-01T16:33:46Z;US seems to defy climate of contraction;;Greece scored the worst for its manufacturing conditions in September, according to the Markit purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing activity, which was published on Monday.The release of this data marks four years of consecutive contraction in manufacturing production for Greece – aside from a period of brief expansion in August 2009. This deterioration was largely driven by a steep drop in foreign orders and a fall in output, as firms scaled back production in line with a drop of intakes undertaking new work.But Greece is not the only country scoring below 50, which indicates a contraction in manufacturing production. Most of the countries for which data for September is available show a contracting manufacturing sector. The list comprises advanced countries – Japan, the UK and the countries in the eurozone – and emerging states, such as Poland and Taiwan, and it includes economies that performed relatively well during the crisis, Germany and China in particular.For both China and Germany the deterioration of manufacturing conditions is largely because of a drop in orders – with China experiencing the sharpest decline in export orders in 42 months while Germany’s export work has been in contraction since July last year, even if the rate of reduction eased in September compared with the record low it experienced in August.The US has shown a turnround after data released by the Institute for Supply management showed an index rise in manufacturing after three months of consecutive contraction. However, there are doubts whether the positive trend will continue in the the near future for the US, whereas for India, Russia and Turkey, the expansion seems more robust.In India, manufacturing output in September expanded at a faster rate than in August, with its order book rising and new export orders increasing for the first time since June. Rising demand has also helped Turkey, in addition to new business from abroad, after a fall in output in July and August.
607;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK manufacturing activity slows;;Slower global growth and higher commodity costs hurt UK manufacturers last month, according to a survey.The Markit purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing activity fell from 49.6 in August to 48.4 in September, slightly worse than economists expected. Numbers under 50 indicate activity is falling.Although manufacturing only accounts for about a tenth of the UK economy, the sector grew strongly last year and helped to power the recovery. However, manufacturing output has faltered this year as the eurozone crisis has intensified and the domestic economy has weakened.David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: “While these numbers are weak, the big surprise arguably would be if manufacturing currently were doing anything else but contract. Globally manufacturing is sliding just about everywhere – the PMI’s for China and eurozone, for example, are below 50. Perhaps some comfort can be taken from the fact that UK performance is not actually worse.”Manufacturing output fell at a faster pace last month – the survey’s output index fell from 48.7 to 47.6 – and employment levels fell for the fifth successive month. Companies attributed job losses to tough market conditions, lower production and more spare capacity at their factories.Adding to the pressure, the input price index surged from 48.8 in August to 57.5 in September as higher global commodity prices filtered into manufacturers’ supply chains. Companies reported higher costs for chemicals, energy, food products, metals, oil and plastics.However, inflation in the prices manufacturers charge for their products remained subdued thanks to weak demand and fierce competition.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey data were consistent with manufacturing output falling at a quarterly rate of more than 1 per cent in September. “At that pace, the sector could dampen economic growth severely and keep the economy in recession,” he said.However, the EEF, the manufacturers’ trade association, pointed out that new orders were still rising slightly. “As inflation in the UK continues to ease, we could see stronger domestic demand in the final quarter of the year,” it said.
608;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-10-01T06:55:57Z;India PMI: steady as she goes;;"India’s economic performance has remained subdued over the past two months, with manufacturing flat, exports down, and the trade deficit up. Again.The purchasing managers’ index for India stayed steady at 52.8 in September, the same as August, according to HSBC and Markit. Meanwhile, Indian exports fell 9.7 per cent, to $22bn, in August, while imports fell 5.1 per cent, to $38bn, producing a $16bn trade deficit, according to government data.That was marginally better than the 14.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent drops exports and imports experienced, respectively, in July – but it’s hardly good news.“Clearly global demand has begun to impose on our export numbers,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank. “PMI is static, just the way it has been for two months now – but I think the positive takeaways from this has been the move up in new export orders [and a] correction in output prices.”New orders rose marginally – the forty-second straight month of positive growth – and output prices did drop, but they continue to grow faster than the historical average, according to HSBC.In light of the government’s recent reforms rush, the October-December quarter, especially around the demand-boosting Diwali festival, could see India’s economic prospects brighten, Rao said, though further reforms are needed.Leif Eskesen, chief India economist for HSBC, agreed:Global headwinds, the lagged effects of monetary tightening, and slow progress on structural reforms in recent years are holding down manufacturing growth. The pick up in exports orders in September and the recently announced reform measure, however, offer some hope for the future…The progress on policy reform over the past month were positive steps in the right direction. While these measures do not by themselves offer an immediate boost to growth and implementation risks remain, the positive sentiment effect they have delivered can help bring about a gradual recovery in the investment cycle in coming months, especially if further measures are tabled.Related reading:

609;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-09-28T02:57:45Z;Brussels steps up probe into CDS trading;;Brussels is stepping up a probe into allegations that the biggest investment banks are blocking rivals from establishing derivatives trading platforms, raising the spectre of fresh regulatory trouble for the financial sector.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition enforcer, is making a “top priority” of his investigation into whether banks shut out competitors through their use of Markit, which provides financial information in the credit default swap market.Following an 18-month investigation, officials are homing in on concerns that 16 investment banks controlled information to ensure they remained indispensable dealers of CDS, derivative products that insure against default and are traded.Investigators are probing whether they did this by giving most of their raw data exclusively to Markit– rather than opening access to rivals such as Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters – in effect thwarting the development of a rival service.According to senior officials, the lack of transparency may have had an impact on CDS trading.This week Mr Almunia said the probe would “confirm the bad functioning of this market in some respects”.Any evidence of price distortion will be seized upon by European politicians who believe CDS speculation aggravated the eurozone crisis.A second leg of the investigation revolving around ICE Clear Europe, the biggest CDS clearing house, has been suspended because of lack of evidence. The commission had looked at whether the clearer, owned by Intercontinental Exchange of the US, offered nine banks favourable terms.The market changed with the entrance of LCH.Clearnet, one of the largest clearing houses.The decision to make the Markit case a priority, while suspending work on Ice, is a sign that the commission is working towards serving formal charges. If wrongdoing is proved it can impose fines of up to 10 per cent of global revenues.Markit declined to comment.Mr Almunia is also overseeing investigations into alleged collusion by banks to fix Libor and Euribor.The 16 CDS bank dealers are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, RBS, UBS, Wells Fargo, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale. The banks are co-operating with investigators and deny wrongdoing.
610;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-09-24T19:26:27Z;Wall St engineering revival of CDS;;Wall Street financial engineers have devised a new way to combat declining trading in the credit derivatives market – they are revamping an index to add financial instruments that do not exist.Indices that track the price of credit default swaps (CDS), contracts which act as insurance against a default on corporate bond payments, have become a popular way for banks and hedge funds to speculate on the creditworthiness of American companies and for bond fund managers to hedge risks in their portfolio.But underlying CDS trading has shrivelled to such an extent that there are not enough actively traded names to make up a 100-company index.This week, the index provider, Markit, will cross a Rubicon and begin to include three companies in its North American high-yield CDX index for which no bank is offering a CDS.Markit and derivatives traders hope the addition of CIT Group, Charter Communications and Calpine Corp will force banks to launch CDS on the three companies.Global trading in individual corporate CDS is down 23 per cent by volume this year, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.Some people are warning that the illiquidity of the underlying market risks a repeat of debacles such as the JPMorgan “London whale” trades in which the bank lost $5bn on a trade involving a CDX index.Ed Grebeck, chief executive of Tempus Advisors, said that traders would be able to exploit any wide disparities between the underlying CDS prices and the price of the index, while the index itself will become an increasingly imperfect hedge for the credit risks of a bond portfolio.“These indices provide a false sense of comfort,” Mr Grebeck said. “The best way to hedge your credit risk is to manage your credit risk in the first place. This provides users of the index greater opportunity to conduct arbitrage, as opposed to helping institutions to hedge their risks.”The prices of Markit’s CDX indices are set at a daily fixing using quotes provided by dealers, excluding outlier quotes, a process the company says mirrors the one used to calculate Libor – the interbank lending rate that has become the subject of a slew of regulatory inquiries into possible manipulation.Deepak Agnani, head of US credit indices at Markit, said the process for choosing additional names was transparent and conducted in consultation with dealers. “We have picked the three companies that have the highest amount of debt outstanding,” he said. “They are names that should be put in focus by the CDS community.”Barclays strategists led by Brad Rogoff, writing in a recent note to clients, said that they expected the emergence of CDS trading in CIT, Charter and Calpine after the index goes live this Thursday.“The belief is that CDX inclusion will drive single-name CDS trading through index arbitrage, thereby broadening the base of CDS liquidity that has otherwise been shrinking to an ever-smaller group of credits. We concur with this view and are excited about the prospect for enhanced liquidity in high yield derivative markets.”
611;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-09-23T23:36:56Z;Pace of home finance deterioration slows;;Household finances are deteriorating at their slowest pace in more than two years, according to a survey.But retail data suggest that sales are growing at only half the rate they were before the financial crisis hit in 2008.The survey comes before economic data due out this week that is expected to show second-quarter output shrank slightly less than previously calculated and follows recent numbers coming in more upbeat than those earlier this year.Gross domestic product, which was initially reported to have contracted 0.7 per cent in the three months to June and was later revised to a 0.5 per cent decline, is expected to be revised upwards to a 0.4 per cent drop after building data was revised. The second quarter had been considered a bit of a wild card by forecasters because it had unusual holiday patterns and activity marked by bad weather.However, the Markit Household Finance Index, which tracks spending and savings patterns, registered a headline reading of 38.4 in September, only slightly below the 20-month high of 38.9 in August and the best reading in 30 months. A reading below 50 indicates that finances are deteriorating.“September’s survey suggests that the gradual easing of pressure on real incomes so far in 2012 continues to support household finances,” said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit.Among the more encouraging signs from the survey, he said, were that households were no longer drawing on savings as quickly as they had been. Savings in September fell at the slowest pace in the past two years and the latest drop in spending was the least marked since the end of 2010.However, the British Retail Consortium is releasing new data on Monday showing that despite the drop in unemployment, retail sales growth is only half the rate of its 2006 peak when the pace hit 4.8 per cent. Retail sales grew 2 per cent on average in 2011 and have picked up a bit in 2012 to a yearly pace of 2.3 per cent. The BRC is urging the government to do more to aid the retail sector, particularly by freezing business rates in 2013.However, the Markit survey pointed to one reason why sales may be slowing: inflation perceptions in its September survey showed the largest monthly rise since January 2011 when tensions in the Middle East caused oil prices to spike sharply. Inflation perceptions hit a reading of 85.8, with about three-quarters of respondents saying their costs had risen when compared with the previous month.“Higher fuel costs are likely to have sparked the uptick in inflation expectations, possibly alongside industry warnings of greater food prices ahead,” Mr Moore said.
612;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Euro erases nearly all of its QE3 gains;;The euro fell below $1.30 against the dollar, erasing nearly all of its euphoric gains following the Federal Reserve’s decision to ease monetary policy further amid concerns over both European and global economic growth.Currencies associated with risk appetite fell across the board in response to signs of further economic slowdown in China with an HSBC flash PMI index showing that China’s manufacturing industry was still in decline this month.The dollar index rose 0.6 per cent to hit its strongest level since the Fed took action last week.The Japanese yen strengthened further on risk aversion after figures showed that exports fell almost 6 per cent in August from the previous year, highlighting the struggling Japanese economy.The dollar hit a low of Y78.04 against the yen, continuing to erase gains after the Bank of Japan added to its monetary easing programme the previous day, though it was later flat at Y78.34.The euro dipped nearly 1 per cent to hit a one-week low of $1.2919 after flash purchasing managers’ indices from Markit showed that eurozone growth had fallen to its lowest level since June 2009.A successful Spanish bond auction with Spain raising more than expected from investors failed to have a significant impact on the euro as analysts warned that the result cast doubt over how soon Spain was likely to request a bailout.“This could reduce the chances of a bailout request ahead of the all-important EU summit on October 18,” said analysts at Citigroup.The pound gave up earlier gains sustained after UK retail sales rose in August and fell along with broader risk appetite, losing 0.2 per cent against the dollar to $1.6196.Meanwhile, the euro fell 0.1 per cent to SFr1.2090 in what analysts warned was a sign of investor attitudes towards the eurozone.“The current moves in the euro-franc are a good indicator of the perception of the eurozone crisis,” said analysts at Commerzbank.“When the crisis eased the euro-franc experienced something of a revival. Now that concerns (about Spain) are rising, the pair is heading south again.”
613;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Inflation eases to 2.5% in August;;The UK’s annual inflation rate slowed slightly last month in spite of rising petrol prices, official statistics show.Inflation measured by the consumer price index dropped from 2.6 per cent in July to 2.5 per cent in August, in line with economists’ expectations.Inflation in the UK has fallen rapidly from its peak of 5.2 per cent last September but its decline stopped unexpectedly over the summer as global commodity prices started to rise.David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said the data would ease fears that inflation was set to accelerate again.“While it is certainly the case that compared to a few months ago the near-term outlook for inflation is firmer, most of that firming looks to be coming from higher energy and food prices,” he said.“Core inflation is back at 2.1 per cent, the level it was at in June, and there is little reason to see underlying inflation as anything but contained.”The slight fall in the inflation rate was driven by smaller price rises than last year for furniture, carpets and other household goods. Gas and electricity bills also rose at a slower rate than a year ago.However, petrol prices rose 3.5p per litre between July and August compared with a rise of 0.9p per litre in the same period last year.Inflation measured by the alternative retail price index, which takes into account a measure of housing costs, fell from 3.2 per cent in July to 2.9 per cent in August.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, a data provider, noted inflation was still running ahead of wage growth of about 1.5 per cent, eroding people’s real incomes.“That squeeze is nothing like as severe as the 3 per cent-plus rate at which real incomes were falling throughout much of last year, reflecting the steep drop in inflation from its 5.2 per cent peak last September,” he said.It nevertheless “still represents a fall in spending power and hit to real living standards which will dampen consumer spending and limit the economy’s potential for recovery if it persists”.
614;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-09-10T18:40:29Z;Markit looks at web-based one-stop shop;;In 1982, a former Salomon Brothers trader named Mike Bloomberg set out to provide transparent data on the opaque US government bond market. Nineteen years later, Lance Uggla, former vice-chairman of TD Securities, did something similar when he set up Markit to provide reliable valuation data for credit default swaps.Bloomberg grew to challenge established rivals such as Thomson Reuters and Dow Jones not just because of its terminals’ data, but because of its private messaging system, which created a tight community of financial market members.Now Mr Uggla is examining how Markit might create a community of its own – but using a free online service rather than expensive terminals.Markit currently occupies a highly competitive tier of the financial data market behind Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, the closely matched industry leaders whose terminals are found in most trading rooms, banks and hedge fund offices.Without such terminals, Markit will have to make a virtue of its online distribution strategy, Mr Uggla explains.“We have one chance and that’s the web,” he says in an interview in Markit’s London headquarters, where rooms are named after mountains such as K2.“We are not far enough along for me to want to go into the detail,” he cautions. “But in terms of the vision, I definitely don’t think there’s room for another financial services desktop like a Bloomberg, a Thomson Reuters or a FactSet that people would pay for. If you want to compete, you need to build a community around a free web-based service.”Financial information accounts for about 40 per cent of Markit’s revenues – which the private company does not disclose – with the rest coming from the processing of over-the-counter derivatives trades, as well as risk management and data management services.A free web-based platform risks undermining Markit’s traditional data revenues, but Mr Uggla says the model could include “a lot of opportunity for upsell” to paid-for products.“I would describe our vision as a financial iTunes of sorts,” he says, in reference to the store where Apple sells its own applications and those from independent developers.Mr Uggla predicts that an efficient one-stop shop for accessing equity prices, media content, ratings and research – from exchanges, news organisations, journals, credit rating agencies and analysts – would be welcomed “with open arms” by market participants.“Just putting Markit credit spreads on the web would not be that interesting,” he says. But with others’ content, “it starts to get interesting.” Markit has already begun looking for potential partners, he adds.Such a product would address the front office of financial institutions but Mr Uggla’s plans extend beyond that. Its MarkitSERV business, which provides back office services, will launch a credit hub this year aimed at giving market participants confidence that their trades will be accepted.Information providers, using the web-based community Mr Uggla envisages, would pay Markit a fee for sales that they make through the platform. However, he acknowledges that both Markit and its partners would first have to invest in free content and services “so that a viral community can take off”.Markit has not decided how such a service would be branded, but it owns the Hub.com web address, where its Markit Hub site aggregates premium financial information from 23 content providers.Despite the potential rivalry with Bloomberg, which distributes a product called Markit Securities Finance, Mr Uggla said he hoped to expand his company’s partnership with the market leader.The web-based community Mr Uggla is considering would take another 12-24 months to develop, he estimates. People close to the acquisitive company add that any change to its private status, such as an initial public offering, also looks unlikely in the next year or two.Private trading in Markit shares valued the company earlier this year at $4.5bn. Banks own 58 per cent, employees hold 30 per cent and funds 12 per cent. That may not change soon, but Mr Uggla says: “Over time, given the size and scope of Markit, we will need to create additional liquidity for our shareholders.”Additional reporting by Philip Stafford
615;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Europe subprime assets show signs of life;;The market for a complex financial product that was at the heart of the financial crisis is showing signs of revival in Europe with yield-hungry investors increasingly willing to take on the credit risk of subprime mortgage borrowers.Already this year, investors have bought up three offerings of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities – debt backed by home loans to borrowers with patchy credit history – a reversal of fortunes for a market that was effectively closed for four years.Record low yields on “safe” assets such as German and UK government debt have tempted some investors back into products deemed riskier in search of returns.Amid that increased investor demand, the yield on highly rated UK subprime RMBS over Libor, a measure of the premium lenders have to pay investors to hold the securities, has nearly halved from 4.7 percentage points to 2.4 percentage points since the start of the year, according to data from Markit.“The fall in spreads could mean that investor-placed nonconforming [subprime] RMBS issuance is once again becoming economically viable as a funding tool,” said Andrew South, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s.The three issues have raised about £500m this year, according to data from Concept ABS, a European industry tracker.UK lenders have been to the fore. The Kensington Group, a UK specialist lender that was taken over during the financial crisis after extending substantial loans to subprime borrowers, is looking to tap the markets for a further £150m before the end of the month, having raised £201m already this year.Although volumes remain small compared with pre-crisis levels, they represent a notable revival for a market that across Europe saw only two issuances to investors during a period of almost four years from early 2008.The lack of demand from investors has meant lenders have been forced to retain subprime loans on their balance sheets. The option of selling loans to investors could encourage some institutions to step up lending.“To the extent that the funding costs of nonconforming lenders is reduced, it may become economic for those lenders to extend mortgages at a lower interest rate, which could revive lending volumes in the sector,” Mr South said.The subprime RMBS market in the US is also showing some signs of reviving – the $1.4bn in issuance to investors so far this year is narrowly the highest since the financial crisis, although only two deals have been placed with investors, according to Asset-Backed Alert, a US data provider.So far this year, investors have only bought into senior tranches of subprime RMBS. Those tranches have some protection against defaults because cash flow from the underlying mortgages is used to make interest payments to senior tranches before junior tranches.
616;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
617;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Services sector shows unexpected growth;;A measure of the services sector has provided some good news on the UK economy by showing unexpected growth in August.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index for the services sector, which makes up 77 per cent of the UK economy, registered its highest reading for five months in August. The figure of 53.7, up from 51 in July, far exceeded analysts’ expectations. A figure above 50 indicates an increase in activity.Purchasing managers attributed the better reading to new contract wins, better marketing and, in some cases, better weather. Businesses also received more new orders. staffing levels also rose for a ninth month in a row, although at a slower pace.The news emerged a day earlier than expected after it was inadvertently published by Reuters.The PMI came after the equivalent index for manufacturing activity, released on Monday, also beat analysts’ forecasts, although it still indicated a contraction in activity.The release of the PMIs, which the Bank of England watches closely, precedes a vote by the Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday and will cement expectations that policy makers will resist voting for more quantitative easing or cuts to bank rates in coming months.“For the MPC these better readings seal the deal on unchanged policy at the September meeting,” said David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas. “The committee can afford to leave the existing extension of asset purchases to run its course until November before deciding what further loosening in policy is warranted.”The August PMI for the building industry, released on Tuesday morning, was weaker than forecast, registering a contraction in activity for the first time since June. Building accounts for under 7 per cent of total economic output.“With the services sector upturn accompanied by a marked easing in the manufacturing sector downturn, the survey data adds to hopes that the economy will pull out of recession following the 0.5 per cent contraction seen in the second quarter,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “The wild card remains construction, which could subdue any recovery in the wider economy.”Alan Clarke, a director at Scotia Bank, warned against reading too much into the August figure for services PMI but said the rise in sentiment was justified given the easing in financial market tensions. “Domestic fundamentals are accommodative, so these surveys should be stronger, Mr Clarke said.Purchasing managers’ views on the effect of the Olympics were mixed. Some believed the games had boosted activity but others said the disruption to travel within the capital had impaired growth.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “It may well be that this was partly a bounce after services activity was particularly soft in June and July when it was first held back by the public holidays and then by particularly bad weather. It is also very possible that activity was lifted by the Olympic Games.”
618;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Construction activity contracts in August;;Construction activity in Britain contracted in August and the outlook for the sector looks bleak, with new orders falling to their lowest level for more than three years, according to an industry survey released on Tuesday.The Markit/CIPS index of purchasing managers in the construction industry, which accounts 6.8 per cent gross domestic product, fell below the crucial 50 mark to 49 for the first time since June. A reading below 50 signals a contraction. Analysts had expected construction activity to be flat.George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank, said: “Excluding June, when the index fell because of the weather and the extra bank holiday, this is the weakest reading since early 2010.”Residential building continued to be the worst-performing area and the amount of civil engineering work, which includes some public sector projects, shrank for the third successive month.Activity in the commercial sector, which has propped up the industry in recent months, also contracted in August for the first time since February 2010. New orders fell to their lowest level since April 2009.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “Both the decline in commercial activity and the significant drop in new orders are particularly worrying. The commercial sector had previously been propping up the figures and the lack of new contracts suggests things will get worse before they get any better.”Some analysts have expressed scepticism about the construction purchasing managers’ index, which over 2012 has shown an expansion in activity, in contrast with Office for National Statistics data which reported a 10 per cent contraction in the first six months of 2012.According to the August PMI survey, higher input prices have added to pressure on the sector and business expectations are now at their lowest level since last October. Some companies said their concerns over the outlook were affecting hiring decisions, though this had not yet led to a rise in joblessness with the reading for employment in the August survey flat.
619;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-09-03T11:57:12Z;Eurozone manufacturing revised down;;Eurozone manufacturing contracted for the 13th consecutive month in August, as exports in Germany, the bloc’s main engine of growth, fell at the steepest rate in three years, according to a purchasing managers’ index.The Markit manufacturing PMI for the 17-country euro bloc was revised to 45.1 from the initially estimated 45.3. Although above July’s 37-month low of 44, it still remained significantly below the 50 mark, which indicates a contraction.The figures contrasted with more encouraging manufacturing numbers from the UK, also released on Monday, which showed a bounce to 49.5 from 45.2 in July. But Markit, which compiles the data, emphasised a grim underlying picture for the country’s manufacturing sector, while disappointing PMI data from China at the weekend pointed to a more serious downturn than Beijing had been anticipating, economists said.Analysts said although the eurozone’s PMI rate of decline was easing, eurozone gross domestic product was likely to contract in the third quarter, which would mark the euro region’s second recession in three years. GDP for the single-currency area shrank 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.“The broader long-run issue is that the eurozone product and labour markets are unlikely to show any real sustained improvement until regional structural issues are addressed and the broader global backdrop brightens,” said Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit.The eurozone manufacturing decline was led by a sharp drop in new orders, which fell for the 15th consecutive month, and exports, including intra-eurozone, in a clear sign that the sovereign debt crisis afflicting Europe is slowing down the global economy.Germany’s manufacturing PMI rose to 44.7 in August from 43 the previous month, but worsening global economic conditions dragged exports down at the fastest pace since April 2009, indicating that Europe’s largest economy is suffering from the recession in the eurozone periphery.Italy’s manufacturing PMI suffered most, as industrial activity dropped to a 10-month low, down to 43.6 from 44.3 in July, suggesting that the recession in the sector is deepening, according to Markit.Spain, Greece and Ireland – three of the eurozone’s most troubled economies – showed some signs of improvement, as industrial activity rose to 44, 42.1 and 50.9 respectively.Economists said there was little reason to cheer, however, as recent rising unemployment data highlighted how tough austerity measures were taking a toll on economic growth.“Eurozone manufacturers are clearly still finding life extremely difficult amid ongoing very challenging conditions,” said Howard Archer, European economist at Capital Economics. “Domestic demand is being handicapped by tighter fiscal policy in many eurozone countries, limited consumer purchasing power and high and rising unemployment.”Unemployment in the eurozone hit a fresh high in July at 11.3 per cent, as 18m people were jobless, the highest number since the launch of Europe’s monetary union in 1999.Worsening manufacturing conditions, coupled with record unemployment as well as negative growth, will add pressure on the European Central Bank to cut rates at its highly anticipated monetary policy meeting this week, said Mr Archer.
620;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK manufacturing enjoys August bounce;;The activity of Britain’s hard-pressed manufacturers bounced in August, recording a good recovery from July’s miserable score, according to the monthly manufacturing purchasing managers’ index.In August the UK manufacturing PMI rose to 49.5 from 45.2 the previous month, easily beating analysts’ expectations. However, activity is still relatively weak.Manufacturing output, which accounts for about 11 per cent of the economy, has been extremely disappointing over the past four years and was more than 10 per cent off the pre-crisis peak in June. This latest indicator suggests the downturn is not as steep as recent data indicated, although the sector is far from growing rapidly.Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit, the consultancy that produces the UK PMI data, said: “Having followed such marked declines in July, the August readings for production and new orders do little to change the underlying picture of a fragile sector facing enormous headwinds.”Behind the headline indicator of activity, more manufacturers than last month were reporting improvements in most areas – output, new orders and new export orders – to levels that suggested the sector stood still over the summer, an improvement on recent declines.Markit said that manufacturers of consumer goods were significantly more upbeat than those of investment products.More manufacturers also reported they had increased the size of their workforces in August than those saying they had cut headcount, indicating that the strong labour market performance continues.Mark Lee, head of manufacturing at Barclays, said the figures provided a boost to sentiment after a challenging summer. “However, the eurozone crisis continues to cast a shadow over the industry, and until our key European export destinations stabilise, UK manufacturers will find growth hard to come by,” he added.George Buckley of Deutsche Bank said the rebound would remove pressure from the Bank of England to increase the rate of money-printing in its quantitative easing programme this week. “The PMI is not at a level that would suggest the need for extra stimulus by the BoE, which we think will be happy to allow the current QE programme to continue until expiration in November without announcing more purchases or cutting interest rates.”The rise to 49.5 was far ahead of the consensus of City analysts, who had expected a figure close to 46.1. With very little data to inform their predictions, City economists say they expect the economy is likely to record growth of about 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, after three successive quarters of contraction.
621;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Soros boosts Man United’s prospects;;Manchester United, one of the world’s leading sporting brands, has attracted an unlikely new supporter in George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager best-known for “breaking the Bank of England” with his $1bn wager against the pound in 1992.On Monday evening, as the club’s players walked away in defeat after the club’s first league game of the season – at Goodison Park in Liverpool, home to Everton FC – lawyers thousands of miles away at the office of Mr Soros’s $25bn family fund were finalising documents to disclose a big stake in the club.According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Soros Fund Management had acquired more than 3.1m of the club’s ‘A’ shares – equivalent to nearly 8 per cent of the listed shares.Quite what has piqued SFM’s interest in the company remains unclear. A spokesperson for the firm did not respond to a request for comment.Many other hedge funds have taken a negative outlook. According to financial data provider Markit, as of Friday, 8.4 per cent of Manchester United’s shares had been borrowed for shorting.The club has long been a target of interest for hedge funds. A consortium of London-based financiers, including Paul Marshall, founder of hedge fund Marshall Wace and a prominent Manchester United supporter, toyed with a bid to take control of the company from the Glazers in 2010, though nothing came of the discussions.Mr Soros has also flirted with ownership of a football club before. In 2008, following much speculation, the Hungarian-born investor was revealed to have made a takeover bid for Italian Serie A club AS Roma. He was rebuffed by the controlling Sensi family.Having a backer as prominent as Mr Soros – the world’s top hedge fund manager by most measures – may have gone some way to assuaging the blow of Manchester United’s opening day defeat, but perhaps more importantly it may also give the club’s financial prospects a much-needed boost.These are testing times for Manchester United. Since the flotation of 10 per cent of the club in New York on August 10, investors have given the thinly-traded stock short shrift.Shares closed at $13.06 on Monday evening, off just under 7 per cent from the IPO price of $14, and were trading only marginally higher, at $13.19, in afternoon trading on Tuesday.At the time of the flotation, the company’s valuation had already been revised significantly downwards from the $20-a-share bankers said might be reached.The bulk of the club is still held by the Glazer family, who bought it in 2005 for $1.25bn. They control the company through their holdings of ‘B’ shares, which carry 10 times the voting rights of the ‘A’ shares.Transparency surrounding the club’s financials is also wanting. The listing was fast-tracked under the US Jumpstart Our Business Startups – or “Jobs” – Act, which allows for limited financial disclosure and looser accounting standards.The A shares, to boot, pay no dividend and big questions remain over the club’s indebtedness. Half the proceeds of the IPO went into paying off debts.
622;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-08-20T23:05:10Z;Facebook director sells 20m shares;;A major investor in Facebook and one of its earliest backers has sold a majority of his shares in recent days as the stock price has continued its slide to nearly half its May IPO price.Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder and a director at Facebook, sold more than 20m shares last Thursday and Friday at an average price of $20 per share in a transaction worth more than $400m, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr Thiel, who also sold 16m shares at the company’s IPO at $38 a share in May, first invested in the social-network company in 2004 by acquiring about a 10 per cent stake. He still retains about 7m in Facebook shares, according to the filings.Shares in Facebook, which have been under intense selling pressure, hit a fresh low of $18.75 on Monday before closing at $20.01.“For people who like the sector, and for people who like the company – which after all has a billion users – it may very well be that [last] week’s selling just created a buying opportunity,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners.Bearish investors, however, continue to place large short sales in the stock, trades that profit from a decline in the company’s share price.The rise in short positions has been steady since Facebook’s IPO and touched a record high last week. Investors focused on a series of lock-ups expiring that enable insiders to sell stock and maintain downward pressure on the price.Last Thursday, the first of these lock-ups expired, allowing pre-IPO investors to trade 271m shares in the company.Further lock-ups are set to expire in October, November, December and next May, releasing another 1.64bn shares, according to Facebook’s IPO prospectus.Peter Bo Kiaer, equity analyst at Saxo Bank, said: “Facebook is not for the faint hearted right now because the next six to nine months is so important.”Short interest in Facebook was hovering near record levels on Monday with investors having borrowed some 83 per cent of the 80.4m shares available for lending, according to data provider Markit.That means 4.6 per cent of the publicly available shares in the company are now being held by investors betting on a further fall in its share price.The cost of borrowing shares has also continued to rise, making it more expensive to place shorts. “Once more than half the shares in lending programmes get borrowed, people generally charge more to borrow shares because of supply and demand in the market,” said Simon Colvin at Markit.Oliver Pursche, a portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said: “If you don’t own this stock, there’s no reason to go out there in a rush to buy it. The price is getting close to fair value, but I still don’t consider it a bargain.“Having said that, if you are short on Facebook, you may want to start hedging.”Facebook shares have fallen despite the success of other technology public offerings this year. The other 22 IPOs from the sector in 2012 have an average gain of 25 per cent through to the end of last week, according to S&P Capital IQ, a research firm.Facebook shares closed 5 per cent higher at $20.01 in New York.
623;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-08-19T23:02:22Z;Pace of household debt shows signs of slowing;;The deteriorating position of household finances slowed to its lowest rate in 20 months in August, according to a monthly survey, with debt levels apparently stabilising and less pessimism about the future since March 2010.The Household Finance index, compiled by Markit and based on data collected by Ipsos Mori, reached 38.9 in August, up from 37.5 in July and the third consecutive month of improvement. Although the reading indicates that finances are still worsening, the pace at which they are deteriorating is slowing markedly.The Bank of England, in its forecast at the start of this year, had built in an assumption that the high inflation that cramped consumer spending during 2011 would ease and consumption would begin to pick up from the middle of 2012.The latest survey found inflation expectations have hit their lowest levels in six months. “The drop in inflation expectations to a six-month low will also be welcome news for Team ‘MPC’,” said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, who is responsible for compiling the survey. “Especially after the surprise acceleration in consumer prices during July pulled inflation further above target.”The survey, however, highlighted the contrasting fortunes of families whose breadwinner works in the public sector when compared with those in the private sector. While overall, the percentage of those saying they expect the outlook for their finances to improve over the next 12 months rose to 43.5 in August from 43.1 in July, among those working in the public sector, that reading was 38.2. For families dependent on a worker in the private sector, the reading was 47.2, a figure that is moving close to the 50 mark at which the outlook for finances would no longer be falling.However, the “feel good” tone of the survey did not translate into higher spending, Markit found. Although it pointed to the stabilisation of debt levels for the first time since early 2011, households’ willingness to purchase big-ticket items decline.
624;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-08-14T17:13:17Z;Default swaps ease for top US banks;;Default risks at the top four US banks have fallen to multi-month lows as investors signal less concern over the banks’ exposure to the eurozone amid declining credit default swap levels.The average cost investors are paying to buy default protection on debt issued by Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo has now fallen to levels last seen in May ahead of a worsening of the eurozone crisis and a series of expected downgrades by Moody’s on bank ratings.News of a multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan hurt confidence further and helped push the average level of CDS for the four banks above 220 basis points by early June, their high for the year.On Tuesday the average stood at 160bp, or $160,000 a year, to protect $10m of debt over five years.Taken individually, default protection costs for Bank of America and Citigroup at 229bp and 225bp respectively still far exceed those of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo at 120bp and 86bp respectively, according to Markit data.Investors’ growing ease with bank debt has also been highlighted by a sharp drop in yields on bonds sold by financial institutions as issuance has jumped.After a hiatus of several months, Morgan Stanley sold $2bn in a rare 30-year issue last month and JPMorgan came back to markets for the first time since March on Monday, with a sale of $2.5bn in five-year notes.CDS on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also eased recently as investors are betting the European Central Bank may intervene in markets and buy sovereign bonds to prevent benchmark borrowing costs for eurozone countries from rising further.ECB President Mario Draghi helped spark a rally in global markets late July after he said the central bank was “ready to do whatever it takes” to preserve the single currency.
625;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-08-07T23:01:26Z;Olympic effect slows jobs market;;Fewer staff were appointed in July than the month before as companies became more cautious about hiring and many chose to postpone recruitment until after the Olympic Games, a survey said.Recruitment agencies reported a fall in permanent placements with the steepest decline in London, after disruption from the games made this summer a even quieter period than usual for job hunters.However, the rate of decline was slower than in June, which showed the biggest drop in hiring for three years, according to the Report on Jobs produced by Markit and sponsored by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and KPMG.Hiring of temporary staff fell for the eighth month in a row but the decline also slowed from June.Bernard Brown, partner and head of business services at KPMG, said there was still a “high degree of uncertainty” in the jobs market.“The real story of recovery will also probably only start to emerge in the autumn as the true impact of the Olympics begins to emerge,” he said.“Given that the latest data shows that the sharpest drop in permanent placements was registered in London, questions remain around how businesses in the capital will look to grow and expand after the summer lull in activity.”Vacancies continued to rise but at a slower pace. In the private sector, there were “robust improvements in demand” for both permanent and temporary employees but the number of vacancies in the public sector continued to fall.
626;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK service sector growth slows;;The UK’s large services sector only grew slightly last month, according to a survey, as companies cut their prices to try to drum up business from cautious customers.The Markit purchasing managers’ index for the services sector declined slightly from 51.3 to 51, the lowest index reading for a year and a half. Markit says any number above 50 indicates expanding activity in the sector that accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy.Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit, said the survey was “disappointing”.“Although anecdotal evidence suggests that a number of temporary factors remain in play – poor weather in the first half of the month and pre-Olympics disruption were reported in some quarters – companies continued to indicate that underlying demand remains fragile.”The services PMI suggested the service sector remained in much better shape in July than the manufacturing sector, which suffered its worst month in more than three years. Taken together, the PMI surveys of the manufacturing, construction and services sector for July were consistent with a flatlining economy, economists said.George Osborne, the chancellor, on Friday tried to drum up enthusiasm for one part of the service sector at an Olympic trade event on IT. Promoting new investments by Vodafone, Barclays and Gree in East London’s Tech City, he said the UK web economy was projected to grow at a rate of 11 per cent a year between now and 2016 – a growth rate better than the US or China.
627;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Economists dispute UK construction data;;"Economists and industry groups have expressed scepticism about a key construction industry survey which suggested output in the troubled sector held stable in July, despite the scarcity of bank finance and pruning back of government expenditure.The PMI data come just weeks after the Office for National Statistics reported that output in the nation’s construction sector contracted by about 10 per cent in the first six months of the year, accounting for more than half of the overall reduction in production seen in Britain’s economy in the second quarter of 2012.“Construction has been suffering since the end of last year due to the sharp cuts in public sector capital investment from government and a very subdued private sector, adversely affected by poor consumer and business investor confidence,” said Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association. The latest PMI numbers, he said, do not square with data from members of his trade body.The government intends to launch a new social housing stimulus in the autumn and to unveil a successor scheme to the private finance initiative, intended to raise more private money into schools, hospitals and other projects.Among ministers’ concerns is that the recession has struck so deeply into the sector that Britain’s capacity to manufacture construction-related goods has been permanently destroyed.For example, data from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills show that UK exports of cement have tailed off to nothing since 2010 – down from some 127,000 tonnes as recently as in 2006. Total cement production for the domestic market was lower in the first quarter of the year than any quarter of 2011 at 1.9m tonnes.Meanwhile, the production of bricks has dropped by two-thirds since 2007, according to the same BIS figures.Moreover, reasons to doubt stability in the sector include the fact that the burst of construction related to the Olympics is over, a significant portion of development is for government-financed projects, and that demand from the private sector is generally linked to the fortunes of commercial and residential property, both of which are still weakening, according to Richard Barwell, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers produced a stronger than expected headline reading of 50.9, just about the level that suggests construction activity is neither expanding nor contracting. However, the survey’s new order subcomponent registered 48.4, slightly better than that the month before but still consistent with an environment where business is falling back. Markit noted that the overall reading is still well below the survey’s long-term average.Blerina Uruci, economist at Barclays Capital, said that the latest PMI reading remained puzzling. “Historically the construction PMI has not been a very accurate tracker of construction output and as such, we would not put too much weight on the survey data,” she said.The construction PMI provides the first glimpse of activity in the third quarter of this year. It points to uneven demand for construction services; housing activity, while better than in June, is still declining, with a reading of 49.6. However, commercial activity appears to be picking up, with a reading of 51.0, up slightly from June.Civil engineering – a category which includes many public sector projects – continues to contract, albeit at a slower pace. But despite recent gloom, the outlook is upbeat, with a reading of 59.9 for that subcomponent, the most optimistic since March 2012."

However, the committee did not provide any new moves.Currency traders were also anticipating action on the eurozone following comments from Mario Draghi, ECB president, the previous week.Many were expecting the ECB to start buying government bonds again, helping the single currency to stay supported at about $1.23 ahead of the Fed meeting, having hit its lowest level in more than two years at $1.2040 the previous week.The pound slid against the dollar for the third trading day in a row, losing 0.7 per cent to $1.5559 after survey data pointed to a sharp decline in UK manufacturing activity.The Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for the UK showed a drop to 45.4 in July, the largest contraction in the sector since May 2009.Earlier in the week, a reiterated warning from Moody’s that the UK’s triple-A status could be at threat also put downward pressure on the pound.Meanwhile, the yen was was down 0.4 per cent at Y78.41 against the dollar and up 0.2 per cent at Y95.90 against the euro.The dollar weakened below Y78 in early trading to touch Y77.91, levels last seen at the start of June when the Bank of Japan was widely believed to have verbally intervened to weaken the yen.“There does not seem to be much scope to the downside for the pair now due to increased verbal interventions,” said analysts at Commerzbank.“We therefore do not recommend entering dollar-yen shorts until the interventions have actually taken place.”

Its shares ended 5.8 per cent lower at £11.60.“The read-across from competitor results suggests that the first half could have been difficult for CRH and that management’s guidance for flat ebitda [year on year] may be optimistic,” said Exane BNP Paribas. “Not only are trends in Europe weak but there is a growing question mark about the pace of growth and margin outlook for Americas Materials in the second half.”Bets against CRH have risen sharply from a low base over the past six weeks.

632;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-25T03:19:48Z;Euro hit by Moody’s eurozone core warning;;The euro fell further on Tuesday after rating agency Moody’s lowered its outlook for triple A-rated Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg from “stable” to “negative”and Spanish borrowing costs continued to tick up.The single currency dropped 0.5 per cent against the dollar to a fresh two-year low of $1.2040, moving closer to the psychologically important $1.20 level.It also lost 0.5 per cent against sterling to £0.7765 as pressure continued to build on the eurozone.Concerns over a potential Greek exit remain elevated as the struggling country will only receive funds in September if it can secure a favourable report after this week’s visit from the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank.Meanwhile, Markit’s flash eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index survey, which registered its sixth straight month of contraction, supported the view that the region as a whole is in the midst of a relatively deep recession.The euro has now lost more than 10 per cent against the dollar since its 2012-high of $1.3486 in late February and nearly 20 per cent since May 2011 when it stood at $1.4939.The dollar index, which measures the strength of the US unit against a basket of currencies, gained 0.3 per cent and has enjoyed contrasting fortunes to the euro. It has climbed 7.6 per cent since its 2012-low on February 29 and more than 15 per cent since May 2011. The euro also fell a further 0.8 per cent against the Japanese yen to Y94.24.Markets are looking at further intervention by Japanese authorities but flash Chinese PMI data, which came in slightly better than expected and buoyed risk appetite, kept the yen in check.Japanese authorities have raised their level of verbal intervention recently but RBC analysts said that while the risk of actual intervention had risen, it was not as elevated as generally perceived.Citi recommended monitoring the renminbi-yen pair for clues to intervention and argued that a level of Rmb12 against the yen might be a trigger – it now stands at Rmb12.2.
633;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-24T09:48:18Z;German private sector woes mount;;Germany’s private sector shrank in July at the fastest rate in more than three years, according to a survey that underscored the spread of the eurozone crisis to the bloc’s strongest economies and cemented the likelihood that the region has slipped into recession.A eurozone index of purchasing managers showed activity across the region’s private sector contracting for a sixth successive month. Markit, compiler of the closely watched survey, said its preliminary data suggested the eurozone downturn “showed no sign of letting up at the start of the third quarter”.The downturn in activity in Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone, was sharper than expected, after the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said on Monday that the country was likely to have grown moderately in the second quarter.Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said Germany was being “increasingly dragged down by the problems elsewhere in the eurozone and slowing global economic activity”.Germany’s relative economic vigour helped the eurozone avoid a fall in gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year. Official data for the second quarter are due next month.The surveys “reinforce suspicion that the eurozone is headed for further clear GDP contraction in the third quarter after a highly probable drop in the second quarter”, Mr Archer said. He said the data suggested the European Central Bank may again have to cut interest rates.This month the ECB made a quarter-point cut in its main policy rate, bringing the rate to a historic low of 0.75 per cent.Evelyn Herrmann, European economist at BNP Paribas, said: “The German economy as a whole turns out to be much less resilient to the contraction and stress elsewhere in the eurozone than survey indicators had suggested over the past year.”French output also fell, although activity in the services sector rose marginally for the first time since March. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said this was likely to be due a post-election “settling down” of business and could prove temporary.Data in the eurozone index “is consistent with GDP falling at a quarterly rate of around 0.6 per cent, which is similar to the rate of decline we expect to see for the second quarter”, Mr Williamson said. “Companies across the region are cutting staff numbers at the fastest rate for two and a half years as the outlook darkens.”The composite eurozone purchasing managers’ index – across manufacturing and services – was unchanged at 46.4, according to preliminary estimates, where a reading below 50 signals a contraction. Germany’s composite PMI fell from 48.1 to 47.3, with manufacturing even weaker at 43.3, markedly worse than analysts had expected.A similar survey announced on Tuesday for China, compiled by HSBC, showed the manufacturing sector was still contracting but at its highest level in five months. HSBC said its China purchasing managers’ index for July was on track to rise from 48.2 last month to 49.5.
634;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;IMF slashes UK growth forecast;;Britain’s economic outlook has deteriorated faster than in any other major advanced economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.The IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2012 to 3.50 per cent on Monday, down slightly from its estimate in April. However, the Fund believes the UK economy’s prospects are now far bleaker than thought a few months ago.The Fund slashed its UK growth forecast for this year to just 0.2 per cent, against the 0.8 per cent it had predicted in the spring. Last summer, the Fund had expected Britain’s economy to expand 2.3 per cent in 2012. The IMF also downgraded its forecast for UK growth next year from 2 per cent to 1.4 per cent.“The IMF was clearly very over-optimistic in relation to the UK economic outlook for much of last year,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “The latest forecasts look realistic, albeit somewhat sobering.”The forecasts are far more downbeat than official estimates. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated in March that output would expand 0.8 per cent this year. Treasury officials said it had taken some time for forecasters – including the IMF – to realise the eurozone crisis was weighing more heavily on the British economy than they initially thought.George Osborne, chancellor, took some comfort in the IMF’s forecast that Britain’s economy would still outpace eurozone output, which is expected to contract 0.3 per cent, but one aide admitted that “it’s tough”. The chancellor has rejected the IMF’s earlier suggestion that Britain should consider a temporary VAT cut to stimulate the economy if the downturn worsens.Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the downgrade was “yet more evidence that the government’s economic plan has failed”.The IMF downgrade came on the day that David Cameron and Nick Clegg attempted to refocus their fractious coalition on growth, announcing a new wave of electrification of Britain’s railways from 2014.The IMF also appeared to endorse further monetary easing as adopted by central banks including the Bank of England, saying that “monetary policy also needs to respond effectively, with further unconventional measures, to a much weaker near-term environment that will dampen price pressures”.In its separate financial stability review, the Fund warned turmoil in the eurozone was causing mounting danger for the global system and that risks to global growth “loom large”.
635;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
636;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Cut back in big brand advertising;;Companies are cutting back on big brand advertising campaigns and focusing on “quick win” sales promotions such as coupons and point of sale discount promotions to win over cash-strapped consumers, a leading industry barometer has found.The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising’s quarterly Bellwether report, compiled by Markit Economics, found a net 4.5 per cent of marketing executives increased their spending on sales promotions in the UK in the second quarter of this year, against a flat reading over the previous three months.The climb bucks a wider trend of falling marketing spending. Over the same period, a net 1.1 per cent of companies said they had reduced their marketing budgets with a net 1.7 per cent cutting main media display advertising, crucial in brand building.“Falling real wages and living costs being hit is a theme in the news at the moment and this is becoming an increasingly important theme for advertisers too,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and author of the report. “Competing on price is an appealing method of winning sales.”He said companies tended to increase brand advertising when times were good but that they had been cutting back as the positive economic impact of stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at the turn of the year had started to wane.The report found a net balance between optimists and pessimists on the business outlook of -17 per cent, well down on a net 1 per cent in the previous quarter.Chris Whitelaw, president of digital marketing agency I Spy, said marketers were looking to results-driven advertising.“With a backdrop of economic uncertainty, marketers are focusing their attention on sales revenue and profit margins,” he said. “A reweighting of spend into directly measurable acquisition-rich channels such as search and internet advertising continues and will be a theme throughout 2012.”Many advertising agencies are forecasting a significant upflift to advertising spending in the third quarter as a result of the Olympics. But some are predicting the positive impact will only be modest.“There is a real sense of Olympics avoidance from a lot of clients who want to get campaigns finished so they can avoid the noise,” said Marc Mendoza, chief executive of media agency MPG. “There is still a lot of availability out there in the outdoor market and in TV and the press.”
637;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-10T18:22:23Z;Trade and output data show improvement;;Official data on manufacturing output and exports in May brought some unexpected good news for the economy, though underlying conditions remained very weak.Most economists said the data – which were volatile and disrupted by one-off factors – did not suggest the economy was springing out of its shallow double-dip recession.Indeed, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think-tank, estimated on Tuesday the economy contracted another 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, which would prolong the recession.David Page, an economist at Lloyds Bank, said that although the underlying trend in industry was hard to read, “With anecdotal evidence pointing to soft global and domestic activity, we remain inclined to believe that this underlying trend is subdued.”Industrial production rose sharply between April and May, confounding expectations that it would fall, and the trade deficit narrowed following a sharp increase in exports.The Office for National Statistics said the industrial production figures should be treated with caution since a bank holiday was moved from May to June for the Queen’s jubilee, creating an extra working day in May.Most economists expect manufacturing and service sector output to fall sharply in June, which had two extra bank holidays.Niesr said that without the jubilee, the economy would probably have grown 0.2 per cent in the second quarter. But it said the big picture was that the economy had been flat for about two years.Last week, the Bank of England said it would buy another £50bn in gilts in a process known as quantitative easing to try to support the stagnant economy in the face of slowing global growth.Production output rose 1 per cent between April and May with manufacturing output up 1.2 per cent. Comparing the past three months to the previous three, industrial production fell 0.3 per cent and manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent.Manufacturing output, which accounts for about 70 per cent of all industrial production, was pushed higher in May by the transport equipment and food and drink industries.Food and drink manufacturers told the ONS that demand had been lifted by the warm weather and the imminent diamond jubilee.However, output declined in five manufacturing subsectors including the pharmaceutical industry, where production dropped 3.9 per cent from April.The trade deficit fell from £4.1bn in April to £2.7bn in May due to a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit from £9.7bn to £8.4bn. The smaller goods deficit reflects a 7.8 per cent rise in exports, which outpaced a small rise in imports.However, the UK monthly trade data are notoriously volatile and prone to revisions.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit said the picture over the past three months together “is one of a worryingly high trade deficit, of a magnitude approaching that seen at the height of the financial crisis in 2008”.
638;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-06T10:23:43Z;Input prices ease manufacturing pressure;;UK manufacturers’ input prices fell in June compared with a year ago as the drop in world commodity prices sharply lowered inflationary pressures along supply chains.Input prices – for materials and fuels they use in their business – were 2.3 per cent lower than in June 2011, the first time there has been annual input price deflation since September 2009.The prices manufacturers’ charge for their goods – factory gate prices – were still higher than a year ago but annual inflation slowed to 2.3 per cent, the lowest since October 2009.These rates reflect the drop in the price of oil and other commodities this year as growth has slowed around the world. While oil has crept up to $100 a barrel since June, Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, a financial information company, said it was not likely to climb further.“Given the fundamental weakness of global economic growth at the moment, it seems likely that oil prices should at least stabilise due to weak demand, and wider commodity prices will likewise show similar softness,” he said.Though producer prices – of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers – take time to filter through into what consumers pay in the shops, economists took the data as a signal that consumer price inflation in the UK would continue to fall. It has already dropped from a peak of 5.2 per cent in September to 2.8 per cent in May.Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said: “Given the relatively long lags involved, this points, on past form, to the potential for core consumer goods inflation to fall into negative territory in mid-2013. So, following a prolonged overshoot of the [Monetary Policy Committee’s] 2 per cent inflation target, it is becoming increasingly likely that we are now heading for an equally elongated period of below target inflation.”On Thursday, the Bank of England said it would inject another £50bn into the economy, saying “increased drag” from the eurozone crisis meant it was more likely than not inflation would fall below the target without more stimulus.
639;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-02T10:42:48Z;Eurozone unemployment hits record high;;The European Central Bank is widely expected to make an interest rate cut this week to try to invigorate the eurozone’s ailing economy after unemployment in the region climbed to a record high of 11.1 per cent and a key survey of manufacturing showed the sector to be at its weakest in three years.Attention is back on the ECB’s role in helping the eurozone emerge from its debt crisis, after last week’s EU summit agreed that the central bank should play a role in common bank supervision. Leaders also backed the view of Mario Draghi, ECB president, that eurozone bailout funds should be offered directly to recapitalise struggling banks.Few analysts expect the ECB to offer politicians a quid pro quo this week by giving further direct support to banks or governments such as more cheap loans or bond buying. But markets are pricing in the likelihood that the ECB will respond to worsening economic data by cutting its main policy rate to below 1 per cent for the first time – a step that should help peripheral eurozone banks that rely on central bank borrowing.“A rate cut by 25bp almost looks like a done deal,” said Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING in Brussels, in research published on Monday.Mr Draghi has voiced alarm at increased risks to the economic outlook and some economists think the central bank could consider a more aggressive rate cut of 50 basis points.“Circumstances are sufficiently negative to move to 0.5 per cent,” said Julian Callow, European economist at Barclays. “It is clear that the economy does need significantly more stimulus.”The 11.1 per cent oblessness rate in the eurozone in May is the highest in the history of the single currency, the EU’s statistics office said on Monday. The rate climbed in Spain, where almost one in four people is out of a job, and edged higher in France, where President François Hollande’s government is this week to set out key parts of its policies to boost growth and cut the budget deficit.Across the eurozone the number of unemployed rose by more than 1.8m in the past year. Unemployment among those aged under 25 is more than 52 per cent in Spain and Greece.ING’s Mr Brzeski said economic confidence was “far below historical averages in all eurozone countries” except for Germany, where unemployment remains low. But confidence is also declining in Germany, with the country’s manufacturing sector shrinking at its fastest rate in three years in June according to data from Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index.The index showed that the downturn in eurozone manufacturing extended to an 11th straight month.“It will not be long before the eurozone is officially in a recession,” said Mr Brzeski.As the debt storm spreads Europe’s leaders battle to save the eurozoneSome economists believe the ECB will yet stay its hand, leaving the main policy rate unchanged. But aside from discussing its main policy rate, the ECB’s governing council is also likely to consider what it should do with its deposit facility rate – what banks earn for depositing money overnight at the central bank.The deposit rate is important because it in effect sets a floor for market interest rates: banks have little incentive to lend to each other at below the deposit rate.For the past three years the deposit rate has been 75 basis points below the main policy rate. But few economists think the ECB will cut the deposit rate to zero, even if the main refinancing rate falls to 0.75 per cent. “We suspect the ECB would prefer a non-zero rate,” said economists at Deutsche Bank.The ECB held its main policy rate at 1 per cent for much of 2009 and 2010, before tightening last year in a premature attempt at a crisis “exit strategy”. The rate was cut again to 1 per cent in December, when the ECB also announced unprecedented three-year loans in a sign of its alarm at a potential borrowing crunch for banks.
640;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-07-02T10:33:37Z;Manufacturing data compound slowdown view;;The UK manufacturing industry’s woes continued into June, with a measure that shows activity shrinking for the second successive month.Manufacturing makes up little more than 10 per cent of Britain’s economic output, but a revival of industrial activity is vital if the economy is to “rebalance” and rely less on imports and exporting more. Recent readings of the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index indicate the sector is struggling.Manufacturing PMI for June was 48.6 – a figure below 50 signals a contraction. The reading was not as bad as analysts had feared and signalled activity was shrinking at a slower pace than in May, when it dropped to a three-year low. The extra bank holidays for the Queen’s diamond jubilee may have had an adverse impact on the result.“The bounce in the index is welcome,” said David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas. However, Mr Tinsley added that the “big picture” was that manufacturing had experienced a marked slowdown during 2012.The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, which has repeatedly warned that the UK economy needs to rebalance, is widely expected to announce more quantitative easing– whereby the government increases the money supply by printing more to buy government bonds – on Thursday because of signs from business surveys and official data, that economic conditions in both Britain and abroad have weakened in recent months. Most expect an additional £50bn of quantitative easing.The June manufacturing PMI showed a decline in new business orders for the third month in a row, though the fall was less marked than in May. Gloomier still was a further decline in employment to the lowest level seen since last November as companies made more workers redundant and froze recruitment.John Zhu, economist at HSBC, said: “Orders and employment components remain weak, suggesting that manufacturing is still on a downward path.”More positively, manufacturers benefited from a drop in costs, which dipped to a three-year low because of falling prices for chemicals, energy, food products, metals, packaging, plastics and transport. Output volumes gave some cause for optimism, registering an expansion for the first time in two months.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “The increase in [output] provides some hope that the wheels have not fallen off the manufacturing economy, and in particular we are seeing some resilience from the consumer goods sector. However, there’s no denying that the second quarter is looking weaker than the first.”
641;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-26T14:21:53Z;Public borrowing rises as economy dips;;The UK’s austerity plan ran off course in the first two months of the financial year as weak public finances in April and May deepened the gloom surrounding Britain’s economy.Public sector net borrowing was higher in May than in the same month a year ago, confounding more optimistic economists’ predictions and leaving borrowing on course to overshoot the independent fiscal watchdog’s full-year forecast of £120bn.The most worrying element of the figures, economists said, was the sign of slowing growth on tax revenues which are less likely to be distorted by monthly ups and downs than public expenditure.The data came as Sir Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, issued a bleak assessment of the economic outlook, warning that the eurozone crisis was wreaking havoc with investment decisions of companies around the world.“It is postponing decisions that companies fully expect to take at some point – that now is not the time to commit. If everyone does that, then you do indeed get a self-fulfilling downturn in the economy.”Lamenting the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone, the governor added: “It is impossible to imagine a situation in which you just do not know what the situation will be in a part of the world that is close to you and is half of your trade.And that makes it impossible to engage in any sensible forecasting.”The weak immediate outlook heightened the concern over poor borrowing figures in May. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the effect of financial interventions, was £17.9bn compared with £15.2bn in May last year.Both the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, and the Treasury cautioned that it was still very early in the fiscal year to draw any conclusions about the health of the public finances, especially on the basis of official data that were often revised.With government expenditure soon to account for almost half the UK economy and one in five Britons working in the public sector, politicians are reconsidering the size and boundaries of the stateNonetheless, economists interpreted the figures as another gloomy signal on the state of the economy. The UK is two years into a seven-year austerity programme to try to close the current budget deficit and has fallen into a shallow double-dip recession.“The combination of worsening public finances and renewed recession is likely to intensify calls for the government to change tack on its austerity programme,” said Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics.Excluding the distorting effect of a windfall from the Royal Mail’s pension fund, borrowing in the first two months of the fiscal year was about £3.9bn higher than in the same two months last year.Government tax receipts have increased 2.1 per cent in the first two months of the year from a year ago, about half the growth rate forecast by the OBR for the full fiscal year.Within that, income tax and capital gains tax receipts have been falling. They dropped a sharp 7.3 per cent in May alone. However, in a better sign for the robustness of the labour market, national insurance receipts are running well ahead of the OBR’s forecast.Meanwhile, current government spending has climbed more quickly in the first two months of the year than the OBR’s full year forecast. In May, spending rose 7.9 per cent, in large part because of an 11.7 per cent jump in spending on benefits.However, government spending figures this early in the year are often patchy and unreliable and the Treasury pointed to several one-off factors that increased spending, such as £500m of tax credits spending that was brought forward from June to May.
642;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-22T22:18:34Z;Banking shares shrug off Moody’s downgrade;;Most global banks’ share prices traded higher and their credit default swaps spreads tightened on Friday in spite of a number of downgrades from Moody’s Investors Service.Moody’s cut the credit ratings of 15 global banks on Thursday evening, arguing their exposure to capital markets was a structural weakness that made them more likely to fail. While the downgrades are expected to increase the banks’ cost of financing they also end a period of intense uncertainty for the companies.But the cost of insuring against a default fell for most of the affected banks, according to data from Markit. Credit default swaps fell to their lowest price for six weeks at Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Société Générale.Morgan Stanley’s shares pared their initial gains on relief that the bank had only suffered a two-notch, rather than a threatened three-notch downgrade. Shares in the bank, which had drawn the most investor concern in the run-up to the downgrade, rose 1.3 per cent to $14.14.In one reverberation from the Thursday downgrades Moody’s moved on Friday to cut the ratings on US municipal debt.Municipal issuers often hire banks to guarantee or provide lines of credit on certain types of debt that they sell. The debt is assessed by Moody’s based on the rating of the bank rather than the municipal issuer.Some 1,675 individual issues, or $45bn of debt that relies on banks for letters of credit or lines of credit, were downgraded in tandem with the agency’s new ratings on the banks.“The downgrades affect borrowing in every sector of the municipal bond market,” said Thomas Jacobs, an analyst at Moody’s said, including states, cities, hospitals, higher education and housing.For example, debt issues from the cities of New York and Los Angeles to a hospital authority in Eerie County, Pennsylvania were among those downgraded because the debt is backed by agreements with Bank of America.Banks have lobbied and railed against Moody’s in the four months between the rating agency announcing its review of the sector and the results on Thursday.Many bank executives learnt of the downgrade late Thursday in St Petersburg. James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, Vikram Pandit of Citigroup and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs were all attending the city’s international economic forum.Mr Gorman, in particular, led a furious lobbying effort to persuade Moody’s not to follow through on its threatened three-notch downgrade. The two-notch downgrade to Baa1 leaves Morgan Stanley a notch lower than Goldman and two notches lower than JPMorgan.In an internal memo to employees, Mr Gorman said he was “proud of the work that you all have done in what continues to be a very challenging landscape. While I know how hard it can be against the day-to-day turmoil in the markets, I am extremely confident that with continued hard work and patience, our efforts will be rewarded, and that this will turn.”Moody’s analysts said they ultimately refrained from the three-notch downgrade because they believed creditors of Morgan Stanley might be bailed out, if needed, by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The Japanese bank is Morgan Stanley’s largest shareholder.Several banks issued statements disagreeing with the Moody’s analysis. Citi said the downgrade was “arbitrary”, “completely unwarranted” and “backward-looking”. RBS said it did not “give adequate credit for the substantial improvements the group has made to its balance sheet, funding and risk profile”.

Disney agreed to lease the rights back from investors in return for an annual payment spread over 20 years.However, the Revenue told the Financial Times this week that it was treating the “sub-licensing” payments as income and liable for tax, meaning investors stand to receive tax bills far greater than the income tax they originally tried to avoid.The Revenue confirmed that it was in the process of sending tax demands to UK-based Eclipse partners, levied on the millions of pounds of income earned and backdated to 2007 when it began operating.“They will be receiving tax bills for the income from the partnership, backdated. It is as if the scheme never existed,” it said. One law firm said some investors could face “financial ruin”.At least three investors have already contacted lawyers to see if they can sue financial advisers for negligence over Eclipse 35. Future Capital Partners, which conceived the scheme, has filed an appeal, but said it was up to investors to decide whether to pursue it.Thousands of participants in similar film investments could also be affected, as the Revenue assesses them in the wake of its victory.Baljinder Boparan, an investor in Eclipse 35 and wife of Ranjit Boparan, the owner of the Two Sisters food group, said she would end up paying more tax than she had invested. Her spokesman said she was consulting lawyers.“It has gone horribly wrong,” said Kit Sorrell, senior professional negligence partner at Pannone, the Manchester law firm. “Investors will be required to pay income tax on ‘income’ they have never received.He is acting for two people who claim that they were not advised that if the Revenue challenged the scheme they could be liable for tax on its income.“For many investors, this enormous liability will come as an absolute shock and could lead to financial ruin. Many aren’t yet aware that this might happen to them,” Mr Sorrell said.Other investors in Eclipse 35 included Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, the research company; David Casterton, chief executive for London and Emea of ICAP, the interdealer broker; Richard Baker, the chairman of DFS, the furniture retailer; Philippa Rose, founder of a City headhunter; and dozens of middle-ranking City bankers. All declined to comment.Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United’s manager, declined to comment and Mr Eriksson, the former England football manager, could not be reached for comment.Several firms of wealth advisers marketed the scheme, and clients paid them fees of up to £50,000 a time, Mr Sorrell said.Future Capital said it stood behind the investment. “We now have a situation where because of the current economic environment, HMRC [the Revenue] and latterly the government are challenging what are both legally structured and commercial investments,” it said."
644;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-21T09:06:58Z;Germany infected by deepening eurozone woe;;The eurozone is stuck firmly in a sharp economic contraction, with the region’s escalating debt crisis hitting Germany with increasing severity, according to a closely watched survey.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 17-country region showed private sector activity shrinking at the same pace as in May, which was the fastest in almost three years. But Germany’s economy, which has so far saved the eurozone from recession, suffered a significant deterioration, especially in its manufacturing sector – indicating its exporters were being affected by gloomier global conditions.“The downturn is gathering pace and spreading across the region,” warned Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey. The latest results suggested companies were “preparing for conditions to worsen in the coming months, with the darker outlook often attributed to uncertainty caused by the region’s ongoing economic and political crisis”.One bright spot, however, was an improvement in the French purchasing managers’ indices – which suggested some of the gloom about eurozone prospects had been overdone.The weak readings increase the pressure on policy makers for fresh measures to boost growth – and the chances of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates at its meeting on July 5. Benoît Cœuré, ECB executive board member, told the Financial Times this week that a cut had been “discussed at the last governing council meeting and I would expect the next council to discuss it again” – but he warned it would “certainly not fix the fundamental problems” facing the eurozone.Eurozone gross domestic product was flat in the first three months of the year, thanks to a strong performance by Germany. But June’s purchasing managers’ indices – regarded as up-to-date indicators of growth trends – were consistent with a 0.6 per cent contraction in the second quarter, according to Markit. Germany was on course for a “marginal fall” in GDP, it said.As the debt storm spreads Europe’s leaders battle to save the eurozoneSo far, the ECB has stuck to its view that the eurozone will gradually recover later this year – although Mario Draghi, president, has warned of “increased downside risks” to its outlook. But Peter Vanden Houte, European economist at ING in Brussels, said: “It seems clear that no significant recovery can be expected as long as the future of the eurozone remains in doubt.”The “composite” eurozone purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and services, was 46 in June – better than expected by analysts but unchanged from May’s figure which was the weakest since June 2009. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.Germany’s “composite” index slipped from 49.3 to 48.5 but the country’s manufacturing index dropped from 45.2 to 44.7, a three-year low. France’s composite index rose from 44.6 to 46.7, a three-month high.
645;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-20T20:20:32Z;JPMorgan offloads ‘whale’ holdings;Bank tries to minimise exposure before reporting date;JPMorgan Chase has sold the majority of its damaging position in a credit derivatives index that contributed to losses of more than $2bn and prompted multiple regulatory and legal investigations.People familiar with the situation said on Wednesday that the bank had sold up to 70 per cent of its position in the CDX.NA.IG.9 index, which tracks the spreads on credit derivatives of US corporations.Data from Markit, the index provider, showed a record $31bn traded on Tuesday in the index, with 238 trades, a sharp jump compared with the average of less than 50 trades a day.Traders said the activity showed the footprints of JPMorgan exiting trades that had been placed by Bruno Iksil, the London-based JPMorgan banker who gained notoriety as the “London whale” after taking the positions that are behind the bank’s losses.The position on the index is one part – though not the entirety – of the bank’s loss-making trading strategy. CNBC first reported the sale of the position.JPMorgan insiders had said the bank would not be rushed into escaping the lossmaking position, as a hasty exit could exacerbate the losses.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, said in May that the position should “not be an issue by the end of the year”. He appointed Matt Zames, former co-head of fixed income, as chief investment officer to lead the bank’s unwinding of the trade.However, the accelerated trading activity may indicate the bank is attempting to minimise its exposure before July 13, when it has promised to give a full account of the position and an updated loss estimate.One major dealer said he did not see larger than normal trading volumes on Monday, suggesting that the unwind was being conducted with either a concentrated group of dealer banks or with hedge funds and asset managers active in CDS trading.Mr Iksil and his colleagues took a significant long position in the CDX.NA.IG.9, selling protection on a basket of US corporate debt as one part of a complex credit trade. It was designed, JPMorgan says, to reduce its risk exposure before it “morphed” into a trade that added risk and started causing significant losses.Mr Dimon refused to provide more detail on the position in congressional hearings in the last two weeks ahead of the July announcement.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining the trading activity and JPMorgan’s disclosures of the problems. Mr Dimon first described the positions as a “tempest in a teapot” in April before announcing “egregious” losses in May.“The specific [trading] incident has come and gone and I think JPMorgan has done a very good job trying to disclose everything they can possibly disclose about the incident,” Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, said on Wednesday. “It’s not good for us to have JPMorgan going through what they’re going through,” he told Bloomberg TV.
646;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-06T10:11:28Z;Construction figures add to gloom;;An important measure of construction activity hit its lowest level for three months in May but beat analysts’ expectations of a sharper fall.The construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for May, published on Wednesday, registered a figure of 54.4, down from 55.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected a decline to 54.2. A figure of above 50 signals an expansion in activity.However, the data are likely to do little to allay concerns that the UK economy is in far weaker condition than some imagined a few months ago – the index showed slower new business growth and confidence dropping to its lowest level since October 2011.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, the financial data supplier which helped compile the survey, said: “This reassessment of the outlook represents the worries in the construction sector that weakening economic conditions could leave firms running on empty again, once existing projects have come to completion.”Manufacturing PMI, released last week, showed a collapse in activity in the sector that contributes 12 per cent of GDP.The PMI for the services industry, which makes up more than three-quarters of output, is released on Thursday morning. Some analysts believe the Bank of England’s policy makers, who meet on Thursday, will vote to to expand its current asset purchase programme if the services PMI reading is poor.
647;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-06-05T13:30:57Z;Brazil’s data storm;;"It never rains but it pours. Brazil’s purchasing managers’ index, prepared by Markit and HSBC, suggests that business activity in the services sector slumped last month. The index fell from 54.4 in April to 49.7 in May – a vertiginous fall below the 50 line that denotes the difference between expansion and contraction, and the first reduction in nearly three years.It follows the release of the Markit/HSBC PMI for Brazil’s manufacturing sector last week, which was stalled in negative territory at 49.3, and GDP figures confirming a sharp slowdown in the first quarter. No wonder economists are getting gloomy.This from Andre Loes, HSBC’s chief economist for Brazil:The May HSBC Services PMI showed a steep slowdown in economic activity in the services sector. The Business Activity index retracted to 49.7, below the 50 mark and its lowest level since July 2009. While we will want to wait for more data in order to better gauge the situation in the services sector, this is the first sign that the sluggishness in the industrial sector is spreading to services. In any case, the composite index fell to 49.6, the lowest level since September 2011. Overall, economic data for April were disappointing, and the PMI readings suggest that this has persisted into May.Brazil’s two-speed economy, it seems, is adjusting to just the one speed.Related reading:

After last month’s rather worrying data, the latest PMI figures won’t help. China’s official purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing fell to 50.4 in May, its lowest in five months. April was 53.3.And the pain now seems to be hitting the bigger, state-backed companies, who have, up until now, seemed better insulated.As Simon Rabinovich writes on FT.com, it all adds “to the pressure on the government to take more decisive action to support the flagging economy.”Here’s the key chart:HSBC / Markit also released their PMI data on Friday. A quick recap: there is China’s official purchasing managers index, and the HSBC / Markit one. The official one is wider, taking in state businesses; the HSBC index, although smaller, is focused on private enterprises, so tells a different story.The HSBC PMI for May came in at 48.4, down from April’s 49.3 and below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. So the private sector has been suffering for most of the past three quarters, and it seems to be getting worse.Here’s their chart:Barclays’ view was that there will be a quick reponse:We think June will see a number of developments on the financing front: 1) the government will speed up disbursements priority projects; 2) private capital will be allowed to fill funding gaps; and 3) the PBoC is likely to intensify its “window guidance” and call on banks to boost credit. In addition, we also thing the chances of a lending rate cut have increased significantly.Time for action then.Related reading:

649;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Retailers report May sales boost;;Retailers are optimistic about their prospects for the first time in more than a year as they look forward to a fillip from the Queen’s Jubilee bank holiday and the Olympics, according to a business survey.The CBI business organisation’s monthly survey of retailers, conducted in the first two weeks of May, found that for the first time since November 2010 more respondents were optimistic than pessimistic about the next three months.It also indicated the strongest annual sales growth in May for about a year, offering some reassurance after an unexpectedly sharp drop in the official measure of retail sales for April.The survey also suggested the number of people employed in the retail sector increased on a year ago for the first time since February 2003 and showed 62 per cent of respondents planned to increase their prices in the next month.However, some senior retailers fear that Britons will avoid the shops, choosing instead to spend time with their friends and families rather than in the mall or on the high street. They could also be deterred from shopping in central London by the disruption to the road network from the Jubilee flotilla on Sunday.Economists also warned any boost over the summer may well prove fleeting. “Some temporary lift may come from the Diamond Jubilee and Olympics in coming months, but – given how tight personal finances are at the moment – any such increases in spend my well soon be followed by a commensurate fall as households keep their spending under tight control,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit.Retailers have endured a difficult few years as people grapple with falling real incomes. Official statistics show the volume of retail spending is barely higher than in 2008.Anecdotal evidence suggests that clothing retailers have found life tough recently, after the unseasonably low temperatures and incessant rain. The heatwave of the last week or so has provided a much-needed boost.Christine Cross, chief retail and consumer adviser to PwC, says: “The Jubilee, combined with the hot weather, means that worries about having to start summer sales early to get rid of excess stock, may well have been averted.”Retailers’ hopes for a good summer will be bolstered by a survey from the Money Advice Service, a new government quango, which found that half the nation planned to celebrate either the Queen’s Jubilee or the Olympics. Households planned to spend an average of £112 on the jubilee and £208 on the Olympics, while the nation as a whole would spend about £3bn on summer celebrations, the Money Advice service predicted.However, only 41 per cent of the survey’s 2,100 respondents said they planned to spend more than the year before.
650;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-24T19:50:53Z;Growth concerns hurt euro;;The euro fell to its lowest point against the dollar since July 2010 after an inconclusive EU summit left investors unsettled and weak eurozone data added to concerns over the economic outlook.The single currency dropped 0.6 per cent to a 22-month low of $1.2514 after German Ifo data, which measures the business climate in Germany and is considered a good early indicator of its health, came in at 106.9 in May.This was its biggest fall since August and well below market expectations.Eurozone flash PMIs for May added to the gloom. Markit’s survey showed the eurozone’s composite PMI measure falling to 45.9, a 35-month low, which suggests a decline in GDP growth to come.Germany’s combined manufacturing and services output fell for the first time since last November, while the rate of decline in France accelerated to the fastest level since April 2009.For France, that points to a fall in GDP in the second quarter of at least 0.5 per cent while German GDP could also fall if the situation worsens, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.The single currency has now lost more than 5 per cent since the start of May against the dollar.In contrast, the dollar index, which traded flat at 82.1 points on Thursday, has gained 4.4 per cent since the start of May.The euro also provided some excitement against the Swiss franc after it broke out of its usual range near SFr1.2010 and rose 0.5 per cent to as high as SFr1.2076, before pulling back to trade at SFr1.2023.There was no comment from the Swiss National Bank and traders differed in their explanations.However, analysts said it was worth noting that the euro-Swiss franc market was currently illiquid and such a movement could have been triggered by a large but otherwise normal order.Meanwhile, sterling fell 0.1 per cent versus the dollar to $1.5681 after UK GDP figures were revised downwards, from 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent, indicating the return to recession had been deeper than data showed previously.
651;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-24T16:27:04Z;Eurozone economy contracts sharply;;The eurozone crisis has led to the region’s economy contracting at the fastest pace for almost three years and sent German business confidence tumbling this month.Gloomy economic surveys released on Thursday showing worries about the future stability of Europe’s monetary union hit economic activity more than economists feared, with the eurozone decoupling from growth trends elsewhere in the world.They add to the pressure for an even more aggressive response to the crisis from the European Central Bank.Purchasing managers’ indices showed eurozone private sector economic activity contracting in May at the fastest rate since June 2009. France saw a particularly sharp contaction, but the German index also showed the eurozone’s largest economy had fallen into contraction territory.Separately, the Munich-based Ifo institute said its German business confidence index had tumbled from 109.9 in April to 106.9 in May, the lowest since November. The index saw a larger monthly drop last August, but otherwise the fall was the biggest since late 2008 when the global economy was reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank.Gilles Moec, European economist at Deutsche Bank, said optimism about eurozone prospects earlier this year had been thrown into reverse, and warned heightened financial market tension created by uncertainy over Greece “is likely to weigh further on consumer confidence, firms’ investment decisions and crucially on banks’ lending intentions”.Eurozone gross domestic product in the first three months of the year was flat, thanks largely to a strong German performance which meant the 17-country region has so far escaped a “technical” recession, defined as two quarters of contraction. But the latest PMI data are consistent with GDP contracting 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, according to Markit, which publishes the survey.So far, the ECB has stuck to its forecast of a gradual recovery in the course of this year. The euro’s recent weakness could help boost growth. But the latest data strengthened the case for the ECB cutting its main interest rate from its current level of 1 per cent. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said a cut would help banks which had borrowed heavily from the ECB. ”It would help where help was needed – the banks of the worst-hit countries.”Analysts also see the chances increasing of the ECB launching a third offer of unlimited three-year loans. Two such offers, in December and February, saw it pump more than €1tn into the banking system, helping calm the eurozone crisis – but only temporarily.The “composite” eurozone PMI, covering manufacturing and services, fell from 46.7 in April to 45.9 in May. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity. Germany’s composite index fell from 50.5 to 49.6 but France saw a sharper drop – from 45.9 to 44.7.
652;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-22T22:42:02Z;Bloomberg sets sights on data management;;Bloomberg is making a further play to expand beyond its original business of providing financial data terminals for trading rooms by acquiring PolarLake, a Dublin-based supplier of software to help companies ingest, organise and distribute data.The purchase will allow Bloomberg to launch a service pitched at companies grappling with the challenge of managing ever-growing volumes of data at a time when regulators are demanding more transparency around such information.Dan Doctoroff, Bloomberg’s chief executive, would not disclose what it had paid, but said: “The opportunity that exists dramatically dwarfs the purchase price.”Annual spending on software development, people and infrastructure added up to about $3bn, he estimated, with outside vendors currently capturing less than 10 per cent of that market.“We pretty much looked at the entire industry. PolarLake had developed the most sophisticated technology,” said Mr Doctoroff.Others have spotted a similar opportunity. Markit, a smaller rival to Bloomberg, bought the enterprise data management business Cadis this month, but Thomson Reuters is winding down its offering.PolarLake will be run as an independent business unit. “Bloomberg has to be careful. Our past research found that with Thomson Reuters, there was a concern among market participants about a conflict of interest – that if you use the platform, you have to use the data,” said Virginie O’Shea, an analyst for Aite Group in London.However, Mr Doctoroff said: “Other data providers want to be assured nobody else is going to be taking their data other than their customers.” he said:“We are going to be data independent. We are not going to favour Bloomberg data,” he said.The PolarLake deal highlights Bloomberg’s efforts to find new customers, from lawyers to lobbyists. PolarLake focuses on financial-services clients, but Bloomberg plans to expand into other sectors.“We’re expanding the scope of what we were doing. For most of our history, we were essentially a one-product company,” Mr Doctoroff said.The PolarLake acquisition follows Bloomberg’s acquisitions of BNA, New Energy Finance and BusinessWeek, underscoring a newly acquisitive approach at the private company, which has 310,000 subscribers to its financial-information service.Mr Doctoroff added, however: “We enter these new areas in a highly selective way. You’ll see the vast majority of our growth in the next few years coming from organic growth, not from acquisitions.”Geller & Co advised Bloomberg on the deal.
653;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-20T22:09:25Z;Economic Outlook: data set to deepen market woes;;Manufacturing surveys from around the globe this week are likely to provide little respite from the increase in bearishness provoked by the latest flare-up in Greece’s crisis.Thursday will be the crucial date for the release of flash purchasing managers’ index figures, with data provider Markit publishing a reading for the US for the first time, as well as US durable goods orders.“Europe and its sovereign debt crisis should continue to take centre stage this week,” Tai Hui of Standard Chartered said. “Meanwhile, the real economy is likely to remain in contraction territory.“Investors will scrutinise euro area flash PMI surveys for more insight into second-quarter activity after gross domestic product stagnated in the first quarter,” he added. “The May surveys should signal a GDP contraction as the debt crisis escalates, impacting household and business confidence, as well as banking sector credit conditions.”Chris Williamson of Markit added: “Policy makers around the world have highlighted the eurozone crisis as a growing risk to the economic outlook.“The release of the new Markit flash manufacturing PMI for the US on the same day as a similar index for China, and the manufacturing and services flash PMIs for the eurozone, Germany and France, will provide the first picture of how the escalating euro area crisis has affected global economic trends in May.”Analysts expect the eurozone PMI data to remain firmly below the 50 level that indicates a slowing of activity, but are divided on whether May’s numbers will be worse than April’s downbeat readings.“April’s composite PMI out-turn was particularly disappointing at 46.7,” said Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said. “We expect May’s flash composite eurozone PMI to dip further below the 50 level to 46.0, indicating a faster pace of contraction in overall activity in the region. If realised, this would be the weakest reading since June 2009.”RBC Capital Markets analysts, who are forecasting a composite reading of 47.9, added: “Although we forecast the euro area manufacturing reading to record a significant rise and we look for a modest increase in the services survey, both of those index levels would remain consistent with a contraction in second-quarter GDP.”The release of the Ifo business climate survey for Germany is also on Thursday and Capital Economics foresees yet more fodder for the bears. “With the situation in Greece edging close to crisis point and demand from outside the eurozone slowing, we think the Ifo survey might post its first fall in seven months in May to 109.0,” said Ms McKeown.HSBC analysts expect total durable goods orders to increase 0.4 per cent month-on-month in April, saying: “Boeing received only four new orders for aircraft in April and this may keep overall durable goods orders from rebounding strongly after a 4 per cent drop in March.”The calendar for eurozone bond auctions is set to be light this week.As Philip Shaw of Investec pointed out: “In terms of euro area sovereign issuance, there should not be too much to fuel the fire of market jitters, with the emphasis on bills rather than bonds.”

There is more to come”.News that Greece’s far-left Syriza party – which came second in elections a week ago – would not attend a last-ditch meeting to form a coalition sent the Athens General index tumbling 4.6 per cent to 584.04.Political deadlock and the possibility of a second election in June have prompted European central bankers to discuss the possibility of a Greek exit.The implications of an exit triggered fear across the markets, sending the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index down 1.8 per cent to its lowest point this year of 1,004.20.Spain’s borrowing costs flared up and the spread between Spain’s benchmark bonds and German Bunds hit an all-time euro high of 486 basis points. The cost of insuring against a Spanish default also reached an all-time high. Five-year credit default swaps climbed to 533 basis points, according to data from Markit.In Madrid, the Ibex 35 index plunged 2.7 per cent to 6,809.4, led by banking stocks.Over the weekend some Spanish banks announced how much they planned to set aside as provision against bad property loans under new reforms.Bankia led the fall, with shares falling 8.9 per cent to €1.89.

655;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-10T18:00:40Z;UK manufacturing stalls in first quarter;;Manufacturing output stagnated in the first quarter of the year, according to official data, highlighting the difficulties of the sector once held up as the engine of Britain’s economic recovery.Output of the manufacturing sector rose 0.9 per cent between February and March, more than economists expected, but this followed a 1.1 per cent drop in February, leaving output for the quarter unchanged from the quarter before.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the data “provide some reassurance that the UK manufacturing sector is not on its knees, but on the other hand it is clearly struggling to grow in the face of weak demand at home, recession in continental Europe and weaker growth in export markets further afield”.Manufacturing only accounts for 10 per cent of gross domestic product but the sector enjoyed a strong recovery after the financial crisis, bolstering hopes it would help to “rebalance” the economy. However, output contracted last autumn as the eurozone crisis intensified and has failed to spring back.The official statistics have been gloomier this year than unofficial surveys such as the purchasing managers’ index, which have suggested manufacturing activity is rising, albeit slowly.Broader data on industrial production, which also includes the volatile output of the oil, gas and utilities industries, fell 0.3 per cent between February and March after a sharp drop in oil and gas production and energy supply.Over the quarter, industrial production was 0.4 per cent lower than the previous three months, in line with the Office for National Statistics “flash” estimate of gross domestic product for the first quarter, which placed the UK in a double-dip recession.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a respected economics institute, estimated on Thursday that output grew 0.1 per cent in the three months ending in April, thanks to slight growth in public and private services output. But Niesr said the overall picture was nonetheless one of a stagnant economy. “You can’t describe it as anything other than weak,” said Simon Kirby, a Niesr economist.Niesr expects output to remain broadly flat over the next six months before picking up next year.

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD).

Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The euro has traded in a narrow range against the dollar for most of the year amid uncertainty over economic growth and the prospect of further monetary easing in both the US and Europe.“A hawkish ECB is short-term euro positive, but long-term euro-negative, as the ECB essentially does not have the tools to address this crisis, which only adds to market uncertainty,” said Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com.“The lack of action from the ECB probably means that we are back to range-trading for the euro-dollar.”The pound moved off daily lows against the dollar after a survey by Markit said the UK services sector had shown signs of solid growth in April, though it slowed from the previous month.Sterling rallied from a low of $1.6160 on the news but remained slightly lower against the dollar at $1.6186 by the end of London trading, a drop of just under 0.1 per cent.But the pound rose against the yen, which was weaker against other major currencies on Thursday after comments by Jun Azumi, Japanese finance minister, voicing concern over the recent strength of the currency.The dollar rose 0.3 per cent to Y80.35 while the euro rose 0.3 per cent to Y105.64. The pound rose 0.2 per cent to Y130.02.The Australian and New Zealand dollars continued to come under pressure following signs of economic slowdown in both countries. The Australian dollar fell 0.7 per cent against the US dollar to $1.0250, a nine-day low, while the New Zealand dollar lost 1.2 per cent, hitting a session low of $0.7994, its weakest level since January.
658;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Rising cost of bank funds curtails business lending;;UK business lending shrank in March as new lending data showed that the rising cost of bank funding is causing both businesses and homeowners to pay more for credit.Data from the Bank of England showed that lending to private, non-financial companies – the businesses that form the backbone of the UK economy – fell £1.7bn in March, a somewhat smaller contraction than in recent months.Although the number of loans approved for house purchases picked up slightly, the data shows that banks are passing on their own cost increases to mortgage customers, raising interest rates on loans for millions of borrowers.However, a more positive picture of the economy emerged from a separate private sector survey which showed that Britain’s construction sector grew at a brisk pace in April. Strong growth in order books and expansion in employment formed part of a rosier picture in the Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the construction sector, which accounts for 7 per cent of total UK output.The balance survey produced a headline reading of 55.8, above the benchmark of 50 which indicates expansion, but down slightly from the 21-month high seen in March’s reading of 56.7.Nonetheless, almost every sub-sector of the survey pointed to growth, offsetting the message from official data released last week which concluded that the construction sector subtracted 0.2 per cent from overall UK gross domestic product in the first three months of the year.It also contradicts a message from the Construction Products Association, a trade body, whose own research suggests a contraction in the sector this year.Tim Moore, economist at Markit, said the latest readings show a recovery from the three-year lows recorded in the autumn.“Since the 2010 government spending review, the level of confidence in the construction industry has consistently run well below the average seen in the decade before the financial crisis, suggesting there has been a widespread loss of optimism since the deficit-fighting austerity measures were first announced,” he said.However, the Bank of England data showed that overall lending to business is falling at an annualised rate of more than 3 per cent – at a time when politicians are exhorting banks to make more credit available.“Both the supply of, and the demand for, loans will remain contained through 2012,” said economists at Moody’s Analytics, an affiliate of the credit rating agency.The number of new mortgages approved to buy homes rose slightly to 49,860 from 49,029, while remortgage loans also picked up slightly. Economists had expected to see a slight decline in the number of mortgage approvals because of the expiry of a tax break offered to first-time buyers purchasing homes valued at under £250,000.There was also a slight pick-up in consumer credit by £400m, with an annualised growth rate over the past three months of 1.7 per cent.
659;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-02T10:09:42Z;Survey shows expansion in UK construction;;"Activity in Britain’s construction sector expanded at a brisk pace in April, according to a private sector survey, which cited strong growth in order books and further expansion in employment.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the construction sector, which accounts for only 7.0 per cent of total UK output, produced a headline reading of 55.8, down slightly from the 21-month high seen in March of 56.7.Nonetheless, almost every sub-sector of the survey pointed to expansion, offsetting the message from official data which concluded that the construction sector subtracted 0.2 per cent from overall UK gross domestic product in the first three months of the year.It also contradicts the message from the Construction Products Association, a trade body, whose own research suggests a contraction in the sector this year.Tim Moore, economist at Markit, said that the latest readings show a recovery from the three-year lows recorded last autumn.“However, it should be noted that since the 2010 government spending review, the level of confidence in the construction industry has consistently run well below the average seen in the decade before the financial crisis, suggesting there has been a widespread loss of optimism since the deficit-fighting austerity measures were first announced,” he said.The new orders sub-index registered a reading of 58.8, lower than the 63.0 reading in March but well ahead of the 50 reading which indicates that activity is flat. Readings below that indicate falling activity. “Anecdotal evidence from survey respondents suggested that improved confidence among clients had supported the latest rise in new contracts secured at their units,” the survey said.Employment continued to expand in the construction sector, with the sub-index unchanged from that of March at 51.7.The growth in orders was seen in each of the three key areas of work; housing, commercial and civil engineering activity, with the latter two particularly strong. Commercial activity remained the strongest performing area for activity, with housing the weakest."
660;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-02T08:06:46Z;Indian manufacturing inches up;;"Tuesday’s trade figures painted a grim picture of the Indian economy, showing exports falling for the first time since 2009 – but on Wednesday, manufacturing data showed that factories are humming along nicely.Still, inflation remains a cloud over India and some have been left wondering: did the central bank cut rates last month too aggressively and too soon?April’s purchasing managers’ index from HSBC and Markit, released on Wednesday, was 54.9, slightly up from 54.7 in March and comfortably in positive territory (anything above 50 denotes expansion in activity).But HSBC noted: “Of concern, input prices (64.8 vs. 61.2 in March) and output prices (58.7 vs. 54.1 in March) rose sharply as higher raw material costs were passed on to end customers.”This from Leif Eskesen, India economist for HSBC:Unfortunately inflation pressures remain strong and the improvement in new business allowed firms to pass on cost increases, suggesting that they still have some pricing power. Moreover, tight capacity, the weak exchange rate, and the anticipated increase in administered diesel and electricity prices will keep inflation pressures elevated going forward.And he had this to say about the Reserve Bank of India’s surprisingly aggressive 50bps rate cut last month:Today’s numbers underscore the risk associated with the RBI’s aggressive rate cut, which we considered to be a bit premature and too aggressive. If lingering inflation risks materialise it could hurt RBI’s credibility and it would, certainly, limit the scope for further rate cuts.The output index eased slightly, from 56.3 in March to 56.1, because of power outages. But the new orders index rose to 61.1 from 58.1 and the exports index to 56.2 from 55.6 in March.Related reading:

661;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-05-01T10:47:25Z;China PMI: staying afloat;;"As Simon Rabinovich writes on FT.com, China’s official purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing rose to 53.3 in April, its highest level in more than a year – giving further hopes for a soft landing for the economy.Here’s a chart that tells the story:The official PMI has risen for five straight months, with only November’s figure below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion. Not much sign of a hard landing there.But all eyes will be on non-official PMIs compiled by Markit to be released by HSBC on Wednesday. This chart of “flash” PMIs – early indications released each month a week before the complete data – paints a different picture. It goes back several years, so focus on the right hand end.As Capital Economics mentioned in a note on Tuesday, there is quite a discrepancy (our emphasis):By contrast, the manufacturing PMI from HSBC and Markit, which gives a higher weight to smaller firms, only rose from 48.3 in March to 49.1 last month according to the flash estimate released last week. Despite the pick-up, this alternative PMI suggests that activity remains subdued. Overall, it is worth noting that both PMIs now suggest that conditions in manufacturing have stopped deteriorating. But we believe that today’s official PMI probably overstates manufacturing’s recent strength.Related reading:

662;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Weak export orders hit UK manufacturers;;UK manufacturers reported a significant slowdown in activity last month, with export orders taking a particular hit, in stark contrast to earlier upbeat private sector surveys which had belied official data showing a double-dip recession.Moreover, previous figures for manufacturing activity in March were revised down.The Markit/CIPS monthly survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector on Tuesday produced a headline reading of 50.5 in April, against an average forecast of 51.6 – figures above 50 point to expansion while readings below 50 indicate contraction.The latest survey comes just days after the Office for National Statistics reported that the economy shrank 0.2 per cent in the first quarter, a period when the survey was reporting growth.Similar Markit/CIPS surveys for the building and services sector, along with other private sector indicators, have been sufficiently upbeat to persuade some members of the Bank of England that even if official data point to a technical recession, underlying growth is strong.“The Monetary Policy Committee will be focused mainly not on headline growth but rather on indicators of underlying activity,” Paul Tucker, deputy governor, said in a speech in late April, when he also noted that inflation may well prove stickier than had been expected.Economists said they believed the MPC was unlikely to support more gilt purchases, known as quantitative easing, at its monthly meeting next week but they could be resumed if economic weakness continued to show up in official and unofficial data.The survey findings included a downward revision to data in March to a headline rate of 51.9, from 52.1.What was most troubling was a sharp fall in export orders in April to 45.29, the lowest reading since May 2009 and the third lowest reading on record.Simon Wells, economist at HSBC noted that the overall level of the survey suggested that manufacturing was still expanding. “This leads to a slightly positive output reading that chimes with the anecdotal evidence we hear from companies,” Mr Wells said.Markit, which compiles the survey, said the weaker growth in manufacturing was largely the effect of a sharp slowdown in export orders with declines in demand reported from mainland Europe, the US and east Asia.Total new orders, which had been rising steadily since a trough in October 2009, slipped back in April, hitting 49.18, down from 52.41 in March. Markit said total output slipped sharply to 51.83 from 54.32, with particular weakness seen in the consumer goods sector.The surveys also suggest that companies are continuing to pass on their rising costs of raw materials to customers although in April, the pace at which raw goods prices are rising appeared to abate somewhat.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, cautioned against drawing too many inferences from the slowdown in manufacturing for the wider economy because the sector only accounts for about 15 per cent of UK output.“Nonetheless, this reading is likely to pose some question marks over whether the GDP data were right in the first place and [whether] the purchasing managers’ surveys are moving down in line with those,” Mr Clarke said.Surveys from purchasing managers in manufacturing, services and construction this year have been stronger than the official output data released last week by the Office for National Statistics.
663;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Questions are raised over accuracy of data;ONS stand by output statistics estimate;When the Office for National Statistics’ chief economist announced the first official estimate of economic output on Wednesday morning, he faced as many questions about the accuracy of the data as he did about the data themselves.“We have no reason to believe these figures are any less reliable than would usually be the case,” Joe Grice of the ONS said several times in a press conference about the 0.2 per cent drop in output in the first quarter.But not everyone was reassured. Kevin Daly, the UK economist at Goldman Sachs, called the ONS estimate “unbelievable”. Peter Dixon, the UK economist at Commerzbank, said: “Frankly, I don’t believe it.”They were sceptical because unofficial indicators over the past three months had suggested the economy was growing again. The popular Markit purchasing managers’ index surveys of the construction, manufacturing and services sectors, for example, were consistent with output growth of about 0.5 per cent in the first quarter.On Wednesday, the CBI employers’ group released a survey of the manufacturing sector that appeared to show improving orders and output volumes in the three months to April and the first improvement in sentiment in a year.Disagreements over the reliability of official data are not uncommon, but they are important this time because the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee appears to have sided with the sceptics, making it less likely the MPC will approve more quantitative easing next month.In their meeting this month, MPC members said GDP might shrink in the first quarter but attributed it to “perplexing” official construction data. “Underlying aggregate activity growth was likely, if anything, to have picked up since the second half of 2011,” the minutes said.The ONS’s “flash” estimate of GDP comes just 25 days after the quarter finishes, making it the fastest official estimate produced by any major developed country. By this time, statisticians have only gathered data covering 42 per cent of economic activity, so they use forecast models to fill in the blanks. Revisions are common in subsequent months and years, though they are usually small. The average GDP revision since 1997 has been to add 0.1 per cent, according to Capital Economics.Some economists said the problem might lie with the unofficial surveys rather than with the official data. Allan Monks at JPMorgan said he was nervous about the reliability of the services PMI as a growth indicator. “For this reason, we are hesitant to fully downplay this GDP release.”Richard Barwell, an economist at RBS, agreed. “A very bad indicator has lulled people into a false sense of the economy,” he said. “There is no evidence that they’ve [the ONS] got it wrong.”But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the PMIs, said the surveys were sound. “The whole reason why we exist is because we didn’t believe the official data … and this just [reminds us] why we do what we do.”
664;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Eurozone economic activity contracts;;Eurozone economic activity has contracted unexpectedly sharply this month, pushing the region deeper into recession and dashing hopes that action to combat its debt crisis would soon pave the way for a gradual recovery.Purchasing managers' indices for the 17-country bloc fell for a third consecutive month to the lowest level for five months, pointing to an intensification of the economic contraction which started in the final three months of last year, when the eurozone debt crisis was at its most intense. Economists had expected a modest improvement.Conditions in manufacturing were the worst for almost three years, with even German industry faring badly.The deterioration will disappoint eurozone policy makers, especially the European Central Bank, which has forecast a gradual economic recovery this year and shunned calls from the International Monetary Fund for further action to stimulate economic growth. The ECB is instead awaiting the impact of its injections of more than €1tn in three-year loans into the eurozone financial system.The results “clearly indicate that the eurozone economy remains in dire straits”, said Martin van Vliet, economist at ING in Amsterdam. “Our base case scenario is still for a gradual return to modestly positive growth in the second half of this year, but with the lingering debt crisis and the ongoing drag from fiscal policy, the risks are clearly skewed to a more protracted recession.”The purchasing managers’ indices showed Germany and France, the eurozone’s two largest economies, increasingly feeling the impact of the debt crisis. France saw a sharp deterioration in the performance of its service sector in April, while in Germany the latest weakness was in manufacturing, hit by softer demand from European neighbours.As storm clouds blow towards Italy and Spain, European leaders seek to contain the crisisBut the survey also showed conditions deteriorating further in the crisis-hit eurozone periphery countries, “which will inevitably raise concerns about the impact of deficit-fighting austerity measures”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.Eurozone prospects “also do not look good”, he added. “Business confidence slumped lower and companies cut headcounts at the fastest rate since early 2010 in order to reduce capacity to meet lower workloads.”Hit by the economic “shock” effects of the region’s debt crisis, eurozone gross domestic product contracted 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2011 compared with the previous three months. Figures for growth in the first three months of this year, due to be released next month, are expected by economists to confirm a technical recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.Monday’s purchasing managers’ indices suggested the second quarter had started on a still weaker note. The “composite” index, covering services and manufacturing, fell from 49.1 in March to 47.4 in April. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in economic activity. The eurozone manufacturing index fell from 47.7 in March to just 46 – the lowest in 34 months.The indices are regarded as up-to-date indicators of growth trends and are frequently cited by Mario Draghi, ECB president. However, the gloomy readings for Germany have clashed with the more upbeat picture shown by the business climate indicator published by the Munich-based Ifo institute. April’s Ifo index, released on Friday, showed optimism rising for a sixth consecutive month and at a historically high level.
665;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-19T13:44:19Z;Pimco: EM bonds and equities will add power to your portfolio;;"Pimco, the world’s largest bond fund manager, is backing moves by international investors to rebalance bond portfolios away from the developed world in favour of emerging markets.It’s a way of boosting returns and helping to revive the world economy, says Ramin Toloui, Pimco’s executive vice president, citing the example of Norway’s $600m sovereign wealth fund, which increased its focus on EMs in a strategy change announced last month. And where Norway goes, other big investors are sure to follow.Writing in Pimco’s Emerging Markets Watch, Toloui argues that “lopsided allocations” of assets by developed world investors are “inconsistent with the weight of emerging markets in global economic activity.”Emerging markets account for 36 per cent of global output and 68 per cent of global GDP growth but only represent about 4 per cent of the equity portfolios of US investors and “an even lower” proportion of bond portfolios.In bonds, many investors distribute their funds in line with global bond indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation – so a heavily-indebted country figures more prominently than one with little debt.Toloui writes:That sounds a like a dubious formula for successful investing in a world where sovereign creditworthiness is subject to greater scrutiny.He advocates instead GDP weighting, where weights are determined by output rather than by debt levels. Not only will this produce a more balanced portfolio, it can generate higher returns. Last month, a representative GDP-weighted government bond index was yielding 3.18 per cent – double the 1.58 per cent on a traditional global government bond index.Toloui says:Endowments, pension funds, retail investors, and sovereign investors will likely have to change their approaches to achieve portfolio return objectives in a world where developed countries are likely to grow at chronically-slow rates, sovereign creditworthiness is increasingly questioned, and the yiled compensation on industrialised government bonds has tended to be exceptionally low.Investors will not only make more money – they can take credit for assisting in the rebalancing of the world economy. As Toloui says “the elusive equilibrium” in the global economy requires more capital to flow from developed to developing countries. These flows will affect exchange rates, interest rates and other prices, which “condition the behaviour of households, companies and investors in ways that promote global economic rebalancing.”Pimco has been doing its bit for a while: the Pimco Global Advantage bond strategy, which uses GDP weighting to allocate more funds to EMs, was launched as long ago as 2009.As Toloui writes, Pimco is increasing its commitment by organising the credit analysis of companies by industry, and not by country of domicile, and creating a unified framework for analysing sovereign credits on the same basis for developed and developing states.But it takes time. A fund manager, however, prominent, cannot run too far ahead of its clients. And, with only 4 per cent of American equity portfolios in emerging markets, most of the customers have barely left the starting blocks.Related reading:

666;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-19T01:28:24Z;Confidence returns to advertising sector;;Confidence among marketing executives reached its highest in two years in the first quarter, according to a survey regarded as an indicator for the wider UK economy.Advertisers were much more confident about the financial outlook for the industry in the first quarter of 2012 than they were in the fourth quarter of last year, said the quarterly report by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising.Their confidence “net balance”, which was very negative at -44.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, is now mildly positive at 1 per cent, the highest for six quarters.Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data provider Markit and author of the report, said the survey was another sign that people were feeling more optimistic about the economy than they were at the end of last year.“When we took the last poll, things were looking quite shaky with the eurozone crisis and Europe is a key market for lots of companies,” he said. “Domestically, there was also a lot of gloomy news. It is only really in the first few months of this year that the news flow has improved rapidly.”Marketers were also more positive about their companies’ financial prospects, moving from a balance of -12.4 per cent to 19.1 per cent in the first quarter.“Things are getting better, there’s a lot of work out there. Clients are spending money which they weren’t spending before in this big year ahead of the Queen’s Jubilee, the Olympics and Euro 2012,” said Paul Bainsfair, director-general of the IPA.But while the respondents were upbeat about the opportunities for advertising during this summer’s events, they were more cautious about significantly increasing their budgets for 2012-13.Some 22 per cent of companies have lifted their advertising spending but 21 per cent have reported a reduction.Many companies are taking a “wait and see” approach to 2012 after being burnt in previous years by ramping up spending too quickly after the first signs of recovery.“If sales come in quite quickly, they will ratchet up their spending. But if the economy does turn, there will be swift cuts to budgets. Companies are operating very leanly,” said Mr Williamson.“This report has shown itself over the years to be a really good indicator of the general economy and so when we see this picture improving it is a good sign for UK plc generally.”

Asian equities advanced following on from strong sessions for US and European markets overnight.South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.2 per cent by mid-morning in Seoul, the most in six weeks, while the Korean won was the region’s best performing currency, rising 0.7 per cent against the US dollar.The FTSE Asia ex-Japan index rose 1.3 per cent, also buoyed after a planned North Korean missile test failed early in flight. The common view among market participants was that North Korea was testing its missiles to seek attention and concessions from other nations, rather than as a precursor to conflict.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.6 per cent, while in Sydney the S&P/ASX 200 climbed 1 per cent and in Tokyo the Nikkei 225 advanced 1.6 per cent. The cost of insuring Asian bonds against default fell. The Markit iTraxx Asia index, which tracks credit default swaps on 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan, declined 5 basis points to 161bp.Sony dropped 4.4 per cent as investors were unimpressed by the revival plan unveiled by the electronics company late on Thursday. On Tuesday, Sony warned that it expects to make a Y520bn ($6.4bn) net loss for its just-ended financial year, its worst deficit ever.Earlier, a strong rally in US stocks boosted global equity markets but some eurozone government bond yields remained under pressure, as investors in Spanish bonds and equities bucked the otherwise upbeat mood in global markets.The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent on top of a 0.7 per cent move on Wednesday, and has now made up most of the ground lost since a weak jobs report last Friday triggered a sell-off. The rally came even as data showed first-time claims for jobless benefits in the US rose to 380,000 last week, the highest level in two-and-a-half months.The strong opening in New York had encouraged European stocks to rally to the close, with the Eurofirst 300 closing with a 1 per cent gain.The FTSE 100 and Germany’s Dax led the way, with both gaining about 1.3 per cent. France’s Cac 40 rallied 1.2 per cent and Italy’s FTSE MIB gauge reversed earlier losses to climb 1.2 per cent.But Spain’s Ibex 35 index fell 0.8 per cent and has now fallen 14 per cent this year, while most global indices have rallied strongly.Banks led the Spanish decline after Banesto, the Spanish domestic bank, set aside €475m for provisions against bad property loans, and Banco Espírito Santo, Portugal’s largest bank by market capitalisation, launched a €1bn deeply discounted rights issue as part of efforts to rebuild its balance sheet.Spanish weakness also showed up in the bond markets, where Wednesday’s rally in the Spanish ten-year, following comments from a board member that the ECB may resume buying Spanish bonds, ran out of steam. At 5.82 per cent, yields remain perilously close to the 6 per cent mark, at which borrowing costs are seen as unsustainable.“Fears were assuaged yesterday on the reports that the ECB could resume bond buying, which spread an immediate relief,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, “but that effect is waring, off and we may find that the ECB has to follow through with action.”Italian ten-year yields fell almost 9 basis points to 5.42 per cent, however, as Rome appeared to decouple from Madrid in the eyes of bond traders, as well as their equity counterparts.Although investors appeared to be warming to Italian bonds on the secondary market, an auction of three-year bonds by the treasury in Rome, attracted the highest yields since January.Amid talk of renewed activism by central banks, gold soared almost $20 to trade at $1,6777 a troy ounce, on speculation the US Federal Reserve could resume its quantitative easing, while spot US crude prices climbed $1 to $103.72 a barrel.Rumours of further Fed asset purchases also contributed to dollar weakness. The dollar index fell 0.6 per cent, with the euro rising 0.6 per cent to $1.3191, at the top end of its trading range of the last few months.The currency markets appeared to signal some degree of risk appetite, with the Australian dollar, which tends to appreciate in anticipation of strong demand from China for its raw material exports, climbing 1.3 per cent against the US dollar to $1.0439. In contrast the Japanese yen, considered a haven currency, was flat against the dollar.Fresh data indicated that industrial production in the eurozone unexpectedly expanded 0.5 per cent in February, but analysts were quick to discount the figures, arguing that they were probably boosted by temporary factors.Additional reporting by Robin Wigglesworth in London
668;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-10T21:54:23Z;Investors pin hopes on corporate bonds;;"“Shake and shake the ketchup bottle, none’ll come and then a lot’ll.” Investors are much like tomato sauce: problems in Spain could be all but ignored for months, then suddenly on Tuesday everything went red.Spanish equities are now at their lowest level since just five days after the market recovery began in March 2009. Shares in Italy, the next in line for contagion, plunged 5 per cent and are down more than 15 per cent in 14 trading days.Bonds in both countries were dumped, with Spanish 10-year yields just a fraction below
6 per cent (they peaked at 6.7 per cent in November’s panic).The flip side of investors selling the troubled eurozone periphery is more money piling into the safety of Germany. This pushed its two-year bond yield to a new low of just 0.09 per cent. The 10-year Bund dropped to within sight of its intraday low, set last autumn.This is the reversal of the longer-term refinancing operations trade. After the European Central Bank’s LTRO of December and February lent cheap money for three years, Spanish and Italian banks poured their liquidity into local bonds. That money is now leaking back out and into Germany.Neither the euro nor corporate bonds are suffering as much. Both are down, and Markit data shows investment grade European corporate credit default swaps had their worst day since October. But investors still seem to be clinging on to the hope that while things will be bad, they can be contained. On that view corporate bonds, one step up the capital structure from equities, seem attractive.As Matt Garman at Morgan Stanley points out, non-financial dividend yields are now higher than equivalent corporate bond yields, a rare occurrence. Comparisons are tricky (bond yields are nominal, dividends real) but this suggests either dividends will be cut, or bonds sold off, so yields rise.

669;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-04T09:52:30Z;Services data lift UK growth outlook;;Britain’s services sector enjoyed a better month in March than economists had expected, according to a survey, offering reassurance that the economy as a whole had avoided sliding back into recession.The Markit purchasing managers’ index for the sector rose from 53.8 in February to 55.3 in March, a level that indicates a moderate pace of growth. Over the first quarter of this year, the surveys were the strongest since the second quarter of 2010.The output of the diverse services sector is notoriously difficult to measure but crucial for the overall health of the economy because it accounts for about three-quarters of gross domestic product.“A UK recession now looks even less likely,” said Allan Monks, economist at JPMorgan. “But we remain cautious about anticipating anything better than modest growth over the course of this year, with the drags from credit, fiscal policy and weak European demand still biting.”The services PMI capped a relatively good run of economic data in the UK after similar surveys of manufacturing and construction for March. Together, they cast doubt on the estimate from the OECD, a club of 34 rich nations, that Britain fell back into technical recession in the first quarter of the year.While the PMI surveys do not always predict the official data accurately, economists find them useful as an indication of the economy’s general direction.New business picked up in March, according to the survey’s respondents, with a number of them noting confidence was greater and clients were more willing to make decisions. However, the sub-index for new business remained below the levels seen in the years before the crisis.Services companies also increased their hiring slightly in March, with the sub-index for employment rising from 50.8 to 51.7. “Although this . . . is only signalling modest growth in employment, this index has been in expansionary territory for four consecutive months – the first time it has achieved that in four years,” noted David Page, an economist at Lloyds Bank.Inflationary pressures remained fairly strong but input price inflation showed no signs of moving higher, unlike in the manufacturing sector.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the service sector probably grew about 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year and helped the economy as a whole to grow by about 0.5 per cent, after shrinking 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. But he cautioned: “This is no runaway recovery.”Economists said the data would reassure the Bank of England, although they remained divided over whether or not the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee would decide to pump more stimulus into the economy in May, when the current round of asset purchases expires.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indices.
670;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-03T11:02:21Z;UK building activity picks up, says survey;;UK building companies enjoyed a good month in March as activity grew at the fastest rate in more than a year, according to a survey of the volatile sector.The Markit purchasing managers’ index survey of the construction industry rose from 54.3 in February to 56.7 in March, indicating a pick-up in the rate of expansion. Housing projects were fairly steady but there was a rise in commercial and civil engineering projects.Markit said the survey indicated the biggest monthly rise in new orders for four and a half years.“Coupled with increasing activity recorded in the first two months of the year, this bodes well for the sector’s contribution to overall growth of the economy in the first quarter and will raise hopes that the country has avoided a slide back into recession,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit.However, the building sector is notoriously volatile and represents just 7.6 per cent of gross domestic product. In addition, the PMI survey results do not always correspond closely the subsequent official data.Indeed, Balfour Beatty, the UK’s biggest construction company, has warned 12,000 staff in the UK that they could lose their jobs as a result of the downturn in the building industry.According to the PMI survey, though, employment rose modestly in March and confidence was at its highest level for two years.“Even allowing for March’s good weather boosting activity, this is undeniably a ‘good news’ survey,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. But he pointed out the sector still faced problems. “The government’s spending cuts are limiting overall expenditure on public buildings, schools and hospitals.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indices“On top of this, housebuilding activity is likely to be constrained by persistently weak housing market activity, soft prices and a still worrisome outlook despite some recent improvement.”The construction survey follows a better than expected survey of the manufacturing sector, which also showed activity picking up in March. Economists will be most interested in the survey for the services sector which will be released on Wednesday. Services account for three-quarters of GDP.

Coupons have been standardised, but there were doubts that this would boost CDS trading volumes in the short term.“The flow is in a handful of liquid credits. Everything else is traded by appointment and standardisation will not do much to move the needle in those names,” said Christian Stracke, head of credit research at Pimco.“That is the short to medium-term outlook. In the medium to long-term, [standardisation] is critical to the development of the CDS market in the municipal space, and it is much needed in what has become more a risky rather than a risk-free market.”CDS are privately traded derivatives that pay out when a bond issuer defaults.State and local government finances in the US have been buffeted in recent years by lower tax revenues from the recession and heightened pension costs after financial market declines during the crisis.The bond insurance industry, which used to back more than half of this market, largely collapsed on losses related to risky mortgage debt it also backed.Even California, a big issuer of debt, has only $838m of net CDS contracts outstanding, says the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Otis Casey, analyst at Markit, a data tracker that owns several CDS indices, said the biggest obstacle to interest in muni CDS was that the underlying cash bonds allow investor tax breaks on the interest income, while derivatives do not.“To take a long position in munis through selling CDS, you have to be the type of investor that would not enjoy the tax advantage on the cash bonds,” Mr Casey said. Proponents of muni CDS said that group is underestimated and includes foreign investors, pension funds and life assurance companies which will be encouraged by the standardisation.Taking short positions with muni CDS, however, have met with controversy in the past amid concern among public officials that they encourage speculation and might lead to higher borrowing costs.The changes that rolled out on Monday included allowing dealers and investors to trade CDS on single-name entities with fixed coupons of 100 basis points and 500bp.
672;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-02T18:25:57Z;US economy contrasts with eurozone;;Manufacturing activity in the US is picking up as its domestic economy recovers, underlining the diverging fates of the world’s biggest economy and the eurozone.American factory output expanded at an accelerating rate in March, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index. Similar PMI surveys for the eurozone confirmed an earlier estimate that manufacturing activity contracted in the region, with French manufacturing proving exceptionally weak.UK manufacturers, however, surprised economists by expanding a little quicker in March spite of the woes of Britain’s eurozone trading partners.“The world is polarised by the strength in the US domestic economy, which is providing a source of demand for companies worldwide, but against that you’ve got the eurozone,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the company that runs most of the PMI surveys. “We’re left in a position where overall global manufacturing growth isn’t what it was before the crisis.”The US ISM index rose to 53.4 in March from 52.4 in February, a stronger reading than economists expected. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.“The US economy still appears to be ticking along nicely,” said Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Overall, the world’s manufacturing sector continued to expand, though at a slow rate, for the fourth month running, according to an aggregation of the surveys. The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI was 51.1 in March, little changed from 51.2 in February.New orders continued to increase gradually, after they fell towards the end of last year when the escalating eurozone crisis sent a chilling effect through the global economy.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesOne source of worry for manufacturers in all countries was the sharp rise in oil and transport prices. Globally, input price inflation in March was the highest in eight months, Markit said, though it remained much less dramatic than in the first quarter of last year.There were pockets of manufacturing strength in Brazil, Japan and South Korea, but India’s output growth slowed sharply.China’s official PMI survey, released a day earlier, also defied expectations of a slowdown by notching up its strongest reading for a year. However, a separate China PMI released by HSBC showed a fifth monthly decline.
673;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-02T14:38:57Z;Markit buys Data Explorers;;Markit, a UK financial information group, on Monday signalled its move into the securities lending market with the purchase of Data Explorers.The deal will allow Markit, which supplies data on opaque markets such as credit derivatives, to build on London-based Data Explorers’ information on equity and fixed income markets, where the securities lending analytics group has become known for data on short selling of stocks.The provision of market data has emerged as a new battleground in the wake of new regulation that is forcing banks, brokers and investors to increase the amount and quality of the capital they hold. Legislation such as Basel III and the Dodd-Frank act in the US require banks and investors to hold more collateral – the security pledged in a trade as part of a trade – and analysts have estimated the industry may need to find up to $2tn to plug the gap.Institutions can earn fees by lending securities to help them plug that gap and is a market estimated to be worth $12tn. A recent report by Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman said the battle for business from institutional investors was leading to a “land grab” between market infrastructure providers and broker-dealers.The deal is the latest in a string of purchases for Markit in recent years. Lance Uggla, chief executive, told the Financial Times that Data Explorers’ proprietary data could be used to create new products for customers of Markit.“They collect a lot of fixed-income data but have not made product sets out of it yet,” Mr Uggla said.Markit could develop products allowing clients to improve their use of collateral, while developing products for equity market participants in areas such as exchange traded funds, dividend forecasting and quantitative research.The acquisition for an undisclosed price follows an auction by Bowmark Capital, the midsized private equity firm that bought Data Explorers in 2007, which drew offers from several other financial information vendors and stock exchanges, according to one industry executive. Deutsche Bank led the sale process. Bowmark declined to comment, but is believed to have valued Data Explorers at close to £60m when it invested in 2007.Data Explorers has been run since 2008 by Donal Smith, a former Thomson Financial executive, who is expected to leave the company after a short integration period. In a statement, Mr Smith said: “Data Explorers has achieved fantastic growth over the last four years. We have more than doubled revenues and tripled profitability with new product innovation and expansion into Europe, North America and Asia.”The companies declined to disclose further details of Data Explorers’ revenues or profitability, but Mr Uggla said the acquisition was the second-largest Markit had made, and would be financed from cash reserves. Markit was looking for “revenue synergies” rather than cost savings, he said, and expected to retain the rest of Data Explorers’ 100 staff.Markit is majority-owned by a group of financial institutions including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. In January 2010 General Atlantic Partners invested $250m for a 7.5 per cent stake, valuing the group at about $3bn.
674;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Eurozone jobless rate rises for 10th month;;Eurozone unemployment has risen for a 10th consecutive month to reach a new euro-era high, with the pace of increase showing little sign of slowing as the region struggles to return to growth.Joblessness across the 17-country bloc rose by a seasonally-adjusted 162,000 to 17.1m in February, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office. The rise, which took the unemployment rate to 10.8 per cent of the workforce, contrasted with recent steady declines seen in the US jobless rate.The increase “casts a dark cloud over growth prospects for the region”, said Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, with high unemployment across much of southern Europe reflecting “the short term economic pain inflicted by draconian austerity programmes”.On current trends, eurozone unemployment could hit 11 per cent within three to six months, he said, although “that could be the peak”, assuming a gradual economic recovery followed.The data continued to show wide divergences. Unemployment in Spain reached 23.6 per cent in February, and more than 50 per cent among the under-25s. In Germany, the rate held steady at 5.7 per cent on a harmonised European basis. German youth unemployment was just 8.2 per cent.The latest figures came ahead of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, which is expected to see official eurozone interest rates firmly on hold at the record low of 1 per cent.Although eurozone inflation, at 2.6 per cent, remains higher than the ECB’s target of an annual rate “below but close” to 2 per cent, weak economic growth is widely expected to keep downward pressure on prices across the region – with the possible exception of Germany.February’s jump in eurozone unemployment was not as steep as month-on-month increases towards the end of last year, when the eurozone crisis was at its most intense. But the latest rise was higher than December’s 112,000 increase and only slightly smaller than January’s 179,000 rise.Moreover, March has seen a further significant weakening of manufacturing activity in much of the eurozone, according to purchasing managers’ indices published separately on Monday – which is likely to feed through into more job losses.With high oil prices adding to manufacturers’ costs last month, “increasing numbers of firms resorted to cutting employment to control costs”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices. Eurozone manufacturing employment fell in March at the fastest rate for two years, according to Markit.French manufacturing proved exceptionally weak, with the relevant index dropping from 50 in February to 46.7 in March, the lowest for almost three years. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.Even in Germany, manufacturing activity contracted in March, although at a slower pace than in France. Markit said its gauge of employment conditions in German manufacturing was the weakest for two years, with levels broadly unchanged compared with February.Manufacturing conditions also worsened in Spain, but purchasing managers’ indices for the sector in Italy and Greece improved, indicating manufacturing activity in those countries was contracting at a slower pace.The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell from 49 in February to 47.7 in March, the same as a “flash” estimate released last week by Markit.
675;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-02T10:40:26Z;Chinese data boost Asian resource stocks;;Asian resource stocks climbed but wider indices remained broadly unmoved on Monday after stronger than expected Chinese manufacturing data.The FTSE Asia Pacific index was up 0.1 per cent at 244.79 after official purchasing managers’ data in China unexpectedly bounced to 53.1 in March from 51 in February, the strongest reading in a year.The data, however, appeared to contradict a similar survey earlier in the month by HSBC/Markit which had shown manufacturing activity dropping to a four-month low.Analysts pointed out, however, that the official measure focuses on larger publicly owned companies than the survey carried out by Markit and HSBC.“The measure alleviates concerns raised by last week’s release of a weak reading of a private sector measure by indicating that large publicly owned enterprises are seeing a clear improvement in activity,” said Sebastien Barbe at Crédit Agricole.Shanghai’s Equity markets were closed for a three-day public holiday and will reopen on Thursday.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index eased 0.2 per cent to 20,522.26.Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 2.2 per cent to HK$94.40 after its two owners Raymond and Thomas Kwok were arrested and face charges of corruption from Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption.The rest of the sector was mixed, with New World Development down 3.8 per cent at HK$9, while China Overseas Land gained 1.9 per cent to HK$15.06.Chinalco, the aluminium producer, fell 1.9 per cent to HK$3.68 after it announced a $926m deal to buy a controlling stake in Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources.Australian resource stocks received a boost from the better than expected China manufacturing data, but losses among other sectors left Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 index down 0.1 per cent at 4,329.27.Gold miner Medusa Mining climbed 5.8 per cent to A$5.33, while mineral sands miner Iluka Resources added 2.8 per cent to A$18.28. OneSteel gained 2 per cent to A$1.27.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 10,109.87 as shipping companies were boosted by a rise in the Baltic index of dry goods freight rates to a three-month high. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha jumped 6 per cent to Y193, while Nippon Yusen added 3.1 per cent to Y268.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group climbed 3.4 per cent to Y426 after the Nikkei newspaper reported the lender was expected to exceed it profit targets.
676;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-02T09:41:19Z;Manufacturing expands but costs rise;;Britain’s manufacturing sector expanded in March for the fourth month in a row, according to a survey, though companies had to contend with a sudden surge in the price of oil, metals, plastics and components.The Markit purchasing managers’ index rose from 51.6 in February to 52.1 in March, the highest in 10 months. Roughly speaking, a number over 50 signals an expansion in activity. Though the manufacturing sector accounts for only about 10 per cent of gross domestic product, the survey was better than economists had expected and bolstered expectations that the economy as a whole had grown in the first quarter of the year after shrinking 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit, said manufacturers had made a “brighter than expected” start to 2012, with the survey data pointing to output growth of about 0.3 per cent for the first quarter. “This is obviously nowhere near a strong pace, but it is at least sufficient to prevent the sector from remaining a drag on broader GDP growth.”However, the surge in cost pressures this year was among the steepest in the 20-year history of the PMI survey, Markit said. The sub-index for input prices jumped from 44.9 in January – a level that signals prices were actually falling – to 55.3 in February and 60.4 in March.“Given that a pick-up in price pressures appeared to contribute to the manufacturing slowdown in the second half of last year, it seems as if the industrial recovery is still built on shaky foundations,” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics.Manufacturers also increased their output prices by the most in six months, but not by enough to keep pace with the rise in input costs, according to the survey. A number of companies said tough market conditions and strong competition continued to restrict output price increases.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesThe sub-index for output was higher than the sub-index for new orders, and there was a sharp rise in the sub-index for stocks of finished goods sitting in warehouses. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “Manufacturers are still under a great deal of pressure to manage costs and are burning through backlogs of orders to maintain production volumes.” He also said headcounts were being kept to a minimum in part to offset the rising cost of raw materials.According to the survey, employment growth slowed to a near standstill in March.
677;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
678;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-04-02T07:20:57Z;China & India: reading the PMI runes;;At first sight it seemed on Monday that the latest numbers on confidence among purchasing managers in China and India pointed in different directions, with apparent optimism in China boosting the markets with the best result for a year, while India’s figures were flat.But economists quickly judged that China’s data were inflated by one-seasonal influences. So the contrast with India wasn’t really so great. And a modest early rally in Asian equities quickly fizzled out.China’s official purchasing managers index (PMI), announced Sunday, rose to 53.1 in March over 51.0 in February – the highest level for a year.But the shine came off these numbers on Monday, not least when HSBC and Markit published their own PMI index for China showing a decline in confidence over the same period -with a drop from 48.3 to 49.6. It was the fifth month in a row that the HSBC/Markit index was below 50 – the dividing line between expansion and contraction.Zhang Ziwei of Nomura told Reuters that there was little reason to get excited about the official PMI. “If you take out the seasonality factor, this year’s jump is less than the historical average. From that perspective it’s not a very strong signal.”In India, HSBC and Markit reported that their PMI index eased to 54.7 from 56.6 in February. This is still well above well above the 50 benchmark that separates growth from contraction. Indian manufacturing eased in March on the back of slower growth in new orders and output partly due to power outages and raw materials shortages, but remained comfortably in expansionary territory.Economists said the data was unlikely to change the Reserve Bank of India’s likely rate cut at this month’s policy review meeting, but inflation remains a concern that could cause the bank to pause.“I think the best case is that we’ll see a rate cut, said A Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities. “But having said that, inflation is still a worry for RBI and since the budget we’ve seen price hikes with the excise hikes.”Output fell to 56.3 from 60.5 in February and new orders were down to 58.1 from 62.8. Meanwhile, exports grew to 55.6 from 53.9.The markets reflected the rise and fall in sentiment. In early Asian trading, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index climbed 0.5 per cent before dropping back to trade 0.3 per cent higher.
679;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-22T10:14:04Z;Weak eurozone data point to recession;;The eurozone economy contracted unexpectedly sharply this month, all but confirming that the region has fallen into recession, with France and Germany reeling from the effects of the debt crisis hitting much of southern Europe.The falls in eurozone purchasing managers’ indices for March will dent hopes that falls in economic activity late last year, when the eurozone crisis was at its most intense, had given way to a recovery.Much of the latest weakness was concentrated in France and Germany, with German manufacturing output contracting unexpectedly. Indices for the rest of the region improved, but still showed a steep contraction in private sector activity.The setback, which contrasted with recent improvements in US economic prospects, came despite the European Central Bank’s injections of more than €1trn in three-year loans into the eurozone banking system, which have helped revive financial market confidence.The ECB’s action to stabilise the financial system had led to “totally misplaced euphoria” in France and Germany, said Gilles Moec, European economist at Deutsche Bank.“It’s a big case now of ‘let’s get back to reality’. [The eurozone is] still reeling from the collapse in credit flows in late 2011, together with sustained fiscal austerity,” Mr Moec said.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices, added that the latest drop was “clearly a disappointment following the brief return to growth seen in January, and suggests that policy makers will need to seek ways to revive economic growth across the region again”.Separately, Ireland reported it had experienced a “technical” recession, defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction, in the second half of 2011. Irish gross domestic product fell 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending a 1.1 per cent decline over the previous three months.Adding to the gloom, eurozone industrial orders – which offer a guide to future production levels – fell 2.3 per cent in January, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office.The purchasing managers’ indices are regarded as early indicators of trends in economic activity. Economists said the readings were consistent with eurozone GDP contracting by about 0.2 per cent in the first three months this year. That would follow the 0.3 per cent fall seen in the fourth quarter of 2011.Although the eurozone recession remains relatively mild, economists fear the outlook is lacklustre, even if the region’s debt crisis continues to recede. Slower growth in China and higher oil prices would add to the eurozone’s woes.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesThe ECB has predicted only a gradual economic recovery in the course of this year. However, the latest data contrast with the optimistic tone struck by Mario Draghi, ECB president, in an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper published on Thursday.“The worst is over but there are still risks,” he said. “The situation has stabilised. The key data for the eurozone – such as inflation, the current account and, crucially, the public deficit – are better than in, for example, the US. Investor confidence is returning.”The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and service industries, fell from 49.3 in February to 48.7 in March, the lowest for three months. A figure below 50 represents a contraction in activity.The surveys indicated Germany and France were likely to have escaped a technical recession. France’s economy continued to expand at the end of last year. But its composite purchasing managers’ index dropped from 50.2 in February to 49.0 in March. German’s composite index fell from 53.2 to 51.4.
680;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-14T12:02:58Z;Index providers form industry association;Index Industry Association founded by MSCI, S&P and FTSE;Three of the world’s largest index providers have teamed up to create the industry’s first ever trade association.The move comes as the value of index based investments reaches unprecedented heights, driven in part by the worldwide proliferation of exchange traded funds.The Index Industry Association has been founded jointly by MSCI, S&P Indices and FTSE but it will will function as an independent organisation.The IIA’s remit includes educating investors on the role of indices within investment processes and representing the interests of index users and providers.Baer Pettit, managing director and head of the MSCI index business, said the industry body was necessary as index providers realised that there could be issues in the future where it would be advantageous to speak with one voice for the entire indexing industry rather than from the perspective of an individual provider.Mr Pettit said he anticipated broad participation in the new body as the IIA was already opening discussions with a number of other index providers that had expressed an interest in joining.Mr Pettit said the IIA had not been formed to address any specific problems but it would work to promote education about indexing as well as helping set appropriate industry standards and protecting intellectual property.“Transparency is a key driver of much that is happening in financial markets, whether driven by regulators or by market participants, and the IIA will aim to strengthen transparency across the indexing industry”Ron Bundy, chief executive of Russell Indexes, said: “We believe the formation of an index industry trade body is an excellent idea and are supportive of this concept as a vehicle to collectively work on important issues and initiatives for the industry that impact us as providers but also, more importantly, our clients.”Mr Bundy added that Russell Indexes was in discussions around the Index Industry Trade Association and was likely to participate.Dr Hartmut Graf, chief executive of Stoxx, said that he very much appreciated any initiative to form an industry body but any decision on whether Stoxx should join would depend on a detailed analysis of the objectives of the IIA and whether it would provide fair and balanced representation for all the individual members of the indexing industry.Should Stoxx, Russell Indexes, and Barclays Capital and Markit decide to join the association, it would represent all the major index providers.
681;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-13T11:35:32Z;Exports to non-eurozone markets provide fillip;;A record level of exports to non-eurozone countries meant Britain’s trade deficit was better than expected in January, according to official data on Tuesday.The Office for National Statistics said the deficit on trade in goods widened to £7.5bn from £7.2bn in December, but was smaller than the average shortfall of £7.9bn forecast by a Thomson Reuters poll of economists.When the effects of goods whose prices move erratically are stripped out – such as oil – the volume of exports rose 2.2 per cent while imports rose at a slower rate of 1.8 per cent. Export markets showing particularly strong growth for UK goods were the US, where in the three months to January the value of exports rose £1.1bn, to South Korea, where they rose £0.9bn, and Russia, where they recorded an increase of £0.3bn.The deficit on trade in goods with EU countries widened in January as exports fell 0.8 per cent but imports rose 0.4 per cent.Overall, the increase was driven by higher exports of cars, most notably to the US, Russia and China as well as the export of oil to EU countries, particularly the Netherlands and Germany. However, exports of consumer goods to EU and non-EU trading partners fell.“The improvement in exports at the start of the year largely reflects a surge in economic growth in key trading partners such as the US and emerging markets following a soft patch late last year,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit.However, he noted that there were signs that the eurozone, the country’s single largest trading partner, was slipping back into recession, posing a challenge for Britain’s exporters.British policymakers have been arguing since the beginning of the downturn in 2008 that the economy must “rebalance” by relying less on demand from the UK government and British consumers and more on demand from abroad.David Page, economist at Lloyds Bank, said a new dynamic appeared to be emerging in Britain’s trade patterns where exports are benefiting from strong growth in the US and Asia while its traditional trading partner appears to be headed for recession.“Continued sluggish activity in the euro area looks set to be a consistent theme for 2012 and this will slow the UK’s attempts to rebalance, but today’s figures provide further evidence that that rebalancing can take place despite the difficulties in Europe, underpinned by the more competitive level of sterling,” Mr Page said.
682;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-05T18:50:54Z;EU austerity critic’s views gain credence;;Arguing against austerity in Brussels has, for much of the past two years, been a quixotic affair.For László Andor, it included resorting to Twitter to rail against automatic sanctions for highly indebted eurozone countries and giving speeches to obscure think-tanks warning that cuts without investment would strangle Europe’s periphery.Yet Mr Andor, the European Union commissioner for social affairs, is no longer a lonely voice.A series of increasingly bleak economic data from the eurozone’s most troubled countries have given credence to his argument that a policy of harsh austerity may prove self-defeating. A confidential report by Greece’s international lenders last month for the first time acknowledged a “fundamental tension” within Athens’ austerity programme. The country’s manufacturing sector suffered its sharpest decline in nearly 13 years in February, according to a survey by Markit.“With Greece … the medicine that has been used is extremely demanding – and risks killing the patient,” the Hungarian-born Mr Andor says in an interview. “Nobody can seriously believe, except for the very naive, that if you cut wages by 20 per cent, the week after they will start exporting cars.”His scepticism could seem almost heretical in the Commission, which last month received powers to investigate national budgets and recommend fines for countries that do not drastically cut their deficits.But the austerity versus growth debate has forced its way into the political discourse. In France François Hollande, the Socialist presidential candidate, wants to challenge the fiscal pact while Denmark’s Helle Thorning-Schmidt, prime minister, has called for targeted stimulus. The Dutch coalition is split over how to meet EU budget targets, while Spain has announced it will flout those targets, to Brussels’ great frustration.Mr Andor says part of Europe’s problem stems not just from the high wages, and ensuing lack of competitiveness, of Greek or Spanish workers. The too-low wages of German workers has depressed demand, he argues.“There is a European interest that, in countries where there can be wage increases, there have to be wage increases,” he says.Mr Andor, a UK-trained economist, came to his current job after directing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which helped steer loans and investment in eastern Europe.The experience coloured his views on the crisis. He notes that in the developing world, short-term International Monetary Fund bail-out loans are accompanied by long-term World Bank adjustment programmes, giving countries time to get their fiscal house in order. No such policy exists for eurozone countries.“It’s very, very ironic that, in a third-world context, this approach to have short-term funding and also long-term support for structural adjustment was provided, while inside the European Union it was not the first idea to have both,” he says. What is needed, he argues, is a Marshall plan: project financing by the European Investment Bank, more public-backed direct investment and a long-term plan to improve competitiveness.Some European policymakers have begun making similar noises around the need for growth initiatives. But after months of pro-austerity rhetoric dominating the corridors of Brussels, any change will almost certainly be slower than Mr Andor would like.“Intellectually, there’s been clearly a strong bias for an approach that fiscal consolidation, as such, alone will do the magic,” he says. “[But] additional policies can deliver more and better.”
683;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-05T11:30:13Z;UK to avoid double-dip, data signal;;Britain’s economy has lost some of its buoyancy but still seems likely to avoid a double-dip recession, economists concluded after the release of a key survey of the services sector.The Markit purchasing managers’ index survey of the services sector fell from 56 in January to 53.8 in February, the lowest since November but nonetheless consistent with healthy expansion. A reading above 50 signals expansion and a reading below 50 a contraction. The PMI sister survey of the manufacturing sector has followed a similar pattern this year.David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: “These indicators are easily strong enough for the UK not to experience a technical recession, though it will be critical that the February declines do not signal the start of a renewed weakening trend.”The PMI services survey is unofficial and does not always tally perfectly with official data but economists follow it closely because it gives the timeliest indication of what is happening in the sector that accounts for 76 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee is also widely believed to put weight on the survey.According to the PMI, growth in new business slowed last month, with the sub-index falling from 55 to 52.4. Companies also cut their prices, suggesting that they could be discounting to bring in revenue, and employment growth levelled off. However, companies’ expectations for the future climbed to the highest in a year.“That is typically a decent guide to where the headline index is headed one to two months ahead,” said Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Capital. “At best, it suggests that the fall may well be reversed in the next month or two.”Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesTaken together, the February PMI surveys of the services, manufacturing and building sectors suggest that GDP grew at a quarterly rate of about 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent in the first two months of the year, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the company that compiles the surveys.“The PMIs therefore also suggest that the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will leave policy unchanged, at least until it reviews its growth and inflation outlook in the spring inflation report,” he said.
684;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-02T12:25:33Z;Building boost fuels hopes for UK economy;;Britain’s construction sector enjoyed its best month in February for almost a year as work on housing and commercial projects increased, according to a survey, the latest in a series of positive signals about the economy.The Markit purchasing managers’ index of the construction sector rose from 51.4 in January to 54.3 in February, an 11-month high, indicating an accelerating pace of expansion at construction companies.Construction only accounts for about 7 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product, however, and the sector’s output is notoriously volatile. February’s PMI survey puts the index back in line with its long-term average, but it remains lower than the readings of 58 or so posted in the summer of 2010 when the economy was springing back from recession.Economists took some heart from the figures, nevertheless, which come after other data showing continued expansion in the manufacturing sector, rising house prices, increased retail sales and lower inflation. The economy shrank slightly in the final quarter of last year but appears to be regaining some momentum so far this year.“The improved performance of the construction sector adds to other positive data released on the UK economy,” Sara Bingham, an economist at Markit, said. “However, it remains to be seen whether GDP growth for the first quarter will be recorded and, if it is, any expansion is likely to be only modest as general economic conditions remain fragile.”Housing activity and civil engineering activity both picked up modestly after shrinking slightly in January, and there was a big boost in commercial building projects. There was also a surge in new orders – the index rose from 53.9 to 58.3 – though this did not translate into more jobs.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indexes and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesUnlike manufacturing, the construction sector did not experience a sharp rise in input costs last month. Indeed, input price inflation was the lowest in almost two years.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “Commercial construction remains the star performer but housing continues to be subdued. This is symptomatic of weak demand that has been prevalent in the market.” However, he said this week’s Bank of England mortgage lending figures, which showed a jump in mortgage approvals in January, “bode well for better housing performance ahead”.Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics highlighted the sharp divergence in different parts of the construction sector. In the fourth quarter of last year, there was a 41.6 per cent rise in new orders for infrastructure projects, but a 26.6 per cent fall in orders for new public housing. The total volume of all new construction orders in the fourth quarter of 2011 fell slightly by 2.5 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2011. For the year as a whole, new orders were the lowest since 1980.
685;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-03-01T18:02:06Z;Manufacturers report rise in input costs;;Manufacturers suffered a sudden surge in input costs last month, a survey found, highlighting the risk that rising commodity prices could disrupt the gradual moderation of inflation that most economists forecast for the year.The price of oil, transport, chemicals, plastics, metals and other raw materials all pushed up manufacturers’ input prices sharply in February, according to the Markit purchasing managers’ index survey. Manufacturers’ input prices do not translate perfectly into the prices they charge, or those that consumers pay for goods in the shops, but they indicate future inflationary pressures.The PMI sub-index for input prices, which attempts to measure the speed at which prices are rising or falling, jumped from 44.3 in January to 55.3 in February. This was the first increase in the index in almost a year and the sharpest one-month rise in 19 years. However, input prices are rising at a much slower rate than a year ago, when the index was above 70.Britain’s overall annual inflation rate has dropped rapidly since peaking at 5.2 per cent in September. The Bank of England, along with many private sector economists, expects inflation to continue to moderate this year and hopes this will ease the pressure on household incomes.Yet Martin Weale, an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, said in a speech this week that the seasonally adjusted monthly rate of inflation, which fell below a level compatible with the Bank’s 2 per cent target at the end of last year, seems likely to be higher than is consistent with the target in the first half of this year.“The price of oil is a particular worry,” he said. “This does suggest a risk that there may be more persistence to inflation than one might expect at a time of rising unemployment and weak demand.”Brent crude oil on Thursday hit a near four-year high above $128 a barrel. .Overall, activity in the manufacturing sector expanded again after a very strong January, though at a slightly weaker pace than economists had expected. The headline index was 51.2, down from 52 in January. Growth in new orders levelled off and the pace of output growth slowed, but employment rose.Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said manufacturers remained on track to make a small positive contribution to economic growth this quarter. But he added: “Today’s survey suggests that it would be unwise to think that the economy is definitely getting back to business as usual.”.
686;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-29T00:00:29Z;NY Fed ends sale of AIG bail-out portfolio;;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Tuesday that it had completed the sale of a portfolio of risky mortgage securities once held by AIG, the insurer, for a profit.The sale marks a “milestone” for the New York Fed’s efforts to liquidate distressed assets it accepted at the height of the financial crisis. It said the public will receive a “net gain” of $2.8bn, including $580m of accrued interest on the $19.5bn loan the New York Fed made to Maiden Lane II, a special entity created to buy securities as part of the bail-out of AIG.“The completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane II portfolio has resulted in significant gains for the public and marks an important milestone in the wind-down of the extraordinary interventions necessitated by the financial crisis,” said William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.Credit Suisse on Tuesday won the bidding for the remaining securities in Maiden Lane II, which have a face value of $6bn.The interest in the portfolio reflected the rising prices being paid for securities backed by subprime home loans, which were at the heart of the financial crisis. A version of the ABX for subprime-related debt structured at the height of the credit boom has risen about 17 per cent so far this year, according to Markit, which owns the index.Tuesday’s auction was the third in 2012 and followed separate sales for a cumulative $13bn of bundled mortgage debt to Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs.The New York Fed still has mortgage-related debt in the original Maiden Lane portfolio, which was created to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, and the Maiden Lane III portfolio, which contains collateralised debt obligations that were held by AIG’s counterparties and that the New York Fed bought to terminate credit default swaps that AIG had issued.On Tuesday, the New York Fed took bids from a small group of dealers after receiving an unsolicited offer from Morgan Stanley to buy Maiden Lane II securities. Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and RBS Securities also bid. The sale price was not disclosed.“Sentiment this time around is a bit more wary, with many investors waiting to see how the list trades in the face of sharply higher non-agency price on the year,” said strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a research note.Following the auctions, AIG also has bought some $2bn in face value of the Maiden Lane II securities.
687;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-24T17:27:38Z;UK economic contraction confirmed;;Britain’s economy contracted in the fourth quarter of last year in line with an earlier estimate, as a sharp drop in business investment offset the first quarterly rise in household consumption in over a year.The Office for National Statistics said that gross domestic product contracted 0.2 per cent, despite the household consumption increase of 0.5 per cent – the first quarterly rise since the third quarter of 2010.With pay growth lagging behind the rate at which prices are rising, households have been directing expenditure to necessary, rather than discretionary, purchases. The level of consumption is now 0.6 per cent less than December 2010.Business investment fell by £1.7bn, a drop of 5.6 per cent from the previous quarter and 0.6 per cent – or £2bn – below its level in December 2010.The index of services registered a 0.2 per cent rise in December and was unchanged for the quarterEconomists said the latest news offered a mixed picture: exports registered a 2.3 per cent rise for the quarter – the biggest three-month increase since the end of 2010 – while household consumption appears to be rising again. Alongside the fall in business investment there was a 0.3 per cent decline in employee pay.“While it was confirmed that GDP contracted …events since appear to have taken a welcome turn for the better with latest data and survey evidence relating to services activity, manufacturing and retail sales indicating that the economy is clearly growing early on in 2012,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.However, some economists expressed concern about the fall in business investment. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the drop was likely to be an indicator of business confidence and added: “Falling business investment implies that job losses may also mount as companies seek to cut costs.”
688;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-10T11:43:31Z;Manufacturing data show inflationary pressure easing;;Inflationary pressures in Britain continued to ease in January, though there were tentative signs rising oil prices have slowed the rate at which inflation is declining.Prices manufacturers charge rose by 0.5 per cent between December and January, according to the Office for National Statistics’ producer price index, slightly more than economists had expected. It was the largest monthly increase since April last year,a result of higher alcohol, petrol and clothing prices.However, the annual change in prices moderated from 4.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent, the smallest annual increase since November 2010, showing inflationary pressures were continuing to recede overall.Some economists thought the slower-than-expected easing of producer price inflation was significant. “This latest sign of stickiness reaffirms my feeling that consumer price inflation will prove higher than most, including the Bank of England, expect,” Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Capital, said.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: “With Brent crude at $119 per barrel, up almost 10 per cent so far this year, the rising cost of oil could confound the Bank of England’s expectations of consumer inflation falling as sharply as currently forecast in 2012.”Manufacturers’ input prices also rose by more than expected on the month, reflecting higher crude oil prices.However, other economists were less concerned. Producer prices take time to filter through to the prices consumers pay in the shops, and in any case tend not to map across perfectly. They also tend to fluctuate from month to month.”It’s relatively small news compared to the base effects that are falling out of the index in coming months,” said David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas. “So the annual rate of CPI inflation is going to continue to head downwards at a rapid pace.”
689;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-10T11:19:33Z;LCH.Clearnet/LSE talks near endgame;;LCH.Clearnet is expected to make an announcement “shortly” on months of talks with the London Stock Exchange that could see the UK bourse taking a controlling stake, the Anglo-French clearing house’s chief executive said on Friday.The LSE already uses LCH.Clearnet as clearer for UK shares and its fledgling futures business but four months ago entered exclusive talks about taking a 51 per cent stake in it as a way of securing its own clearing infrastructure.Asked about the state of talks, Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet’s chief executive since April last year, said: “We hope to announce something shortly.” However, he declined to comment on the likelihood of a deal, or what a deal might involve.LCH.Clearnet later said: “There can be no certainty that the discussions will result in any transaction.”If a deal were consummated, it would be the first large-scale transaction to be completed in more than a year of failed exchange consolidation.This month, European regulators blocked a proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would have intensified competition for the LSE and LCH.Clearnet.People familiar with the matter have said the LSE has offered up to €20 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at about €1bn. The LSE beat Markit, a market data company, to exclusive talks status with LCH.Clearnet in September. Market had offered €11 a share.Markit’s approach had at one point included NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, both LSE rivals.LCH.Clearnet is one of the most prized assets in market infrastructures given a focus by G20 regulators on pushing swaths of over-the-counter derivatives on to clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the fallout from another Lehman-style default.On Thursday, European regulators reached a milestone in achieving that G20 commitment by agreeing on a new regulation that would require the clearing of OTC derivatives in Europe.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring a deal goes ahead if one side defaults.Mr Axe’s comments come as speculation swirls around the future of LCH.Clearnet, which operates under a complex governance structure as a non-profit entity in which market participants have 83 per cent ownership, with NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange holding the rest.Since taking over, Mr Axe, a former Barclays Capital banker, has streamlined the clearer in an attempt to turn it from a utility into a more commercially driven business.LCH.Clearnet faces competition in OTC derivatives clearing globally from CME Group, the US-listed operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and will soon face Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing in Europe when the Frankfurt-based group launches clearing of OTC interest rate swaps, in March.Mr Axe said: “The old strategy was far more of a utility mindset but it is now one of a commercial mindset where we can reinvest in ourselves.”His comments came as the clearer, formed from the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Paris-based Clearnet, reported an 81 per cent jump in operating profit for the full calendar year, to €106.9m, compared with €58.9m the previous year.Underlying net revenues rose by 16 per cent to €387.2m, compared with €335m last time.
690;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-03T11:29:27Z;UK services show surprise expansion;;Britain’s economy has started the year in surprisingly good shape and might well avoid a slide back into recession, a set of surveys suggested this week, though economists said it would be premature to declare the recovery firmly back on track.Surveys of manufacturing, construction and services companies suggested activity and business confidence expanded in January amid rising markets and a brightening global economic outlook. Yesterday’s purchasing managers index survey for the services sector – which accounts for three-quarters of gross domestic product – indicated activity was expanding at the fastest pace since March last year.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the surveys, said they pointed to a “resounding revival of UK economic growth” in January. The three surveys were consistent with economic growth of about 0.5 per cent, he added.Britain’s economy contracted by 0.2 per cent in the final quarter of last year and some economists have forecast another contraction in this quarter, which would tip the country back into a technical recession. Only this week, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the economy would contract by 0.1 per cent over 2012 as a whole.The services PMI, which attempts to gauge activity in the notoriously hard to measure sector, rose to 56 in January from an already strong reading of 54 in December. The long-term average for the survey is about 55.A sub-index that measures companies’ future expectations surged to 70.3 from 63.5, while employment and new business also expanded. The surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors also indicated that orders and business expectations were rising.However, many economists were cautious about reading too much into one month’s worth of PMI surveys – particularly because they do not always correlate well with the lagging official data.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indexes and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indices“We’ve been here before last year, with high PMIs and actually good growth in the first quarter, but ultimately it was disappointing,” Simon Wells, an economist at HSBC, said. “There’s a chance the leap in business sentiment can’t be sustained because a lot of the fundamental headwinds facing the UK have not gone away.”The surveys could nonetheless have some bearing on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which meets next week and is widely expected to vote for another round of asset purchases to stimulate the economy. Several private sector economists yesterday revised down the amount of gilt purchases they expect the MPC to approve, from £75bn worth to £50bn worth, in light of the PMI surveys.George Buckley of Deutsche Bank, who was among them, said: “It seems possible that this could be the last batch of purchases if the data more generally match the recent strength of the PMIs going forward.”
691;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-02T11:01:52Z;UK construction sector expectations soar;;Britain’s construction companies are more optimistic about their prospects than they have been for eight months, according to a survey of the sector, in spite of slowing output growth, employment and new orders in January.The Markit purchasing managers index for the construction sector fell to 51.4 in January from 53.3 in December. Any number above 50 indicates output is expanding rather than contracting. However, the sub-index for business expectations surged from 57.6 to 66.2 amid optimism about improving economic conditions and new marketing initiatives.Sarah Bingham, an economist at Markit, said: “This suggests that growth may pick up again in the sector in coming moths and, on top of the surprisingly strong start to 2012 reported by the sister survey of manufacturing, will raise hopes that a slide back into recession may yet be avoided.”The British economy contracted slightly in the fourth quarter of last year and economists are divided as to whether it will contract again this quarter, which would land the country in another technical recession.The economic data released so far this year have been tentatively positive. On Wednesday, the PMI survey for the manufacturing sector surprised economists by suggesting output and new orders picked up strongly in January. Manufacturing accounts for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and construction accounts for about 7.5 per cent. Because Britain’s huge service sector accounts for most of the rest, economists are waiting for Friday’s services sector index with great interest.The construction sector survey painted a mixed picture. Output continued to expand on commercial projects, but shrank slightly on housing and civil engineering projects. Employment levels also stagnated after expanding in December. The sub-index for new orders slipped from 55.1 to 53.9 in December, suggesting new orders are still growing but at a slower pace. Respondents to the survey commented that reductions in clients’ budgets had led to the slower rise in new business.The sub-index for input prices fell from 64.6 to 59.5 the month before. This suggests that, while input prices are still rising, they are doing so at their slowest rate since March 2010.However, the PMI surveys have been more positive about the output of the construction sector recently than the lagging official data, prompting some caution from economists over how much they should read into them.
692;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-02-01T22:36:31Z;Boost for top manufacturing nations;;The world’s leading manufacturing nations started the year with tentative steps towards recovery, according to a survey of purchasing managers in 30 countries.“Today’s (Wednesday’s] data suggest that the global economy is faring much better than many had feared at the start of 2012,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the survey with JPMorgan.The survey index rose to 51.2 in January from 50.2 in December, with figures above 50 indicating expansion. The strong data cheered markets, as the FTSE All-World equity index rose by 1.4 per cent.The US manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since June. “Manufacturing is starting out the year on a positive note, with new orders, production and employment all growing in January,” said Bradley J Holcomb, who chairs the Institute for Supply Management, which conducts the US survey.Indian factory output recorded its biggest surge on record. The rise follows December’s decision by India’s central bank to end aggressive monetary tightening and a raft of positive economic data. However, some analysts warned that the strong numbers did not reflect the broader state of the economy.“The PMI numbers are extremely robust but they don’t tell the whole story,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank. “Consumption growth has improved, that’s clear, but unfortunately investment [is lagging].”In China, the official purchasing managers’ index rose only fractionally to 50.5, but confounded forecasts for a decline. The figure relied on estimates to take account of the effect of the lunar new year holiday. which was celebrated in January.Interactive tool tracking Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Indexes and ISM’s purchasing managers’ and non-manufacturers’ survey indicesThe eurozone Markit index remained below 50, indicating that business conditions had worsened for the sixth consecutive month.The European figures broadly mirrored Monday’s unemployment figures , which highlighted the growing gap between members of the 17-country eurozone. The German index reached a six-month high of 51, while Greece’s fell to 41. The Greek manufacturing sector has recorded only one month-on-month expansion since October 2008.Monday’s European Union summit, at which 25 of the bloc’s 27 members agreed a treaty to enshrine tough new fiscal rules, ignited a debate about whether austerity policies are choking off economic recovery.Leading European manufacturers including Siemens and Philips have blamed sagging demand in Europe for recent poor results.Ewald Nowotny, a member of the European Central Bank’s council, warned on Monday: “We could have stagnation in the euro region as a whole or recession in certain phases.”Tom Burgis and Sarah O’Connor in London, Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing and James Fontanella-Khan in New Delhi
693;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

The government sector, especially defence, knocked almost one percentage point off output.The report suggests that the US economy has got over its swoon in the summer of 2011, and is expanding steadily, but that there are still headwinds preventing an acceleration in growth. Consumption rose at a modest annualised rate of 2 per cent.Final sales to domestic purchasers, a measure of output bought by all sectors in the US rather than exported or piled up in warehouses, rose at an annualised rate of only 0.9 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent in the third quarter.The report “confirms the acceleration of growth that had been hinted at by a flurry of upbeat economic indicators and business surveys in recent weeks, but also reveals that the economy is less healthy than the headline growth rate would suggest,” said Chris Williamson, chief economst at Markit in London.One encouraging sign in the report was a turnaround in housebuilding, with residential investment rising at an annualised rate of 10.9 per cent, although analysts said this may reflect unusually warm weather that allowed for more days of building work.Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services, said he expects US growth to be “a trend-like 2.4 per cent in 2012, and job growth will average about 140,000 per month, adding up to 1.7m new payroll jobs over the course of this year”.Also on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index showed optimism jumped in January to the highest level in almost a year, rising to 75 from 69.9 in December. That was higher than an earlier reading of 74 and surpassed forecasts.Consumers were more positive about both current and future conditions, and nearly a third of respondents said they had heard about new jobs.“The recent gains in confidence are now critically dependent on continued gains in employment,” said Richard Curtin, survey director. “As long as modest employment gains are forthcoming, the data suggest real consumer spending will post a gain of 2.1 per cent in 2012.”The data suggest that November’s presidential election is most likely to be fought against a backdrop of modest but unspectacular growth and still high unemployment.“While the continued expansion is encouraging, faster growth is needed to replace the jobs lost in the recent downturn and to reduce long-term unemployment,” noted Alan Krueger, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers.Kevin Brady, the senior Republican on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said that the report contained “some welcome news” but not enough. “The economy simply isn’t expanding fast enough to generate a sufficient number of jobs to bring down the unemployment rate rapidly, and the policies of the Obama administration – such as the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline – continue to dampen growth,” he said.
695;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-23T00:07:22Z;‘Squeezed middle’ set for more pain;;Continued low interest rates and the start of a fall in inflation offer only limited respite to a group whose finances are increasingly precarious, according to new research published on Monday.The report by Resolution Foundation, an independent think-tank, forecasts that the “squeezed middle” would remain the important political battleground, as further deep cuts to tax credits due this April intensified the effects of the continued wage squeeze.Real household incomes for those with low-to-middle incomes – representing nearly a third of working age households – were broadly the same in 2010-2011 as they were back in 2001-2002, partly because wages fell sharply during the downturn and partly because men on less than average earnings have seen their real wages decline since 2003.Consumers’ discretionary spending power, defined as the income left over after paying for essentials, saw a slight improvement to 0.4 per cent in December from a year earlier, says Lloyds TSB, the bank. The proportion of consumers who have money left over after covering monthly outgoings has risen from 29 per cent last July to 34 per cent.The think-tank’s research came out the same day as Markit, the information services company, reported that households were experiencing the slowest deterioration in their finances since December 2010 as lower inflation eases the squeeze on family budgets.Britons were less downbeat about their finances than they had been at the end of last year, even though employment income was declining at its fastest rate for three years, Markit found.About 33 per cent of households indicated that their finances worsened during the month, compared to 6 per cent that saw an improvement.Commenting on the the study Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: “The year has started with a few chinks of light for household finances, helped in no small part by a drop in inflationary pressures on the high street and recent news of energy price reductions.”But he added that there was no sign of a step-change in financial pressures. Squeezed pay settlements meant that household budgets had little room for manoeuvre if inflation were unexpectedly to rise.Low income households were the most downbeat about their future finances, but their pessimism was less marked than it had been for two years.Pressures on low-to-middle income households were emphasised by a separate study today which forecasted that the incomes of this group were unlikely to rise beyond pre-recession levels until 2020 at the earliest.
696;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-20T17:26:48Z;UK retailers enjoy Christmas bounce;;Britons took a break from austerity over Christmas as they parted more freely with their cash on the country’s high streets, encouraged by the generous discounts on offer from desperate retailers.Official retail sales figures show a robust rise in spending last month, especially compared with the previous December, when heavy snow kept people indoors. But retailers were in no mood to celebrate, saying they only managed to keep their tills ringing by cutting their prices and profitability.“Retailers achieved these sales through heavy and prolonged discounting and this has seriously damaged the health of the retail sector,” Helen Dickinson, head of retail at accountancy firm KPMG, said. This month, Tesco issued its first profit warning in 20 years and Peacocks, the budget clothing chain, filed for administration, though other retailers reported good results.Retail sales volumes rose by 0.6 per cent between November and December, the Office for National Statistics said, and were 2.6 per cent higher than the same month a year earlier. Because retail sales numbers tend to be volatile, some economists prefer to look at them on a rolling three-month basis. In the three months to December, sales were 1.1 per cent higher than the previous three months, the biggest rise since the summer of 2010.The improvement on the country’s high streets comes at the end of a difficult year for Britons, who have struggled to cope with sluggish wage growth and high inflation. Most economists and retail industry executives expect 2012 to remain tough.“We do not think this pace of increase will be sustained in the coming months given the cautious mood of British consumers and the fact that they are experiencing the most severe real income squeeze in decades,” Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays Capital, said.In a sign of retailers’ attempts to make their products more affordable, the so-called annual price deflator, a measure the ONS uses to strip out the effects of inflation, fell to 2.4 per cent in December, the lowest for 16 months and down from a peak of 5.2 per cent in August.For all the gloom among national retailers, the data suggest smaller retailers are faring better. Small retailers, defined as those with fewer than 100 employees, saw sales rise at roughly double the pace of the big retailers, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures that compare last month’s sales with the same month a year earlier.Clothing and footwear stores enjoyed a 6.3 per cent jump in sales volumes compared with a year earlier. Shops selling alcohol and cigarettes also had an unusually good Christmas: on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, sales at these shops surged by almost 25 per cent from a year earlier, after falling year-on-year for each of the previous four years.Online sales dipped slightly in December after peaking in November, possibly because people ordered Christmas presents early to make sure they arrived in time.
697;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Advertising expects two paths in gloom;;As many UK marketing executives are raising budgets as cutting them despite falling business confidence, an industry barometer has found, in a sign that some agencies plan to spend their way out of the economic gloom.The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising’s quarterly Bellwether report, compiled by Markit Economics, found that total marketing spending showed only a “marginal” upturn in the fourth quarter of 2011, even with the boost provided by the London Olympics, with one in five survey respondents increasing budgets and 19 per cent reducing them.Marketing executives’ confidence in the financial outlook for their industry fell to its lowest point in 11 quarters, at a “net balance” between optimists and pessimists of -44.9 per cent, when Britain was in the depths of recession.“Companies are bracing themselves for a tough time ahead,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, “and it seems that one of the tacks they are taking is to at least maintain their marketing spend for the current year to fight the possible downsides in the wider economy with their own promotional work to win sales.”Spending on traditional media, particularly newspapers, is being cut back and reinvested in web advertising and search-engine marketing, the IPA Bellwether found. Budgets for direct marketing and in-store sales promotion are also being nudged higher.Advertising spending is often seen as a leading indicator for wider economic trends. Markit expects the UK economy as a whole to have stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2011, before sliding back into two quarters of mild recession early this year, but the effect on advertising is far less severe than in 2008-09.“Companies do have cash to spend and they are willing to invest in supporting their products in the year ahead,” Mr Williamson said.“What we are not seeing, which people might have expected to see, is that every­body has cut [their ad budgets]”, said Nicola Mendelsohn, president of the IPA and executive chairman of Karmarama, a London agency, suggesting that companies which pulled back sharply on marketing spending during the recent recession had suffered more than those that did not.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, said he expected to be able to continue to hire more staff in the UK, after adding about 1,300 new jobs (10 per cent of its workforce) last year.“In our experience, the UK has been strong,” he said. “But that said, the prospects for western Europe are not good. It’s going to be a hard slog.”Reflecting that, many agencies are preparing for a leaner period.“My feeling is one of a sustained period of uncertainty,” said Robert Senior, UK chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi Fallon, a Publicis-owned agency. “I am therefore going to …curb my expenses accordingly, on the basis it doesn’t smell too good. I’m nervous and cautious but it’s business as usual at the moment.”He said that with so much bad news around, good advertising could provide light relief.
698;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-17T16:55:18Z;UK inflation slows to 4.2%;;Britain’s high rate of annual inflation slowed in December for the third month in a row, offering solace to the Bank of England as it contemplates another round of asset purchases to stimulate the economy.The 4.2 per cent annual rise in the consumer price index – down from 4.8 per cent the previous month and a peak of 5.2 per cent in September – was widely expected and reflected heavy discounting on the high street and lower fuel prices.“Obviously these falls in inflation will help to alleviate the squeeze on households’ real pay,” Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics said, “but the deteriorating labour market and tightening credit conditions will maintain the downward pressure on consumer spending this year.”The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee opted to hold policy steady this month, but most economists expect it to vote for more so-called quantitative easing next month when the current round of asset purchases expires. The Bank has repeatedly insisted that Britain’s high rate of inflation is only temporary.Most economists expect annual inflation to fall further over the next few months as utility prices come down and the effect of last year’s increase in value added tax drops out of the annual comparison. “But then it becomes interesting, because we’ll get a better read on underlying inflation,” Jens Larsen, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, said. He predicts underlying inflation will prove more stubborn than the Bank of England expects. “It is still a little early to celebrate the coming of a low-inflation era.”Others are more confident. David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said inflation “should finally be back within spitting distance of the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target” by the time of the Olympic Games in London.Deep discounts in clothing shops and supermarkets in the run-up to Christmas were one reason for the lower CPI figure last month. Clothing and footwear prices fell 2.8 per cent between November and December, compared with a fall of 1.9 per cent at the same time a year earlier. There was also a record 1.5 per cent fall in the price of alcohol and cigarettes as supermarkets battled for custom. Wine prices fell 3.3 per cent and spirit prices fell 4.4 per cent.Petrol prices fell by 1.1p a litre between November and December, whereas in the same period a year earlier they climbed by 3.2p a litre.The annual inflation rate also moderated because some events that happened a year earlier were not repeated. In late 2010, some retailers were already pushing through higher prices in anticipation of the rise in value added tax at the start of 2011. Utility prices were also rising quickly.Indeed, between November and December 2010, the price of gas rose 4.6 per cent, the price of electricity rose 1.2 per cent and the price of liquid fuels such as heating oil rose 26.1 per cent. Between November and December of last year, in contrast, gas and electricity prices did not change and liquid fuel prices rose by just 0.4 per cent.Chris Crowe, an economist at Barclays Capital, said recent announcements from utility companies hinted at more downward pressure on the annual inflation rate. “We expect to see gas and electricity prices decline by around 2.3 per cent in the next four months as a result of the round of cuts announced by the ‘big six’ firms,” he said. “This should subtract around 0.1pp from headline inflation.”Annual inflation measured by the retail price index fell to 4.8 per cent in December from 5.2 per cent in November.
699;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-12T17:46:26Z;Fall in industrial production raises growth worries;;Industrial production sagged in October and November as declines in the output of the mining, quarrying and utilities sectors compounded a difficult period for UK manufacturing.The output statistics were worse than economists had expected and exacerbated fears that the economy as a whole could have stagnated or even contracted in the final quarter of last year. The UK’s economy leans much more on services than it does on industry, but the latter still accounts for about 15 per cent of gross domestic product.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said the industrial sector “looks to have contracted over the fourth quarter as a whole, perhaps by as much as 1 per cent or even more, acting as a significant drag on the economy”.In spite of the poor data, the Bank of England’s interest rates setting body remained in wait-and-see mode yesterday as it voted to keep interest rates at their record low of half a percentage point and to maintain its gilts buying programme, known as quantitative easing, at the current level of £275bn. Most economists expect the Bank to increase the QE programme next month when the current round of gilt purchases comes to an end.Separately, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a respected economics institute, estimated that the economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. While growth at such an anaemic rate would represent a significant loss of momentum, the estimate is nevertheless more optimistic than that of many economists.The first official estimate of GDP in the fourth quarter will be released on January 25.Overall industrial production fell by 0.6 per cent between October and November, while the decline between September and October was revised from 0.7 per cent to 1 per cent.Manufacturing, which accounts for two thirds of overall industrial production, fell by 0.2 per cent between October and November following a 0.9 per cent fall between September and October.Much of the weakness in the industrial production figures came from the utilities industry, which may have been hit by an unusually warm autumn and winter. Output was 8.6 per cent lower in November than in the same month a year earlier.“The favourable weather is doubtless one of the reasons for the fall in utility output over the month,” David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said. “It was the second warmest November in over 100 years, with only 1964 warmer.”Mining and quarrying production also declined sharply. It fell 2.2 per cent between October and November and 14.2 per cent from a year ago.Within the larger manufacturing sector, the biggest monthly declines in output were in the production of chemicals, basic metals and wood, paper and printing products. The biggest increases were in the food and beverages industry and transport equipment.Unofficial but widely followed surveys of the manufacturing, services and construction sectors suggested last week that the economy was more resilient in December than in the preceding months.“While last week’s surveys suggested that the overall economy might have avoided recession in the fourth quarter, the softer tone of the official data suggests that prospect is still very much alive,” Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
700;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-05T12:17:22Z;UK service sector lightens economic gloom;;Britain’s large services sector ended last year on a surprisingly strong note, raising hopes the economy has more momentum going into 2012 than economists had feared.Markit’s purchasing managers’ index, which attempts to gauge how quickly activity is expanding or contracting in the services sector, rose from 52.1 in November to 54 in December. This was the highest level since July and much higher than the reading of 51.5 that economists expected. Markit says any number above 50 indicates activity is expanding.Although the service sector’s output is difficult to measure accurately, it is crucial for the economy as it accounts for more than three quarters of gross domestic product. The survey follows positive surprises from the PMI surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors.“Despite probable weakness in the fourth quarter, these numbers suggest that the UK may avoid recession if this change in momentum continues,” Steven Bryce, an economist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients.The so-called composite PMI, which is a weighted average of the manufacturing, construction and services surveys, rose from 51.2 in November to 53.2 in December. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said this upswing was not enough to stop the surveys for the quarter as a whole coming in at their weakest since the second quarter of 2009.In good news for the labour market, employment in the services sector appeared to stabilise rather than shrink for the first time since June. New business also came in at a faster rate, while outstanding business fell at a slower rate.Markit said a number of respondents reported higher enquiry levels and a general improvement in business opportunities. Growth was most vigorous in the hotels, catering and restaurants sector and the transport, storage and communications sector.In a sign that companies might be sacrificing some profits to achieve this level of activity, input prices rose at a faster rate in December while prices charged continued to decline slightly.In spite of improving conditions, companies’ expectations for the future darkened. “The intense gloom throughout the media is clearly concerning UK businesses, but it does not seem to be overtly damaging their actual activity,” Philip Rush, an economist at Nomura, said.Some economists were loath to read too much into the PMI surveys, pointing out that they have been more positive recently than the less timely official statistics.
701;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-04T18:58:13Z;Glimmer of hope as UK business lending rises;;Signs of modest improvement in the UK economy emerged on Wednesday as data showed the first rise in lending to businesses in months and a closely watched survey showed output in the construction sector expanded in December, rather than contracting as most economists had expected.However, the overall picture remained mixed. The cost of borrowing for the smallest businesses continued to rise, with charges at a record high when compared to rates charged to the biggest employers. Moreover, while the profitability of British companies generally rose in the third quarter of this year to the best levels since late 2008, that of manufacturing companies fell to its lowest level since the data series began in 1997.Bank of England data show that lending to private, non-financial companies– the backbone of the economy – rose by £1.8bn in November from October, more than offsetting the declines of the previous two months.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the sector rose to 53.2 in December from 52.3 in November. Economists had expected a decline of a percentage point. Sub-components point to several positive trends, particularly for employment. Panellists cited higher new orders and output as the main contributors to the increase in staffing.Bank data on Wednesday also provide a stark illustration of how the restricted availability of credit is affecting companies. The average interest rate on new advances of £1m or less was 3.81 per cent, more than two percentage points higher than the average 1.72 per cent charged on loans larger than £20m.A recent survey of economists conducted by the Financial Times cast doubt on the effectiveness of “credit easing” efforts by government in lowering the cost of lending to small businesses.Separately, official data from the Office for National Statistics suggested the manufacturing sector may not be as buoyant as some had believed. While services companies achieved a return on capital of 15.9 per cent – the best since the fourth quarter of 2008 – manufacturers earned only 5.0 per cent, the lowest quarterly value since the series began in 1997. Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said the poor profitability of manufacturing was not helpful if the goal was to shift demand away from households and government and towards the sale of goods overseas.“The numbers suggest that the prospects of a rebalancing of the UK economy are not good,” Mr Saunders said.
702;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-03T11:47:24Z;UK manufacturing heads for shallow recession;;"Britain's manufacturing sector is stagnating rather than contracting, according to a closely watched survey of activity in December.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector produced a headline reading of 49.6, a shade below the level indicating stability but better than the headline reading of 47.7 seen in November.Moreover, some key sub-components of the index showed genuine signs of improvements. The reading on export orders jumped into positive territory, hitting 53.5, up from 49.0 in November and was the first reading above the key neutral level of 50 since July 2011. New orders overall rose to 49.2 from 46.3 in November while employment appears to have contracted more slowly in December.David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas, noted that the reading is the best for the sector since September and follows an overall firmer tone to similar surveys in the eurozone earlier in the week.“It puts the UK manufacturing sector looking a little firmer than the eurozone at pulling out of the nose-dive in activity, though a better December reading was also seen in the German and French indices,” Mr Tinsley said. “So as we enter 2012 hopes that the manufacturing recession will be fairly shallow continue to have credence.”David Page, economist at Lloyds Bank, noted that the improvement seen between November and December in the UK manufacturing PMI survey is even greater than that seen on most of the continent. Nevertheless, he said, “the fourth quarter average of 48.3 still suggests a fairly marked drop in manufacturing. Indeed, with a recessionary outlook for Europe, the prospects for UK manufacturing and wider GDP remain depressed. “The survey also provided more evidence that inflationary pressures on manufacturers are receding; the key input prices index, which includes what producers pay for raw materials, was firmly in negative territory at 47.1, down from 48.9 in November and the lowest reading on prices since February 2010."
703;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Factory data offer glimmer of hope;;Global manufacturers have entered 2012 in downbeat fashion but new data provided a glimmer of hope as factory activity eased its downward spiral in parts of the eurozone and manufacturing expanded in India and China.Purchasing managers indices remain in contraction across many leading economies, reflecting fears that financial market turmoil and the troubles of debt-encumbered eurozone countries are tipping the currency bloc into another recession.However, the rate of decline eased in several countries in December, and there remained considerable variation between large economies. In the US, an ISM manufacturing survey due for release on Tuesday was expected to show a modest improvement as the US economy continued to resist a slowdown in Europe.Overall eurozone production declined for a fifth consecutive month in December, according to Markit, which compiles data from a survey of around 3,000 manufacturing firms.Its eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in on Monday at 46.9, unchanged from a previous December estimate but 0.5 points higher than November. A result below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: “Eurozone manufacturing is clearly undergoing another recession.“Despite the rate of decline easing slightly in December, production appears to have been collapsing across the single currency area at a quarterly rate of approximately 1.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2011.”But Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands continued to show signs of resilience compared to the weaker economies of southern Europe, in part due to their ability to export goods to still-growing emerging markets.German PMI was adjusted higher to 48.4 from an initial estimate of 48.1, showing an improvement from November’s reading of 47.9.Franz Fehrenbach, chief executive of Germany’s Bosch, the world’s biggest supplier of car parts, said: “We are bracing ourselves for further weakening in economic growth but so far we don’t foresee a global recession.”In contrast, Spain’s manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums in December, with Markit’s PMI gauge showing a result of 43.7, little changed from the previous month.Economists said the contraction in manufacturing activity in Italy was somewhat slower than in November but a reading of 44.3 still suggests the environment for Italian producers remains tough.In China, a closely watched purchasing managers’ index improved slightly from 49 in November to 50.3 in December, as other Asian manufacturers also showed signs of stabilisation. An Indian PMI gauge rose from 51 to 54.2 and a Taiwanese manufacturing barometer eased from 43.9 to 47.1.Analysts at Danske Research said that while Chinese growth “remained subdued . . . the Chinese economy does not appear to be deteriorating further”.In South Korea, however, manufacturing activity remained at a three-year low as HSBC’s purchasing managers’ index, based on 400 South Korean factories, fell to 46.4 in December, from 47.1 in November.“It seems that the waves heading toward us this year will be much higher. The world economy is slipping into a new era of low growth, not just a temporary recession,” Lee Myung-bak, South Korea’s president, said in his New Year address to the nation on Monday.

705;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-02T17:22:30Z;Euro hit by Spanish deficit warning;;The euro weakened despite better than expected European manufacturing data, while resource-linked currencies gained following upbeat economic reports from China and India.European factory activity slowed for the fifth straight month, according to the region-wide purchasing managers’ index compiled by Markit released on Monday, but the rate of decline slowed. The index came in at 46.9 in December, versus 46.4 in November.However, the euro slipped 0.3 per cent to $1.2925 versus the dollar, and 0.3 per cent to Y99.40 versus the yen, as worries about struggling European economies remained.Spain’s finance minister said on Monday that the country’s budget deficit for last year would likely be 8 per cent instead of the projected 6 per cent.Additionally, bearish bets against the euro reached another record last week, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Futures contracts betting that the euro will drop now represent 46 per cent of all open interest, at more than $127bn.“While we have pencilled in further euro weakness in our latest forecasts, stretched positioning may limit the downside,” said Sverre Holbek, senior analyst at Danske Bank, adding that a broad rally in European equities was helping to prop up the single currency during a light trading session.“But there are still concerns about the sovereign debt crisis. Spain’s budget deficit underlines the near-term risks, and traders are awaiting the results of a French auction later this week,” Mr Holbek said.Meanwhile, China’s PMI survey showed activity rising to expansion levels, above the key 50 mark at 50.3. That topped a consensus forecast of 49.1, thanks to surprising strength in external demand for Chinese goods.India’s PMI, as measured by HSBC and Markit, rose to 54.2 in December, its highest level in six months.The figures boosted commodity-linked currencies as traders embraced riskier notes. The Canadian dollar added 0.2 per cent to C$1.0195 against its US counterpart, the New Zealand dollar rose 0.1 per cent to $0.7781 and the Australian dollar added 0.1 per cent to $1.0222.But the South Korean won was among the laggards, falling 0.3 per cent to Won1,155.86 versus the dollar. HSBC’s South Korean manufacturing survey fell in December to its lowest level since February 2009.
706;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2012-01-02T13:24:49Z;India PMI: good news, but not good enough;;"Manufacturing in India picked up in December on the back of a rise in new orders, a brighter note amongst other Asian economies’ data.According to PMI figures released by HSBC and Markit, December’s 54.2, up from 51.0 in November, was comfortably above the 50 benchmark that separates growth from contraction and represented the highest monthly rise since April 2009. The question now is: when will India start to bring interest rates down?Economists said the higher number was a sign that things were perhaps not quite as bad as recent disappointing GDP growth and IP data had suggested, but that it would not be enough to cause the Reserve Bank of India to begin reversing immediately the monetary policy tightening cycle it has been in engaged in since March 2010 just yet.While RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao told the BBC on Monday, “From here on we could expect reversal of monetary tightening,” he added that it was “difficult to say when that will take place and in what shape it will roll out”.The bank had paused on interest rates at its December meeting as it became clear, with GDP growth down below 7 per cent for the quarter ending in September – its slowest rate in more than two years – that monetary tightening was taking its toll on growth.Monday’s figures were driven by a rise in output and new orders – “the latter was partly led by a pick up in overseas demand, with export orders rising at a faster clip (54.1 vs. 50.4 in November)”, according to HSBC.This from Leif Eskesen, India economist for HSBC:The latest PMI survey brings some relief with regards to growth. The momentum, it seems, is at least stronger than suggested by the official and more dated industrial production data.The December survey shows that domestic demand is providing solid support for activity on the ground. Moreover, the rise in overseas orders suggests that conditions for export oriented industries are maybe not quite as dire as feared.As beyondbrics reported, government data released last month revealed that the India’s once-robust industrial production had shrunk a staggering 5.1 per cent in October, the biggest contraction since March 2009.But HSBC’s December numbers painted a slightly rosier picture: total new orders rose to 57.9 from 50.4 in November, while output stood at 55.8, up from 50.5 in November.Employment in the sector, meanwhile, jumped to 50.4, versus 48.6 in November, the first growth figure for the category in five months.But, alas, it wasn’t all good news: inflation readings, according to HSBC, were “not encouraging”, with input price increases barely easing to 62.7 from 63.1 in November, and output prices rising to 56.2 from 55.4 in November.With those figures in mind, and the fact that inflation remained above 9 per cent in November, the RBI can’t switch its priority to growth immediately, according to Eskesen:As for the RBI, the numbers suggest it is too early to replace inflation with growth as the key policy concern. The strength in demand is continuing to provide firms with the ability to pass on cost increases and at an accelerated pace. A rate cut is, consequently, not just around the corner. There first have to be clear signs that core inflation pressures, and not just headline, is moving in the right direction on a sustained basis.Jairaj Pudandare, former regional managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told beyondbrics that while he didn’t expect a rate cut at January’s policy meeting, he wouldn’t be surprised to see it in the first quarter of 2012.“The fact is that the cost of funds have gone up so much [due to high inflation and a weak rupee] it’s difficult to do business,” he said. “So over the next 9-to-12 months we’ll see that reversed and I think the RBI will take steps in the next two or three months [to begin the reversal process].”Meanwhile, Subbarao seemed to give the central bank a wide enough window in which any reversal might take place, saying, “I think the balance between growth and inflation will shift in 2012.”Related reading:

707;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-12-23T13:06:43Z;Drop in services output stokes stagnation fear;;Fears that UK growth may have ground to a halt, or worse, in the final quarter have been heightened by a sharp fall in services output over the course of October.Office for National Statistics data showed services output had fallen by 0.7 per cent between September and October.The monthly data are volatile and often get heavily revised. But if the last three months are taken into account, the performance of the sector, which accounts for 76 per cent of UK GDP, has been dismal.In the three months to October, output in the sector grew 0.2 per cent, against a 0.7 per cent increase in the third quarter, when services were one of the main drivers of higher-than-forecast growth.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the data added to the picture of economic stagnation.“With manufacturing struggling in the face of weakened global demand for goods, and service providers hit by slumping business and consumer confidence at home, the UK recovery is looking increasingly fragile.”The decline was blamed on weaknesses in transport, storage and communication services, which dropped by 2.5 per cent. Business services and finance performed poorly, dipping by 0.7 per cent.Worryingly, the biggest boost came from government. “Government spend should weaken in the coming months as budget cuts hit, taking this prop away from the economy,” Mr Williamson said.Meanwhile, the British Bankers’ Association reported that unsecured borrowing shrank by 1.2 per cent in the year to November, and personal deposits rose by 2.7 per cent.Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: “Consumer desire to get a tight grip on their finances is clearly the consequence of heightened concerns over the outlook for the economy and jobs.”At £8.2bn, gross mortgage lending was slightly stronger than in October and 5 per cent higher than in November 2010.
708;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-12-22T15:25:14Z;Sterling fails to get lift from higher GDP;;"The pound barely twitched after the final revision to third-quarter UK growth revealed an unexpected tick higher.Sterling rose 0.1 per cent to $1.5683 following the data that revised gross domestic product in the July-
September period higher to 0.6 per cent from 0.5 per cent, thanks to stronger output from the services and construction sectors. It finished the session fractionally lower at $1.5663.The pound was restrained by a further revision to second-quarter GDP. This showed activity in the April-June period was flat after previous readings suggested a rise of 0.1 per cent.Analysts remained concerned about the prospects for growth in the UK in 2012. Many forecast a dip back into recession, the technical definition of which is two-successive quarters of contracting economic activity.“The data available so far suggest that the economy probably stagnated in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the Bank of England’s current estimates,” said Chris Williamson, of Markit.There was a “growing likelihood of a slide back into recession in the new year”, he added.Sterling was up 0.1 per cent to Y122.39 versus the yen but remained flat at £0.8321 against the euro.The euro was similarly bogged down as investors steered clear of risk in the penultimate trading session before the Christmas break.Wednesday’s results of the European Central Bank’s three-year liquidity operation were only providing scant support as investors began to close their books on a turbulent year. “Next year will be the crunch year for the euro-zone,” said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics. “Either policymakers will step up their efforts and produce the much-promised policy ‘bazooka’, or the crisis will come to a head and the eurozone will cease to exist in its current form.”The single currency was down 0.1 per cent to $1.3039 versus the dollar and 0.1 per cent higher at Y101.96 versus the yen. The euro climbed 0.2 per cent to SFr1.2227 against the Swiss franc.Recent losses for gold prices have left the South African rand vulnerable in the past few weeks but it has rallied this week and was up 0.8 per cent versus the dollar at R8.1075 as exporter flows helped lift the currency."
709;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-12-19T00:05:35Z;Households will curb spending, says Bank;;Hard-hit households will continue to rein in spending over the coming year on fears that the government’s fiscal retrenchment will lead to a loss of income or unemployment, according to Bank of England research.Households, struggling with high inflation and low wage growth, have reined in spending over the past 12 months with the resulting fall in consumption seen as one of the key factors behind the poor performance of the British economy.In the Bank’s quarterly bulletin, the results of a poll on the financial position of British households conducted by NMG Consulting show that fiscal consolidation has also had a marked impact. Some 15 per cent of households say that they had saved more this year than they would have done otherwise because of the cuts, against 7 per cent which said they had spent more.That trend looks set to become more pronounced in 2012, with almost a quarter, or 24 per cent, saying they expect to save more over the course of next year because of the fiscal consolidation. Those saying they would look for other jobs accounted for 23 per cent, and 22 per cent planned to work longer hours because of the measures. Only 3 per cent said they would spend more.Households overall did not expect to save more over the coming year due to lower income and the higher cost of essentials.Monetary policy has cushioned the squeeze on households’ income. The Bank’s benchmark rate, which at 0.5 per cent is at its lowest level in Threadneedle Street’s 317-year history, has helped by contributing to the low cost of financing mortgage rates and other loans.The results also suggest that forbearance had also limited financial stress, with 12 per cent of homeowners benefiting from some kind of renegotiation or relaxation of the terms of a loan.The poll of 2,000 households, conducted in late September, presents a gloomy picture of household finances.“The survey suggests that the environment facing households remains challenging. Incomes were reported to have fallen and the outlook for them was relatively uncertain,” the Bank said.This grim outlook is echoed by Markit household finance index for December, published on Monday.The index dropped from 34.6 for November to 34.3, its lowest level in four months, on the back of a sharp rise in debt and a fall in incomes. A figure below 50 signals a deterioration.The rise in household debt is the sharpest since the survey began in February 2009 and the fall in income the steepest since March 2009.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said “weak labour market conditions, ongoing austerity measures and heightened inflationary pressures” had led to the deterioration in households’ finances.Almost half of those polled said they expected their finances to deteriorate further over the next 12 months.Mr Moore said: “A fall-back in inflation will help alleviate pressure on household finances next year, but consumer sentiment looks set to remain subdued by a lack of income growth.”
710;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Eurozone economic contraction eases;;The pace of the eurozone’s economic contraction eased this month, with Germany’s expanding private sector preventing the region from plunging deeper into recession, according to a closely-watched survey.Eurozone purchasing managers’ indices rebounded unexpectedly in December for a second consecutive month, suggesting some of the gloom about the region’s prospects had been overdone. Germany saw private sector activity returning to growth.Economic activity across the 17-country region in the fourth quarter had still contracted sharply, however, with the average index reading in the last three months of 2011 the weakest since the second quarter of 2009.The indices also failed to dispel fears that the eurozone’s debt crisis and weakened banking system will exacerbate the sharp downturn in much of southern Europe in coming months. Fiscal austerity measures across the continent will act as further brake on growth.Beyond Germany and France, “the rate of contraction remained steep – the fastest since mid-2009 – and a further slump in business confidence led to another sharp drop in employment,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey. The latest eurozone readings were consistent with a 0.6 per cent quarterly contraction in gross domestic product, he estimated.The purchasing managers’ indices are regarded as up-to-date indicators of trends in economic activity. The composite eurozone index, covering manufacturing and services, rose from 47 in November to 47.9 in December. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.Germany’s composite index rose from 49.4 in November to 51.3, powered largely by a pick up in service sector activity.“We think it would be premature to say that the leading indicators have reached a turning point,” said Ralph Solveen, economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “The most likely scenario…is still that the eurozone economy will contract in the months ahead.” The European Central Bank has forecast a “mild recession” but warned of “substantial downside risks” to the economic outlook.
711;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-12-02T12:18:55Z;Construction buoyed by rise in house building;;The first pick-up in house building for six months and a stronger rise in new orders meant construction activity continued to expand in November, according to a closely watched survey, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index registered 52.3 in November, down from 53.9 in October. A figure above 50 signals an expansion in activity.House building rose in November, for the first time since May. New business orders also rose by the fastest pace in six months. The expansion in employment activity was the largest since March 2008.Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: “It’s a relief in the current environment to see any evidence that part of the economy is growing.”George Buckley of Deutsche Bank said: “We can take heart that it doesn’t look as though we’re going to see a contraction on the scale seen in 2008 and 2009.”Construction contributes 6 per cent to UK gross domestic product. Mr Buckley said: “While it’s good news, it’s not great news because it’s a sector that contributes relatively little.”Official data have, however, told a different, gloomier, story than the construction PMIs.Though the PMIs have registered an expansion in construction activity throughout this year, Office for National Statistics data show that output in the third quarter fell by 0.2 per cent.Philip Rush of Nomura said: “The conflicting messages from the construction PMI and the official data masks the true current health of the sector.”Analysts warned that the positive readings recorded in recent months might not continue.Mr Rush said: “The headwinds are so strong, it is hard to be optimistic on the outlook for the construction sector, even with the infrastructure measures announced in the autumn statement.”
712;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-12-01T18:42:03Z;Global output picture worsens;;The fortunes of the world’s manufacturers diverged last month as factories in the US churned out goods at a decent pace while those in Asia, particularly China, and Europe grappled with deteriorating conditions.The global picture is worsening slightly for manufacturers as the eurozone crisis seeps from financial markets into the real economy, but conditions are neither as bad nor as uniform as in the dark days of 2008 and 2009.Markit’s global purchasing managers’ index survey – which pulls together the data from a number of national surveys – fell slightly from 49.9 in October to 49.6 in November. These numbers indicate broadly stagnant activity. In contrast, the index fell to about 35 at the nadir of the downturn.Beneath the aggregate figures, manufacturing growth in the US– the world’s biggest economy – helped to offset contracting output in China, Europe and the UK. “The US does seem to be showing some signs of life again but the rest of the world is falling deeper into potentially another downturn,” Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said.US manufacturers reported their strongest rise in new orders for seven months in an Institute for Supply Management report that suggested a summer lull in activity was over. The new orders component rose by four points to 56.7 while the overall PMI index for November rose by two points to 52.7.Analysts noted the two-point rise in the export orders component of PMI to 52 with some surprise, given the slowdown in the country’s biggest trading partners. “This is one indication that if contagion from Europe can be largely contained to trade flows rather than financial contagion, the US economy can remain relatively resilient,” noted Alan Ruskin at Deutsche Bank in New York.The strong overall numbers were driven by primary production industries such as oil, gas, coal, food and paper. The US is enjoying a boom in energy production as it taps into previously unexploited reserves of gas trapped in shale rocks. The one disappointment was a two-point fall in the employment component of ISM as companies continue to squeeze out higher productivity, rather than hire workers to produce more.Conditions in the rest of the world were much bleaker. Indeed, production outside the US fell at the steepest pace for more than two-and-a-half years. Chinese manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in almost three years in November. In the eurozone, the purchasing managers’ indices confirmed that manufacturing activity in the region contracted for a fourth consecutive month. The fastest rates of contraction were in Greece, Spain and Italy.Meanwhile, manufacturers in the UK – which are very exposed to what happens in Europe – saw output contract for the second successive month. Manufacturing growth helped pull the UK economy out of recession but policymakers’ hopes the sector would help to “rebalance” the economy have been disappointed.“It looks like it’s going to be a bleak winter for UK manufacturers with the PMI showing very little to be positive about at the moment,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.Worryingly for the broader British economy, the PMI’s employment sub-index dropped from 49.6 to 46, which suggests manufacturers are now cutting jobs at the fastest rate for two years.Asian economies are also feeling the eurozone’s chill. China grabbed the attention on Thursday but manufacturers are struggling in Japan too and PMI surveys show output contracting in South Korea and Taiwan.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins
713;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;S&P downgrades banks under new model;;Large international banks from Bank of America to Barclays suffered credit rating downgrades from Standard & Poor’s on Tuesday, putting pressure on their funding costs at a time of strain in the financial system.S&P said it reviewed the ratings of 37 of the largest global financial institutions under a new model that gives more weight to the economic and systemwide funding risks of individual countries. Seven of eight US banks were downgraded.BofA, which was downgraded from A to A-, said earlier this month that a one-notch ratings cut could force it to post $5.1bn of additional collateral against trades. Other banks are likely to face similar pressure.However, on pure funding costs, Citigroup said less than 1 per cent of its funding would be affected. The bank added that it “completely disagree[d]” with the S&P change and it did “not accurately reflect the significant progress Citi has made over the last three years”.The downgrades were announced after the market closed, muting their impact. S&P has also been talking to investors for weeks about its planned methodology changes. But shares in BofA, the second-largest US bank by assets, traded briefly below $5 after its downgrade was published.The cost of default protection on large US banks was higher all day, with only a modest move higher after the S&P announcement itself, said Otis Casey, director of credit research at Markit, the data tracker. Credit default swaps on BofA rose 21 basis points to 480bp from Monday’s close. That means dealers were demanding $480,000 a year to insure $10m of Bank of America bonds for five years. Morgan Stanley CDS is the most expensive of the large US banks at 503bp, up 4bp on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley saw its ratings downgraded from A to A- as part of the S&P review. “I don’t see this as life-threatening by itself but it’s an indicator of broader pressures,” said Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA Securities.Not all 37 banks were downgraded. Twenty banks including BNP Paribas remained stable while China Construction Bank received an upgrade. Rabobank, the Dutch lender, was the only institution to receive a double-notch downgradeSeparately on Tuesday, Moody’s placed the junior bonds of 87 European banks on review for downgrade, as the rating agency phases out government support for the lenders’ debt from its ratings methodology.
714;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
715;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-23T22:35:30Z;US bank credit default swaps jump;;Investors paid record amounts to protect themselves against the risk of default by Bank of America on Wednesday, as fears grow over US banks’ exposure to the eurozone debt crisis.Credit default swaps on BofA, a form of protection against default, rose as high as 495 basis points – or $495,000 a year to insure $10m of BofA debt over five years, according to Markit, the data provider. That compares with the previous high of 456bp on October 4 and a recent low of 300bp in late October.In early October, the cost of default protection on US banks had surged to levels not seen since the period around the 2008-09 financial crisis as investors worried Europe’s sovereign debt crisis would infect the US financial system.Efforts to resolve the region’s problems initially helped to allay those fears. But CDS prices, for BofA and other large US financial institutions, have been steadily rising again in the past few weeks.“There is again broad risk-averse sentiment stemming from Europe,” said Otis Casey, an analyst at Markit. “We still don’t have a solution there.”CDS protection on European financials also rose to fresh highs on Wednesday. The Markit iTraxx Senior Financials, tied to the senior debt of 25 European banks and insurers, rose 22bp to reach 341bp on Wednesday.Italian banks were among the hardest hit, with CDS levels reaching “stratospheric” levels, according to Markit’s Mr Casey. Protection on UniCredit, Italy’s biggest lender, rose 43bp to 622bp, a fresh record. CDS on Intesa Sanpaolo rose 57bp to 580bp, while CDS on Banco Popolare jumped 63bp to 925bp.On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said it would force the biggest US banks to “stress test” their balance sheets against a severe eurozone recession and a US unemployment rate of 13 per cent. Mr Casey said the sharp declines in bank share prices this year, particularly for BofA, would make it more difficult to raise capital, if needed.Shares in BofA are down by more than 60 per cent in 2011, while Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have lost more than 50 per cent. Goldman Sachs is down by more than 40 per cent.While concerns about exposure to Europe have dominated discussions about bank risk globally, BofA suffers from domestic problems from the financial crisis in the form of so-called “toxic” assets and litigation related to allegations of improper lending and packaging of US mortgage securities.Signs of broader stress across US financials have also been flagged by three-month dollar Libor, the interbank lending rate, rising to its highest setting since July 2010. The benchmark reference rate for banks lending to each other rose to 0.50611 per cent on Wednesday, double this year’s low of 0.2450 per cent set in June.Another barometer of bank counterparty risk, two-year interest rate swap spreads rose to their highest level this week since May 2010. Swaps reflect the credit quality of banks that trade the derivative and widen over Treasury yields during periods of banking stress.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway

Any sign of cracks must add to fear that the overall European situation is quickly deteriorating with a knock-on effect for US stocks.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 2.1 per cent to 11,257.63, with all 30 members in the red. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.4 per cent to 2,460.08.The financial sector of the S&P 500 declined 3 per cent after the Federal Reserve added to pressure on US banks by announcing that it would stress test their ability to withstand unemployment of 13 per cent and a 6.9 per cent fall in eurozone GDP.At one point Bank of America fell to $5.11, it lowest price since March 2009, before closing at $5.14, a loss of 4.3 per cent for the day.The cost of default protection on BofA debt rose 35 basis points to 472bp, an all-time record according to data from Markit. That equates to $472,000 a year to insure $10m of BofA debt for five years.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.03, Citigroup tumbled 3.9 per cent to $23.51 and JPMorgan was off 3.5 per cent to $28.38.Goldman Sachs held the steadiest among the big US banks, off 1.7 per cent to $87.89, but that still left the bank set for its worst close since March 2009.Even Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden conceded that the stress tests would leave big banks in the crosshairs.“We view the test as more onerous for large banks, as regulators appear focused on stressing capital markets (Europe and counterparty) exposures,” he wrote to clients.Smaller lenders were not immune, with the Fed also announcing that all banks with assets more than $50bn must submit a capital adequacy plan by January 2012. Regions Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $3.68.Oppenheimer waded into the debate over liquidity at Jefferies, the New York-based investment bank whose exposures to Europe and funding stability have been much scrutinised.Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said notes from bond research firm Egan-Jones, calling on Jefferies to reduce assets and raise capital, were “plain wrong”.Jefferies shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.51.Materials and energy stocks suffered as eurozone sentiment translated into fears for global growth.Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources fell 6.7 per cent to $19.27 and US Steel Corp was down 7.6 per cent to $22.41.JPMorgan told clients to have an underweight position for the entire commodities sector after the failure of the US budget “supercommittee”.“Policy failures in the US and Europe have darkened the six-month outlook,” Colin Fenton wrote to clients. “We expect outright total return losses near-term and see greater value in bonds.”Highly cyclical semiconductor stocks also suffered with the Philadelphia Sox index falling 2.5 per cent, led down by Jabil Circuit, which was off 8.6 per cent to $18.36.Groupon fell below its IPO price of $20 for the first time since its debut two weeks ago. Its shares were down 15.6 per cent to $16.96. That meant a third consecutive daily fall of more than 10 per cent, even though investors have been unable to initiate new short positions since Monday.Boston Scientific was one of a handful of stocks in the S&P 500 to record gains. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $5.32 after the medical device maker received regulatory approval for a new version of its drug-coated heart stent.Shares in the pharmacy chain Walgreen shares were up 4.4 per cent to $32.09 on reports that it may be able to salvage a deal to fill prescriptions for pharmacy benefit management company Express Scripts.Strong earnings from John Deere also provided some cheer as the world’s biggest tractor maker easily exceeded analysts’ expectations with earnings per share of $1.62 in the quarter to the end of October. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $74.72.But any hopes that US fundamentals might detract from eurozone woes were dashed by a flurry of downbeat pre-Thanksgiving economic data. Unemployment claims ticked up while consumer spending grinding almost to a halt in October.
717;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-23T12:08:38Z;Eurozone industry contraction speeds up;;Eurozone industry saw the biggest one month fall in orders in almost three years in September, as worries about the region’s escalating debt crisis hit demand.New orders plunged by 6.4 per cent compared with August, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office. It was the biggest month-on-month fall since December 2008, when the global economy was reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank. Then, orders dropped by 10.2 per cent.The data suggested the region’s debt crisis had undermined economic confidence even more than feared, resulting in business and consumers cutting back investment and spending. Earlier this week, the European Commission reported its index of eurozone consumer confidence had fallen in November for the fifth consecutive month to the lowest level since August 2009.With orders data providing an early indication of trends in economic activity, September’s figures added to evidence that the eurozone has fallen into recession. Italy, where the eurozone debt crisis intensified from August, saw the biggest drop in industrial orders – of 9.2 per cent – between August and September. But France and Spain saw drop of 6.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively, and Germany saw a 4.4 per cent contraction in orders.Eurozone purchasing managers’ indices for November, also published on Wednesday, indicated overall economic activity is contracting at a significant pace – although the rate of decline appeared to have stabilised. The “composite” index, covering manufacturing and services, rose from 46.5 in October to 47.2 – the third consecutive month below the 50 level, which divides an expansion in activity from a contraction.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey, said the latest readings were consistent with the eurozone economy contracting at a quarterly rate of 0.6 per cent. “Malaise has spread from the [eurozone] ‘periphery’ to the core. Even Germany is stagnating and France contracting by around 0.5 per cent,” he said.The latest gloomy data are likely to fuel expectations that the European Central Bank will cut its main interest rate again at its December meeting. At his first meeting as ECB president earlier this month, Mario Draghi announced a cut from 1.5 per cent and 1.25 per cent and predicted a “mild recession” by the end of the year.With the eurozone debt crisis increasing the strains on the region’s banks, the ECB could also announce fresh help with the provision of liquidity.
718;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-22T13:21:08Z;UK public borrowing falls in October;;"Britain remains on track to meet this year’s public borrowing targets, but the bleak economic situation has pushed the government’s longer-term plan to reduce the deficit off course.The government borrowed a net £6.5bn in October, excluding various financial interventions, compared with the £7.7bn it borrowed in the same month last year, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics also revised down some of its estimates of public borrowing for previous months.“The data we had today were encouraging for how well the Treasury can do in troubling conditions,” Philip Rush, the UK economist at Nomura, said. “But ultimately we need to see more growth than we’re likely to get over the next couple of years in order to meet the [deficit reduction] target.”So far this year, the government has borrowed £68.3bn; this compares with the £78.7bn it had borrowed at this point last year, and keeps the government roughly on target to meet its full-year borrowing forecast.Most of the improvement has come from cuts to public investment, meaning the government has struggled to improve the current budget deficit, its long-term target measure, by as much.In addition, as the FT reported on Monday, David Cameron, the prime minister, has received bleak official forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that show the government is behind schedule on its plan to scrap the structural deficit by 2015-16. The OBR is expected to say the scope for rapid growth in the next few years is lower than it thought.October’s figures on the public finances will offer some solace, though. Central government spending remained very restrained, up about 1 per cent on the same month a year ago. So far this year the government has spent less than the OBR was expecting, though the fiscal watchdog said this could unwind later in the year, a period when government departments tend to increase their rate of spending.Meanwhile total government tax receipts rose by about 4 per cent last month on a year ago. Receipts have increased by slightly less than the OBR expected so far this year and corporate tax receipts were disappointing in October, down by almost 7 per cent on the same month a year earlier. Over the year as a whole, the OBR had forecast corporation tax revenue would grow by 14.2 per cent.The OBR said the fall in October was due to lower receipts from the financial sector amid falling profits in the banking sector. Receipts from oil and gas companies also rose less than expected due to production shut-downs earlier in the year.Rowena Crawford, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “October is a big month for corporation tax receipts so today’s figures . . . will be disappointing for Mr Osborne as he prepares for next week’s autumn statement.”Public debt continues to rise. In October, public sector net debt was £966.6bn or about 62 per cent of gross domestic product. In the same month last year, it was £836.8bn or about 56 per cent of GDP."
719;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-18T16:33:56Z;Construction sector growth stalls in September;;The construction sector has stopped growing and new orders have started to fall, according to a closely watched survey that comes as monetary policymakers consider whether to inject more money into the economy.The Markit purchasing managers’ index fell from 52.6 in August to 50.1 in September. Any number above 50 indicates an increase in activity, according to Markit.“Delayed and cancelled projects, more competitive tendering and general uncertainty over economic conditions are putting a dampener on things,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.The construction sector only accounts for about 6 per cent of gross domestic product but it can often sway overall GDP figures because activity tends to be volatile. The weak numbers follow a surprisingly positive survey of the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 13 per cent of GDP.The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will decide later this week whether to create more money to pump into the economy through the purchase of government bonds. Most economists think the decision could go either way.Commercial construction activity increased last month for the 19th month in a row but there was a decline in activity on housing and civil engineering projects. Economists said the latter were suffering amid government austerity measures: recent data from the Office of National Statistics suggested new orders for public housing and public works projects fell by a third between the first and second quarters of the year.The PMI sub-index for new orders dropped to the lowest since February 2010. Sarah Bingham, an economist at Markit, said the decline in new business “bodes ill for construction activity in the coming months.”However, construction companies hired slightly more workers and were fairly positive about their prospects over the next year. In addition, inflationary pressures subsided substantially: the input price sub-index fell from 68 in August to 59 in September.Separately, figures from accountancy firm Deloitte showed that the number of property and construction companies falling into administration in the third quarter of this year increased by 11 per cent to 117, compared with 105 in the same period last year.Nigel Shilton, real estate industry partner at Deloitte, said: “The property and construction sectors have been two sectors hardest hit by the current economic uncertainty.” He added that the next quarter would continue to be tough for the construction sector and would particularly hit medium-sized firms as opposed to the big national contractors.

The New York-based investment bank, which is a market-maker in Italian government bonds, spent last week battling to reassure investors about its exposure to eurozone debt.Morgan Stanley fell 9 per cent to $15.76, once again suffering more than other big US banks, as filings showed it had recently carried $1.79bn in net exposure to Italy, after hedges.Goldman Sachs was off 8.2 per cent to $99.67 after the bank said it had $2.3bn of exposure to the Italian government, of which all but $700m is hedged, generally with investment-grade counterparties.Among the commercial banks, Citigroup fell 8.2 per cent to $28.85 and Bank of America was off 5.7 per cent to $6.16.Credit default swaps on US banks also moved upwards on Wednesday. The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose 50 basis points to 445bp, according to data from Markit. That equates to $445,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years, but is still well off the 584bp seen at the start of October.The S&P 500 closed at 1,229.1, down 3.7 per cent for its worst daily performance in three months, and decisively back into negative territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.9 per cent to 2,621.65, in negative territory for the year for the first time in more than a week.General Motors, plunged 10.9 per cent to $22.31 after the Detroit carmaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.7bn, 15 per cent lower than the same period last year, and said it would not break even in Europe this year.Software maker Adobe Systems was down 7.7 per cent to $28.08 after the company cut its 2012 revenue forecast and said it would axe 750 jobs at a cost of up to $78m in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company is to reduce its focus on enterprise software for governments and businesses, and stop adapting its Flash Player software for mobile devices and tablets, calling time on a long battle to persuade the likes of Apple to adopt Flash.“A year ago Adobe would have said Flash was critical to the company’s future,” said Chris Hickey, software analyst at Atlantic Equities, from Adobe’s analyst day in New York. “But Flash-specific products only make up a small percentage of revenues, and I think the sell-off in the stock is overdone.”All 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down – an alarming sign of stocks moving in lockstep in response to macro news from Europe.The blue chip-heavy index fell 3.2 per cent to 11,780.87, with China-exposed stocks among the biggest fallers. Alcoa was down 5.4 per cent to $10.20 and Caterpillar fell 4.4 per cent to $91.64, as fears grew that the eurozone crisis is leading banks to tighten lending in Asia.Hewlett-Packard fell 5.4 per cent to $26.33 after a conference call with Meg Whitman, chief executive, failed to clarify whether the company plans to sell its webOS platform.A sale of the software, which was purchased from Palm for $1.2bn in 2010 to run on HP’s failed tablet offering, would probably mean the company accepting a loss.Computer Sciences Corp plunged 15.4 per cent to $27.90 after slashing its full fiscal year earnings forecast to a range of $4.05 to $4.10 a share. It had predicted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 per share in August.The IT outsourcing company is heavily dependent on US government contracts, and blamed “federal budget uncertainty”, for its lowered guidance.Best Buy was the only stock in the S&P 500 to record gains. It rose 1.4 per cent to $27.22 after Cleveland Research said its survey of individual stores indicated same-store sales growth was positive in October.Groupon executives may be relieved at the timing of last week’s initial public offering, which priced at $20. The stock fell another 3.5 per cent on Wednesday, and is down 7.7 per cent for the week at $24.02, after popping up to $29.52 on its debut last week.
721;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK trade deficit widens in September;;The UK’s trade deficit widened in September as imports rose and exports stagnated, highlighting how difficult it is proving for the economy to export its way back to health.The total trade deficit rose from £2.7bn in August to £3.9bn in September, according to the Office for National Statistics, while the goods deficit widened from £8.6bn to £9.8bn.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: “With domestic demand hit by deficit-fighting austerity measures and export sales falling, it is hard to see what will drive economic growth in coming months, raising the risk of a double-dip recession.”Economists tend to treat the monthly trade data with caution, however, because they are notoriously volatile and often subsequently revised.Exports of goods rose less than 0.2 per cent as higher exports of cars and oil were offset by lower exports of chemicals, intermediate goods (part-finished items and parts) and consumer goods.Policymakers had hoped the 20 per cent devaluation of sterling on a trade-weighted basis would spur a sharp rise in exports and help to close the trade deficit.However, the performance of exports has been disappointing, and recently compounded by the escalating crisis in the eurozone, which is the UK’s biggest trade partner. Exports to European Union countries fell by about £600m in September.“Taken at face value the September data are rather worrying as they suggest the anticipated rebalancing of the UK’s trade position is far from materialising,” said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays Capital.Several closely watched surveys of the manufacturing sector have suggested the export picture worsened considerably in October as output and new orders began to decline.Economists were puzzled by a 1.6 per cent rise in the volume of imports in September, given the weak domestic economy. The rise in imports of goods was driven by increased purchases of chemicals, oil and silver.Meanwhile, the surplus on trade in services remained steady at £5.9bn as a slight fall in imports was matched by a similar fall in exports.
722;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-03T00:57:15Z;Markit acquires equities data group;Move to help bring analysis to over-the-counter markets;Markit, the over-the-counter market data and services provider, is branching further into the exchange-traded world, acquiring an equities data group that it hopes can bridge the gap between the two marketplaces.Reforms such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or Emir, review aim to move over-the-counter trading in swaps on to central electronic markets. That is prompting a whirlwind of change, as dealers, technology providers and traders aim to secure their place in the market.One of the key questions is whether the new trading venues, called Swap Execution Facilities, or SEFs in the US, will make trading more decentralised, or whether they will be aggregated by market makers and algorithms, much as how fragmented equity markets are connected.Markit on Wednesday said it had agreed to terms with Quantitative Services Group, which analyses electronic stock trading strategies. The aim, Markit said, was to bring that analysis to over-the-counter markets and also to add Markit’s existing data on credit derivatives to equity trading models.“We see opportunities in the OTC markets to apply those same skills and capabilities,” said Armins Rusis, global head of data, indices and research at Markit.“While we don’t believe OTC markets will follow the exact same path as equity markets, we are seeing some of the same structures emerge in places like foreign exchange, credit indices and interest rate swaps,” he said.A recent report by the Tabb Group found that in a survey of the largest dealers of swaps, 90 per cent believed that profits would stay flat or decline in the first year of implementation of the new rules, which are expected to be finalised in 2012.At the same time, the number of swap market participants is expected to grow sharply, as dozens of new players enter the space and groups ranging from interdealer brokers to trading screen providers launch SEF markets. Businesses such as Markit may face increasing competition as market data on standardised products is more easily disseminated.However, various surveys have also suggested that existing participants, especially the largest dealers, may retain their key roles by becoming bridges between different markets and see relatively higher margins because they have to make fewer technology investments.“Existing swap dealers will see an erosion in profits but still have the incumbent advantage based on existing relationships and technology expertise,” said analysts at Celent in a recent report. “Executing brokers already have much of the connectivity in place and are expected to have a less complicated task ahead of them.”“Our belief is that pockets of liquidity will form larger pools of liquidity,” said Mr Rusis at Markit. “That’s not to suggest there will be a single pool of liquidity like with an exchange, or that all products will have equal liquidity. But those that do will be capable of having disciplines like factor analysis or transaction cost analysis applied.”
723;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-11-02T11:24:16Z;Surprise pick up in construction activity;;"The UK construction industry enjoyed rising activity and new orders last month; a rare piece of good news that suggests the economy is not suffering uniformly.The purchasing managers’ index for the sector rose from 50.9 in September to 53.9 in October – the highest reading in five months – as work picked up on commercial building and civil engineering projects. House building activity declined for the fifth month in a row, but at a much slower pace than before.Economists were surprised by the strong survey data, which came a day after the manufacturing PMI for October dropped to worryingly low levels and prompted some to warn the UK economy could be heading for another recession.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey was a “welcome and all too rare” positive surprise for the economy. However, he cautioned against reading too much into one month’s data. The construction sector only accounts for about 6 per cent of gross domestic product, though its volatility means it can often have an outsized influence on the overall rate of economic growth.The construction survey’s sub-index for new orders rose from 49.35 in September to 53.99 in October while the quantity of purchases also rose. Construction companies also took on more staff, albeit only at a tentative rate.However, the sub-index for business expectations dropped to its lowest level since December 2008. Markit, the company that compiled the survey, said respondents were uncertain about the continued strength of private sector demand, and about the effects of public spending cuts. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said this suggested “the sector could slide back into recession unless confidence revives in coming months”.In addition, input price inflation picked up again after hitting a ten-month low in September. Survey respondents cited higher fuel and raw material costs; some also mentioned an end to fixed-price agreements.The week’s mixed messages will make a similar survey of the services sector, to be released on Thursday, even more important for those trying to discern where the economy is headed. This sector accounts for more than three quarters of GDP and its robust performance in the three months to September helped the economy to grow by 0.5 per cent."
724;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-24T21:39:28Z;Pressure grows on ECB to cut interest rates;;Eurozone economic activity contracted this month at the fastest pace for more than two years, according to a closely watched survey that will increase pressure on the European Central Bank to cut its main interest rate, writes Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt.The sharper than expected fall in eurozone purchasing managers’ indices adds to evidence that the 17-country region is tumbling into recession, with the escalating debt crisis casting an increasingly dark cloud over the region’s prospects.“The uncertainty provoked by the sovereign debt crisis has reached danger point,” warned Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.The main “composite” index, covering manufacturing and service industries, fell from 49.1 in September to 47.2, the lowest since July 2009, when the region was still recovering from the global slowdown triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It was the second month running that the index was below 50, which divides an expansion from a contraction in activity.With the survey providing an up-to-date guide to growth trends, the latest reading “signals a heightened risk of the eurozone sliding back into recession”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey. Not only the crisis-hit eurozone “periphery” economies were contracting, he pointed out. French private sector activity also declined in October “led by a worryingly steep deterioration in the service sector”, as did German manufacturing activity, which had spearheaded the region’s recovery.Peter Vanden Houte, European economist at ING in Brussels, said: “The snail-like progress in the resolution of the European debt crisis is unlikely to alter this picture soon.”With the survey also showing inflation pressures had abated significantly, the results strengthened the case for the ECB cutting its main interest rate possibly as early as its meeting next week – the first to be chaired by Mario Draghi, who takes over from Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB president a few days earlier.
725;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-23T23:03:04Z;Families’ money worries worsen;;Households are more worried about their financial prospects than at any time in the past six months, as they struggle to contend with soaring prices and falling job security, says research published on Monday.Almost 37 per cent of homes saw their financial situation worsen in October, while only 7 per cent experienced an improvement, according to the Household Finance Index compiled by Markit, the financial information company.This deterioration, which continues the fall seen in September, has fed through into an increasingly pessimistic outlook, with the index measuring households’ financial expectations falling from 42.2 in August to 34.5 in October, the lowest level since April 2011 and well below the figure of 50, which implies an overall improvement.Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: “Household finances were once again gripped in a vice of subdued real incomes and heightened job insecurity in October. Weak labour market conditions, combined with elevated inflationary pressures, have made rising debt and falling willingness to spend recurring themes this year.”Figures released last week showed that consumer price inflation surged to 5.2 per cent in September, a level that has not been surpassed since the series began in 1997, as rising utility bills, in particular, hit consumers hard.Meanwhile the labour market, which had held up better than expected in the wake of the 2008-09 recession, has begun to deteriorate. Unemployment has reached its highest level since 1994, with private sector job creation unable to offset job losses in the public sector, where the government’s austerity programme is starting to bite.These pressures have hit the household sector, which accounts for nearly two- thirds of all UK consumption, in the pocket, according to Markit, with 43 per cent reporting having less cash available to spend in October. This, in turn, has sharply reduced householders’ appetite for big purchases: 49 per cent noted a fall in October compared with just 7 per cent who reported an increase.Savings have also suffered. The decline observed in September accelerated in October, with public sector employees seeing the fastest fall in their savings since Markit’s survey began in February 2009.Adding to the gloomy picture, household debt levels rose for the seventh consecutive month, the longest continuous rise in the survey’s history. In all, 16 per cent of respondents reported an increase in their need for unsecured credit, three times as many as the number who saw a reduction. Next year is unlikely to bring much respite, according to Mr Moore.“Around 88 per cent of households anticipate a rise in their cost of living next year, while only 31 per cent of respondents forecast increased income over this period,” he said.
726;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-19T19:20:44Z;Bail-out hopes lift sterling;;The euro wiped out early gains as divisions between France and Germany on the future of the eurozone bail-out hardened.The euro still rose against the dollar after markets entered a “risk on” phase amid reports that France and Germany had struck a deal to expand the finances of the eurozone bail-out fund.But it pared its gains later in the day as it emerged that the two countries were still far apart, with Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, said that the “coalition is divided” on this issue.A Financial Times report also said that discussions of bank recapitalisation were limited to less than €100bn of aid, a disappointment to markets as it contradicted earlier reports of a bigger package.The euro added 0.1 per cent against the dollar to $1.3755, well off its session high of $1.3869, and rose fractionally against the yen to Y105.57.But the euro slipped versus the pound, down 0.3 per cent to £0.8721 as dovish minutes from the Bank of England’s last policy meeting were offset by rising risk appetite.The pound gained 0.4 per cent to $1.5770 against the dollar and climbed 0.4 per cent to Y121.09 against the yen.The minutes from the Bank’s October policy meeting revealed a unanimous vote in favour of raising the UK’s asset purchase scheme by £75bn to £275bn.The minutes revealed that the MPC had discussed raising the purchases by £100bn.“It is the deteriorating international environment that is worrying the MPC the most,” said Chris Williamson chief economist at Markit. “A downturn in overseas demand for our exports has the eurozone, our largest trading partner, at its epicentre.“As such, there is a high chance of further stimulus being voted for before the end of the year.”The euro was aided after Greece approved a package of austerity cuts, with the socialists in full support. But analysts were, however, doubtful about the longer term resilience of the euro.Lutz Karpowitz at Commerzbank added: “When it comes to crisis management each country is only looking after its own interests. That is what has been paralysing the eurozone’s ability to act. The euro is holding up relatively well but is likely to be increasingly negatively affected.”Riskier commodity-linked currencies were broadly in decline. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 per cent to $1.0223 versus its US counterparty, and the Canadian dollar fell 0.4 per cent to C$1.0196.
727;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-12T22:51:43Z;Advertisers increase spending despite gloom;;UK advertisers are increasing their spending on marketing and promotional activity to boost sales amid weak demand, even as they become more gloomy about the economic outlook, a survey has found.The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising’s Bellwether report, conducted by Markit Economics, found that overall marketing budgets were revised up in the third quarter of 2011, with 21 per cent of companies raising spending while 17 per cent reduced it.That contrasts with a sharp drop in marketing executives’ confidence in their industries’ financial prospects, with 39 per cent saying they were less upbeat, the lowest for two and a half years.“It does indicate I think that although general levels of confidence remain low, there is a willingness to go out there and stimulate spending,” said Paul Bainsfair, director-general at the IPA, citing Tesco’s recent price-drop campaign as an example.The majority of this increased spending is going towards sales promotion, online and direct marketing, rather than traditional media such as TV or print.“Companies do have quite large cash surpluses on average and they are not making a decent return on their capital,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.“They have not been taking on staff or investing in other areas. They are operating quite efficiently. That means they have got some money. In most cases, instead of investing in brand building or expensive TV campaigns, what they are doing is looking to boost up their marketing spend to generate some quick sales and get revenues up in the short term and hopefully ride this soft patch through. It’s very uncertain conditions.”However, Mr Williamson added that pessimism was “by no means back at 2008-9 levels”.The Bellwether suggests that marketers are still failing to appreciate the return on investment provided by traditional offline media, in spite of a new study published on Thursday suggesting that returns from TV advertising have improved in the recent years.A study of 3,000 campaigns by Ebiquity commissioned by Thinkbox, the UK’s marketing body for TV advertising, found that TV creates an average return of £1.70 for every £1 invested, 22 per cent higher than five years ago.
728;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-11T21:39:39Z;Recovery has ‘stalled’, say leading economists;;"The economy continued to grow in the third quarter of this year but appears to be crawling out of recession even more slowly than in the Great Depression of the 1930s, according to a leading economics institute.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that output grew by 0.5 per cent between July and September compared with the previous three months. However, the figure partly reflects a rebound following unusual events that depressed growth in the second quarter.Simon Kirby, of Niesr, said the economy “is effectively stalled now” whereas, after the same length of time following the 1930s recession, the economy had started to accelerate back towards its pre-recession level.“The level of GDP [gross domestic product] is still 4 per cent below its pre-recession peak, suggesting that this recovery will be the weakest of any since the end of the first world war,” said Niesr in its report.The official first estimate of third-quarter GDP will be released on November 1. However, economists are already worrying about what will happen in the fourth quarter.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: “Unless the business surveys build on the modest uptick seen in September, there is a substantial risk that the economy could fall back into contraction in the fourth quarter.”Meanwhile, official statistics on industrial production – which accounts for about 15 per cent of GDP – offered mixed news on Tuesday.The figures for August showed that overall production rose 0.2 per cent from the month before, thanks in part to higher oil and gas extraction.However, manufacturing output – the biggest contributor to industrial production – fell for the third month in a row, suggesting the engine of the economic recovery had shifted into reverse.Manufacturing output fell 0.3 per cent between July and August. The Office for National Statistics also revised the previous month’s number from a slight rise to a slight fall.Production was just 1.5 per cent higher in August than the same month a year ago; at the start of the year the annual growth rate was 6.1 per cent. Manufacturers face weak growth at home and rapidly cooling growth abroad.The official figures lag behind unofficial data such as the purchasing managers’ index surveys. The latest PMI survey suggested that manufacturing activity picked up again slightly in September, although the news was not encouraging enough to dissuade the Bank of England from pumping another £75bn into the flagging economy.The Treasury said the recent economic data and estimates showed that the government’s actions were “helping the UK economy to continue to grow” even though “the recovery will be choppy”.Separately, there were signs of life in the housing market: the number of loans approved for remortgaging rose by a third in August compared with volumes a year earlier, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, while the number of loans to first time buyers rose by 5 per cent.Additional reporting by Norma Cohen"
729;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-06T15:18:50Z;CDS clearing nears real time;;Wall Street has continued the slow process of remaking fixed-income trading amid pending regulatory reforms and pressures to cut costs, with announcements this week of new products to clear credit swaps and track bond trades in real time.MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, announced on Tuesday it had completed near-real time clearing for credit-default swap trades by several large dealers.Most credit-default swap trades, along with most over-the-counter derivatives, will be required to be centrally cleared as part of the Dodd-Frank reform act. The current process takes up to five days, with batches of trades sent to the clearing house, but the Dodd-Frank rules require real-time clearing.Using MarkitSERV’s process, trades last week by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were sent within minutes to the clearing house owned by the IntercontinentalExchange, ICE Credit Clear.“The building blocks of the new Dodd-Frank world need faster connections between trading venues and clearing houses in a real-time manner, and then reporting of those trades to repositories,” said Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV. “That real-time clearing is the last building block we didn’t have in production for credit.”MarkitSERV, which connects to several clearing houses, estimates that about 20 per cent of the notional $15,000bn CDS market is cleared. Rules for mandatory clearing are still in process.Also on Tuesday, Knight Capital, among the world’s largest market-making firms, launched a new tool for analysing fixed income trades, called BondScope.The software platform allows clients of Knight, typically brokers who are trading bonds on behalf of clients, to track the execution of orders more closely and provides support in “identifying where an issue has previously traded or evaluating where similar bonds are priced”, Knight said.Bonds are typically traded manually between brokers, rather than as shares are on electronic exchanges where automated algorithms execute millions of trades every minute. Efforts by exchanges, such as NYSE Euronext, to create bond exchanges have been slow to take off in the past.“Over the last few years there has been a real push throughout the fixed-income industry to improve market transparency and execution quality,” said William Vulpis, managing director for Knight’s bond trading platform.Looming cost cuts at banks will drive further automation, according to Jay Bennett, managing director at Greenwich Associates.Revenues for trading of interest rates and credit by US commercial banks declined by 6 and 13 per cent, respectively, in the second quarter, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, versus only a 1 per cent slip for equities.“As banks increasingly look at the cost side of the equation, they are going to ask why more fixed income isn’t traded more electronically. I think it’s an area where you will start to see a lot more efficiencies,” he said.
730;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-05T18:58:04Z;China sees surge in CDS on slowdown fears;;Fears of an economic slowdown in China have fuelled a trading surge in instruments that insure investors against sovereign bond defaults, making the country a new focal point for the widely used financial products.The net value of outstanding credit default swaps on Chinese sovereign debt has soared to $8.3bn, according to data released this week by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.The market for China CDS is now the world’s 10th largest, bigger than those for Portugal and Bank of America. Two years ago there was a net $1.6bn of outstanding China CDS, making it only the world’s 227th largest at the time.“Clearly there is increasing market concern about China and a few cracks are starting to appear in its economic growth,” said Ann Wyman, head of emerging market research at Nomura. “A ‘hard landing’ still isn’t our house base case scenario, but we’re more concerned about this than we have been in the past.”Prominent hedge fund managers such as James Chanos and Hugh Hendry have frequently and publicly predicted a property crash and sharp economic slowdown in China, and have launched funds dedicated to profit from this.Mr Hendry’s fund, Eclectica Credit Fund, has notched up significant gains over the past two months, even as many industry peers have suffered losses due to the recent financial turmoil.While China’s sovereign debt is still considered as among the safest in the world, the price of China CDS hit a two-year high of 208 basis points this week, according to Markit. On Wednesday the cost of China CDS fell to 187 bps. That means it costs the equivalent of $187,000 annually to insure $10m for five years.Analysts say the increase in demand and cost for China CDS is related to recently heightened worries about ability of the authorities to orchestrate a soft landing after years of red-hot economic growth.Soaring housing prices from late 2008 to 2010 in particular have prompted fears that a property bubble could burst, with severe negative effects for the wider economy.The authorities have responded by raising mandatory mortgage downpayments, ordering banks to lend less to developers and tightening monetary policy. Wilting growth in Europe, a key export market for China, has recently exacerbated concerns.“The authorities are now faced with a difficult decision on whether to pursue monetary tightening amid global economic headwinds. September inflation data will probably dictate the next steps for policymakers,” said Alex Hamilton, an economist at Markit, the data provider.
731;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-03T18:13:10Z;Gloom prevails in manufacturing surveys;;The global manufacturing sector is in the worst shape since the summer of 2009 as slowing economic growth and the deepening eurozone crisis take their toll on the world’s factories.Purchasing managers’ index surveys released on Monday indicated global manufacturing activity weakened slightly last month to the lowest level since June 2009, when the world economy was emerging from recession. However, the fortunes of manufacturers diverged depending on their location: conditions deteriorated in Asia and the eurozone but picked up slightly in the US and UK.The JP Morgan PMI of global manufacturing fell slightly from 50.2 in August to 49.9 in September.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys, said: “Generally, the conditions in global manufacturing are getting worse, with the eurozone seeing the steepest deterioration [and] increasing signs of weakness in Asia”.The surveys come as politicians and central bankers race to resolve the eurozone sovereign debt crisis amid fears that uncertainty about the region’s fate is hampering the global economic recovery.Manufacturing activity in the US rose slightly faster than economists expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management survey, lifting hopes that the world’s biggest economy can avoid slipping back into recession. Carmakers in the US reported strong sales for September, as consumers replaced old vehicles, credit conditions eased and the supply of Japanese vehicles recovered.Activity also rose slightly in the UK, confounding economists’ expectations that the sector would shrink. In both the US and the UK, rising production coincided with a drop in backlogs of work, which economists said suggested the pace of expansion might not be sustainable.In the eurozone, the manufacturing sector shrank for the second month in a row, with new orders falling at their fastest pace since June 2009. Economists at Barclays Capital said this was “consistent with a deepening industrial recession”. German manufacturers were the strongest in the region while those in Greece, Spain and Ireland suffered most.PMI surveys in Asia showed a fourth successive monthly fall in activity in Taiwan, while manufacturing in India slowed to its weakest level for two and a half years. Conditions also worsened in Japan. Official PMI figures for China, published at the weekend by the National Bureau of Statistics, showed a slight improvement in activity.Manufacturers continued to hire more people in the US, Germany, Japan and several other countries, while there were job losses in China, the UK and India, among others.
732;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-03T10:14:33Z;UK manufacturing activity picks up;;Activity in the UK manufacturing sector picked up slightly last month after a sluggish summer, according to a closely-watched survey that confounded economists’ expectations of more bad news.The Markit purchasing managers’ index rose from a revised 49.4 in August to 51.1 in September. Economists had expected the index to fall slightly.“The modest return to growth of UK manufacturing output in September is a positive but it is hard to escape the fact that the sector’s performance has weakened substantially since the growth surge [at the start of the year],” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will meet later this week to decide whether to use another round of quantitative easing – creating electronic money to buy assets – to stimulate the economy.Economists were cautious about how much the PMI data might influence the MPC’s decision, since manufacturing activity remains much weaker than earlier in the year and only accounts for about 13 per cent of the UK’s gross domestic product.Other PMI surveys across Europe and Asia indicated a broad slowdown of manufacturing activity on Monday.The UK is not immune to the cooling of global demand: UK manufacturers’ new export orders contracted at the quickest pace since May 2009, with weaker demand in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.However, there was a rise in domestic orders and a surge in manufacturing production. The production sub-index rose from 49.2 in August to 53.3 in September, although much of the increase was caused by manufacturers tearing through their work backlogs, which fell at their fastest pace in two years.“Many manufacturers are living off the backlog of orders they have yet to complete, as well as promotional activity and new product launches,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.“The overall picture is rather downbeat as growth for the third quarter is well below the average,” he added.Employment in the manufacturing sector fell for the third month in a row: companies in the timber and paper and transport sectors reported the biggest job losses. These were also the sectors where production was weakest.Meanwhile, inflationary pressures on manufacturers eased. Input costs were still rising in September but at the slowest pace since January last year.
733;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
734;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-03T09:12:15Z;Asian PMI data continue to soften;;"Manufacturing industry sentiment continued to soften in Asia in September, with purchasing managers’ index data from several countries showing activity flat or falling during the month.The latest PMI numbers, released on Monday by HSBC and Markit, showed the fourth successive monthly fall in activity in Taiwan, while activity in India remained positive, but was at its weakest level for two and a half years.Leif Eskesen, HSBC’s chief economist for India, said growth momentum was easing on weaker orders as industry struggled with a combination of softening global economic activity and continuing domestic inflation pressures.The PMI survey showed that input prices rose substantially during September, reflecting higher raw material costs, while the rate of growth in new orders slowed for the sixth successive month. Employment in the sector decreased for the second sucessive month.In Taiwan, where business conditions have been weakening since early 2010, new order volumes contracted sharply, with both domestic and overseas demand weakening during the month, although new export business declined slightly less quickly than in August.Official PMI figures for China, published at the weekend by the National Bureau of Statistics, showed a slight improvement in activity, while a parallel survey by HSBC and Markit showed the sector continuing to contract slightly.Other data released recently by Markit and the Japan Materials Management Association showed Japan’s manufacturing activity contracting for the first time since April.The detailed PMI data for September are: Taiwan 44.5 from 45.2 in August; India 50.4 from 52.6; Japan 49.3 from 51.9; China official 51.2 from 50.9; China unofficial steady at 49.9.PMI index numbers higher than 50 indicate an expansion in activity, while numbers less than that level indicate a contraction. South Korea’s PMI will be published on Tuesday."
735;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-10-02T16:26:50Z;ECB faces interest rate dilemma;Bank faces calls to lower rates despite inflation worry;Purchasing manager surveys on business activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will have added significance this week for any bearing they may have on policy decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday.Final eurozone PMIs for September are expected to confirm flash estimates that activity in manufacturing and services contracted.The manufacturing index is out on Monday and the flash estimate showed a reading of 48.4, down from 49 in August. Any level below 50 indicates contraction.Meanwhile, the services index on Wednesday should confirm that non-manufacturing activity contracted to 49.1 from 51.5 in August.“Calls for the ECB to either reverse the two interest rate hikes earlier in the year, or embark on quantitative easing, have grown louder in response to a broad-based eurozone slowdown,” says Alex Hamilton, economist at Markit.September inflation figures, however, showed hawks on the governing council still have cause for concern as consumer prices surged to 3 per cent from 2.5 per cent. “On balance, it looks like the ECB will choose to do nothing,” adds Mr Hamilton.The central bank, whose policy rate currently stands at 1.5 per cent, announces its decision on Thursday.The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee also meets on Thursday and little is expected, but the minutes from September showed most of the nine members said they thought further quantitative easing would be warranted at some point.UK purchasing managers have reported weakening manufacturing activity, and Monday’s release is expected to show a further contraction to 48.4 from 49 in August. Services, however, have just about held their ground in expansion territory and a reading of 50.7 is expected on Wednesday, down from 51.1 in August.“The Bank has strongly signalled its intention to embark on another round of QE, but in our view the MPC will wait until November,” says Amit Kara at UBS.Purchasing managers in the US also deliver September surveys this week, and are seen holding in expansion territory. But the biggest release of the week Stateside will be the September non-farm payrolls report.The consensus view is 56,000 new jobs created in September but recent results have made a mockery of predictions and it may be worth looking more at the unemployment rate.Economists at HSBC point out that the recent pace of job creation has not been strong enough to offset population growth and the jobless rate is likely to keep rising. HSBC believes the rate will pick up to 9.2 per cent in September from 9.1 per cent in August.Other data releases this week include the Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturing, the final reading of UK second-quarter GDP, German industrial orders and production.There are also central bank policy decisions from the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday and the Bank of Japan on Friday, neither of which are expected to alter current policy settings.
736;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-30T20:16:20Z;Rolet goes through a change of fortune;;This week marked a turnround in the fortunes of Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, and a new chapter in London's position as a global financial centre.Three months after the failure of his attempt to merge the LSE with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, Mr Rolet had good news from the board of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house.It approved the LSE making a €20-a-share offer for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet to the clearer’s 98 shareholders – mostly banks that are users of the institution. Mr Rolet beat a rival bid from Markit, a derivatives post-trade company run by Canadian Lance Uggla.Now Mr Rolet, 51, finds himself with much more to handle than just trying to clinch the deal. He and the LSE have become embroiled in a bigger chess game involving the consolidation of all three of London’s main market infrastructures: the LSE, LCH.Clearnet and the London Metal Exchange.This week the LME, the largest metals market in the world, said it had received more than 10 expressions of interest from many of the biggest exchanges, thought to include CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, two US futures exchanges, and SGX, the Singapore bourse.Icap, the interdealer broker run by leading City figure Michael Spencer, has said it is interested. Others expected to run the slide rule over the 164-year-old exchange – where traders still shout orders from red leather benches in a “ring” – are TMX Group and ASX, the Australian exchange.The LME has been “top of everyone’s M&A list for about five years”, says one industry insider.The whirlwind of developments around the Square Mile is a sign that the epicentre of exchange mergers, which had sputtered recently amid nationalist and antitrust hurdles, has been restarted around London.That hands Mr Rolet a starring role in the process, along with his counterpart at the LME, Martin Abbott – a former publisher of Metal Bulletin magazine – and Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet.At stake is a redefinition of London’s market structures at a time when trading flows are shifting to Asia and a raft of new EU regulations is emerging. The new rules will require London to build up its exchange and clearing business. A merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext looms, too. That would create the world’s largest exchange group with four times the revenues of the LSE. In recent years London has lost the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) to US ownership – it was bought by ICE – and Liffe, the futures exchange, to NYSE Euronext, robbing the LSE of the chance to own a London-based futures exchange.Lynton Jones, chairman of Bourse Consult and the last chief executive of the IPE, says the City’s loss of control over the two UK exchanges was “a failure to see that these market structures are global”. He adds: “I think Xavier sees that, but the problem is it’s a little bit late so he has a fight on his hands.”The urgency to think global may explain why the LSE has enlisted the help of SGX, the Singapore exchange, as a minority partner in its bid for LCH.Clearnet, says one person familiar with the matter. There are also reports that Mr Rolet has discussed teaming up with SGX counterpart Magnus Böcker on a bid for the LME. The LSE declined to comment. Mr Rolet, recently recovered from pneumonia, will need all the energy he can muster to play the chess to his advantage.
737;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-29T13:13:39Z;Deutsche deal ends bank debt drought;;Deutsche Bank has reopened the market for senior unsecured bank debt, ending a record drought of issuance amid eurozone turmoil and potentially paving the way for other financials to source valuable funding.The German bank has sold €1.5bn ($2bn) worth of two-year floating-rate notes at a yield of 98 basis points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate. That is more than the approximately 40 bps premium Deutsche paid to issue two-year securities in February, highlighting the current strained environment for Europe’s banks.Still, the new issue will be welcomed by the market after almost three months without a benchmark deal in senior unsecured debt, which is not backed by its own specific collateral.Banks need to be able to issue new funding in order to keep lending, but have been deterred from issuing amid market volatility and investor uncertainty.“Deutsche Bank is probably one of the few institutions that can still get a deal done – although they paid up for the privilege,” said Suki Mann, credit strategist at Société Générale. “But this looks like a tentative reopening, gauging interest and testing the breadth and depth of the market.”Debt syndicate desks describe a number of banks waiting for a “window” of market stability in which to issue, although elevated spreads on European credit mean only the strongest banks will probably want to sell their debt.Markets have rallied this week on hopes that European leaders will be able to come up with a solution to the region’s widening debt crisis. Germany on Thursday approved a boost to Europe’s bail-out fund, the European financial stability facility, sending the euro up as much as 1 per cent.The Markit iTraxx financials index linked to the senior debt of 25 European banks has dropped about 24 percentage points this week, indicating investors were becoming more comfortable with the debt.“You never know how long these windows are open, and you are generally well advised to take advantage of them,” said Deutsche Bank’s global head of debt issuance, Jonathan Blake. “I think it is likely that markets will remain volatile over the coming months.” “Deutsche Bank had guided for a 100 basis point pick-up over Euribor, but was able to slightly reduce that premium. Investors came mostly from Germany and Europe, Mr Blake added. The German bank was 90 per cent funded for this year before the deal.Before the Deutsche sale, the last benchmark issuance by a non-state-owned European bank took place in July, when Italy’s UniCredit sold floating-rate paper.Regulators had expressed worries over a lack of new senior unsecured debt, traditionally the bread and butter of banks’ funding tools. While banks have access to day-to-day short-term liquidity through numerous central bank facilities, finding replacements for longer-term debt funding has been more challenging.
738;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-27T19:39:01Z;Every bourse wants a house of its own;;For years, the London Stock Exchange has operated with one hand tied behind its back.It has lacked its own clearing house to handling the processing of share trades. That job has been done by LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house formed from the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA, clearer for the former Paris Bourse.But that looks set to change after the board of LCH.Clearnet, led by Ian Axe, chief executive, on Monday approved a €21 a share bid by the LSE for 51 per cent of the clearer, beating a rival offer of €12 a share from Markit, a fast-growing derivatives post-trade company.The offer must now be submitted to LCH.Clearnet’s 98 shareholders, 87 per cent of which are market participants such as banks, with NYSE Euronext – operator of the New York Stock Exchange – holding 9 per cent and the London Metal Exchange with the rest.Few doubt the strategic rationale for LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet’s move.Exchanges all around him have been busy locking in clearing houses into their businesses, building “vertical silos”, in industry jargon.Such a structure not only allows an exchange to lock in valuable clearing fees on top of trading fees. It also gives an exchange far greater control over its destiny since controlling clearing helps get new products to market faster and allows an exchange to offer savings to traders through efficient pooling of margin collateral.Moreover, the LSE faces being overshadowed in Europe by the prospect of a combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, currently undergoing antitrust scrutiny in Brussels.The amount that the LSE is proposing to pay for LCH.Clearnet – almost double what Markit offered – shows that Mr Rolet needs a knockout blow to secure what is one of the world’s most prized post-trade assets, industry experts say.To appease the concern of banks that the LSE might raise clearing fees at LCH.Clearnet once integrated, Mr Rolet is likely to have structured the deal in a way that gives the banks some power in the overall structure.Mr Rolet – himself a former Lehman and Goldman Sachs banker used to dealing with exchanges and clearers – has proved that this model can work at Turquoise, the former 100 per cent bank-owned equities trading platforms that the LSE now controls, with the banks retaining 49 per cent.His last big move, an attempted merger with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s main exchanges, failed in June when it won insufficient support from TMX shareholders.“Strategically it makes sense but the guy has taken leave of his senses. I have not spoken to a single shareholder who hasn’t said ‘we can’t believe our luck’,” one says.Not only is LCH.Clearnet hard to value, being a not-entirely integrated product of its 2003 merger, but its financial results have hardly inspired. Profit before tax in the 2010 financial year was €32.3m, compared with €163.5m, after net revenue fell 21 per cent to €355.6m.Yet the LSE can probably afford it. The LSE’s net debt (of £370m) to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio in March was one times. Daniel Garrod, a Barclays Capital analyst, says LSE management has indicated that it could leverage up towards two times earnings, suggesting firepower of £650m-£700m.LSE shares closed at 842½p, up 1.8 per cent.There are also benefits for London. Securing LCH.Clearnet would give the LSE its own clearing house in the UK at a time when London’s flagship market infrastructures – LCH.Clearnet, the LSE and the London Metal Exchange – are in a state of flux.They face the twin threats of the Börse/NYSE merger and a wave of regulation from Brussels that is set to reshape market structures in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.London also could be undermined by eurozone policies that favour moving more activities such as clearing to the Continent. The UK government is set to sue the European Central Bank for a policy that would require clearers outside the eurozone that conduct a certain amount of euro-denominated business to relocate to the eurozone.Bringing together the LSE and LCH.Clearnet is “a tangible endorsement of the value of London-based infrastructure,” says Barney Reynolds at the law firm Shearman & Sterling.
739;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-27T15:36:26Z;Rolet aims to land knock-out blow;;It was like waiting for the white smoke in a papal election. But the board of LCH.Clearnet has decided to approve the London Stock Exchange’s offer for the clearer over a lower proposal from Markit, the post-trade and data company.The LSE’s offer of up to €21 a share for a 51 per cent stake values the clearer at about €1bn (£870m), and is significantly higher than Markit’s offer of €12 a share, plus an earn-out, for the whole company. It now goes to LCH.Clearnet’s 98 shareholders for approval – but this is not a done deal.At least two questions arise.First, why is Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, proposing to pay so much?The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was offering €739m when it went after LCH.Clearnet in 2008, while the “Lily” consortium of banks, including Icap, the inter-dealer broker, offered €11 a share a year later, valuing the clearer at about €830m at the time.Not only is LCH.Clearnet hard to value, being a not-entirely-integrated product of the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA, but its financial results have hardly inspired in the past two years. Profit before tax in the 2010 financial year was €32.3m, compared with €163.5m, after net revenue fell 21 per cent to €355.6m.Tariff reductions took their toll in cash equities clearing as the clearer engaged in a price war on clearing fees against smaller rivals like EMCF and Euro CCP. Pressure on fees remains, as “interoperability” – the ability to choose equities clearer – came into play this summer.LCH.Clearnet also has been losing customers – notably ICE and Liffe, the futures exchanges – although it has tried to make up the shortfall by winning some new business, notably in Asia. And its RepoClear repo clearing business does make decent money.Second, how would Mr Rolet handle SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s interest rates swaps clearing service and the banks heavily involved in it? The largest of those banks are leading shareholders in LCH.Clearnet and members of the OTCDerivNet corporate governance committee that “runs” SwapClear.Moreover, the LSE has no track record in SwapClear’s business of clearing over-the-counter interest rate swaps.In answer to the first question, Mr Rolet needs to deliver a knock-out blow to secure LCH.Clearnet. And judging by the fact that – as I undertstand it – only 3 of the 15 banks on the LCH.Clearnet board voted for Markit, the banks were looking a gift horse in the mouth.Fortunately, Mr Rolet can afford it. The LSE’s net debt (of £370m) to ebitda ratio in March was one times. Daniel Garrod, a Barclays Capital analyst, says LSE management has indicated it could leverage up towards two times earnings, suggesting firepower of £650m-£700m.There are also possible synergies – building on an ongoing restructuring under Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet chief executive. Progress has been made in integrating the clearer’s IT systems, which are spread between Paris and London, but more could be done. Overheads could be shrunk, for example.On the revenue side, the LSE could bring new products (especially derivatives) to the table. Having its own clearer would help get those products to market fast – just as CME Group and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse futures unit, have shown in the past.Arguably the bigger opportunity is on the treasury management side. Clearing houses make most of their money from lending out the margin collateral that members and customers deposit with them (last year, the value of collateral held on behalf of clearing members at LCH.Clearnet was up 15 per cent up at €510bn). The LSE has done well recently improving the treasury side of its only existing clearing business, Borsa Italiana’s Cassa clearing house.As for the banks, they will naturally be concerned to ensure that clearing fees are not ramped up. But Mr Rolet used to sit on their side of the table when he was at Lehman Brothers, and knows that he cannot do any deal without assuaging such concerns.The solution might be to create a governance structure where the banks have enough skin in the game to act as a check on pricing and other powers. Mr Rolet has already had success with this model at Turquoise, the former 100 per cent bank-owned equities trading platforms that the LSE now controls (the banks retain 49 per cent). Turquoise has done well, proving that the “re-mutualisation” of the relationship between exchanges and banks can work.But there is one complication: the London Metal Exchange, which along with NYSE Euronext has 17 per cent of the shares in LCH.Clearnet.Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive who is a board member of LCH.Clearnet, has spiced things up in London. First, he has said that the LME is looking at building its own clearing house, a move that would see it cutting ties with LCH.Clearnet, which clears its metals contracts. Second, he revealed that the LME is itself in play.Were LME to sell itself to another exchange – ICE, say – then that would immediately affect LCH.Clearnet’s valuation. But, if the LSE is really serious about building an integrated exchange and clearing house, even that may not be problematic. It just depends on how determined Mr Rolet is to get hold of a clearer. The answer seems to be: very.
740;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-27T14:08:11Z;Retail sales sluggish as family budgets fall;;The average family has £14 less to spend each week than it did a year ago, according to supermarket chain Asda, as slow wage growth and high inflation leave people worse off than they were during the recession.Asda’s monthly “income tracker” data showed that the average family’s weekly disposable income (after taxes and essentials) fell by 7.9 per cent in August – the biggest decline since the supermarket’s records began in January 2007.Since consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of the UK’s gross domestic product, the figures underline the problems facing the economy as well as the country’s retailers. Separate data from the CBI business lobby on Tuesday showed that sales on the high street were broadly similar in September as in August but remain much weaker than a year ago.While 24 per cent of the retailers surveyed said sales were better than a year ago, 39 per cent said they were worse. This was the worst balance since May 2010. The three month moving average, a smoother measure of the sales trend, was the weakest since the summer of 2009.“High street sales are sluggish but appear to be stabilising,” said Judith McKenna, who chairs the CBI survey panel and is Asda’s chief operating officer. “With the consumer squeeze set to get tighter with the winter utility bills rise, we expect retailers will face a challenging October.”Retailers that sell expensive items had the toughest time, as many consumers try to deal with pay packets that barely cover bills and essentials.Sales of durable household goods, furniture and carpets and clothing were much lower than a year ago, the survey suggested. Meanwhile, grocers reported sales broadly in line with the same month last year.There are signs that retailers are beginning to sacrifice profit margins in pursuit of higher sales, which could ease the inflationary pressures crimping consumer spending. This week, Tesco announced a swathe of price cuts, which analysts think could spark a price war.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said the CBI survey “adds to a growing body of evidence which suggests that retailers will enter the all-important final quarter of the year fighting for business in the face of weak consumer confidence”.He added that intense competition on the high street would “act as a drag on economic growth” even if it eased consumer price inflation.Wholesalers were more sanguine than retailers in September. Of those surveyed, 36 per cent reported a rise in the volume of sales, while 23 per cent reported a decline.However, retailers reduced orders to their suppliers and an increasing number said their stocks were adequate to meet the current level of demand.
741;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-26T18:53:08Z;Post-trade expert to advise on LCH bid;;The London Stock Exchange has hired Serge Harry, a post-trade expert and former deputy head of strategy at NYSE Euronext, as an adviser as the UK bourse pursues a bid for LCH. Clearnet.The London-based clearer's board met on Monday to consider bids for the group from the LSE and Markit, the post-trade and over-the-counter derivatives data company. Two people familiar with the matter said the board meeting ended on Monday afternoon. Asked whether any decision had been made, one said: “They are still working things out.”Neither LCH.Clearnet, the LSE nor Markit were available for comment.Mr Harry, who was most recently chief executive of Bluenext, the emissions exchange owned by NYSE Euronext and Caisse de Depots, said he had been hired to advise LSE chief executive on its pursuit of LCH. Clearnet. “My area of expertise is front and back office,” he said when reached by FT Trading Room.He said he was advising LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet on LCH.Clearnet.The hiring of an expert in post-trade, especially in the Paris markets, will be useful to the LSE if it manages to clinch the LCH.Clearnet deal, since the group has a large cash equities clearing business at Clearnet SA in Paris.France is keen to ensure that post-trade infrastructures such as clearing remain and are strengthened in Paris as part of exchange and clearing consolidation – focused on the propose combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext – and as Brussels reshapes the clearing landscape in Europe through new regulations and directives.He would also be useful – should the LSE succeed in its bid – on an expansion of derivatives and other products at LCH.Clearnet that the LSE may instigate. Mr Harry was also a key figure in the post-trade aspects of the integration of Liffe, the futures exchange, into Euronext.Mr Harry has held a series of roles in post-trade, mostly in France, playing an important role in dealing with Clearnet, the Paris-based clearer for the former Paris Bourse immediately after the creation of Euronext.Mr Harry was also chief financial officer of Euronext Paris for seven years before Euronext was acquired by New York Stock Exchange group, before becoming deputy head of strategy NYSE Euronext, a job he left last year.He was deputy chief executive of the Paris Bourse from 1999-2000 and spent 16 years at Sicovam, which later became Euroclear France.
742;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-25T23:19:34Z;LCH poised to choose between rival bids;SGX interested in  joining one offer;The battle for control of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house, is expected to move closer to resolution today as the clearer’s board meets to decide between rival bids from the London Stock Exchange and Markit, a financial data and derivatives post-trade company.The development comes as the UK clearer has attracted interest from other parties interested in teaming up with the existing two bidders.SGX, the Singapore exchange, was interested in joining one of the bids, two people familiar with the matter said. NYSE Euronext had teamed up with Markit initially but withdrew recently and has been replaced by Nasdaq OMX, which in June expressed interest in a minority stake. SGX was not immediately available for comment.The bids come as London’s key market infrastructures have been thrown into flux as Brussels regulators finalise sweeping reform of derivatives and equities markets. It also comes as exchanges have been swept up in a wave of consolidation.Both developments have turned clearing houses into prized assets, with LCH.Clearnet – the largest clearer left that is not owned by an exchange – as a key target. It has 98 shareholders, mostly market participants such as banks but also exchanges including NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a transaction is completed if one side defaults. A push by G20 regulators to force more OTC, or off-exchange, derivatives through clearing is set to benefit clearers such as LCH.Clearnet.The LSE has tabled a €21 a share bid for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn (£873m). Markit has offered €15 a share for the whole company.The UK bourse wants LCH.Clearnet to acquire its own UK-based clearing business, which it lacks at a time when exchange ownership of clearing houses has been a growing trend.The trend has been reinforced by the prospect of a combined Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which would dwarf the LSE.However, banks were nervous about the power of such combinations to raise clearing fees and the LSE’s bid included a cap on fees at LCH.Clearnet for a period, a third person said.For Markit, the attraction of LCH.Clearnet lies in its Swapclear interest rate swaps clearing service, which it runs in conjunction with the largest banks dealing in OTC derivatives. Such banks were also shareholders in Markit, making the businesses a good fit, according to analysts.LCH.Clearnet is also clearer for the London Metal Exchange, which on Friday said it had received expressions of interest from unnamed bidders.A fourth person said that bidders included CME Group, SGX and ICE.
743;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-19T23:05:54Z;Global industry forecasts UK growth spurt;;The UK’s stuttering manufacturing sector has received a boost from a survey indicating that global industrial companies expect the country to become one of the world’s growth hotspots.A day after Jaguar Land Rover confirmed plans to invest £355m in building an engine plant in the Midlands, a poll from the Economist Intelligence Unit points to the unlikely emergence of Britain as one of the world’s most eagerly anticipated manufacturing powerhouses.Only China, India and the US came ahead of the UK when researchers asked manufacturing companies to name the countries from which they expected to increase product sourcing over the next two years.Economists expressed surprise at the findings, published today – given that various official data in recent months have pointed to a sharp slowdown in activity.Michele Hendricks, manufacturing executive at the professional services firm KPMG, said the UK’s strong showing was something of a “brain-scratcher.”The UK is one of several developed markets that emerged as a favoured destination. The report argues that volatile commodity prices and higher transport costs mean that western-based companies are more likely to source products nearer home.“Ever-increasing natural disasters are also causing companies to think twice about relying so heavily on a single source or single region for key components,” it adds.More than half of the UK executives surveyed expected to buy more products from their domestic market. The authors said British manufacturing companies had also benefited from a weak pound and eurozone instability.Meanwhile, the UK ranked sixth when the businesses were asked from which territories they expected to garner the biggest sales improvement over the period.The annual survey of 220 of the world’s biggest manufacturing companies with at least US$1bn in revenue was conducted over June and July on behalf of KPMG.
744;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-15T11:42:14Z;High street sales fall in August;;Spending on Britain’s high streets was stagnant in August as rising prices in the shops put a strain on people’s budgets.The volume of retail sales excluding fuel fell 0.1 per cent in August from the month before and 0.1 per cent from the same month a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. The value of retail sales excluding fuel was the same level as the month before and 3.2 per cent higher than the same month a year ago.“The combined effect of rising prices and weak labour market conditions have provided a challenging backdrop for retail sales activity over much of the year. In the absence of a sharp improvement in both, this is likely to continue over the coming months,” David Page at Lloyds Bank said.The so-called implied deflator, a measure of annual retail price inflation, rose to 4.7 per cent in August – the highest since 2008.Separately, a Bank of England survey released on Thursday showed that consumer inflation expectations have ticked higher: respondents thought inflation would be 4.2 per cent over the next year compared with 3.9 per cent when they were asked in May. They expected inflation to be 3.5 per cent in the longer term, up from 3.3 per cent in May.Economists said this data would make for uncomfortable reading at the Bank, which has indicated it will keep interest rates very low for some time to support the weak economy. However, there is little indication these expectations are feeding into wage pressures.“With unemployment and job insecurity high, households might feel prices rising but they aren’t asking their employers for more pay. While this situation remains, it’s hard to see inflation becoming entrenched,” economists at HSBC said in a note to clients.Annual inflation is running at 4.5 per cent and is expected to breach 5 per cent before the end of the year. However, the Bank thinks it will fall sharply next year.Within the retail sales figures, the value of food sales rose 5 per cent on a year ago but the volume of sales fell 0.8 per cent. The volume of non-food sales fell 1.2 per cent with household goods stores particularly badly hit.Internet sales continued to rise, though, and were up 13.7 per cent from a year ago.The ONS said it was difficult to quantify the effects of the riots that swept through several UK cities in August. Some stores suffered but others benefited as a result.
745;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-13T17:53:05Z;Inflation rises to 4.5% in August;;The annual inflation rate rose slightly in August to 4.5 per cent as rising utility bills compounded higher clothing, footwear and furniture prices.Economists, who expected the slight rise in the consumer price index, think the worst is yet to come as more utility companies plan to increase their prices sharply in the next few months. The Bank of England expects CPI to reach about 5 per cent later this year before falling rapidly in 2012.“The data will do little to change views at the Bank of England, where policy appears to be based more on providing a support to the worrying fragility of the economic recovery than current price developments,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.The retail price index was 5.2 per cent in August, up from 5 per cent in July.Some economists were worried that clothing and furniture prices rose sharply in spite of weak consumer demand. Clothing and footwear prices rose 3.7 per cent between July and August as summer sales came to an end, compared with a rise of 2.8 per cent between the same two months a year ago. Furniture prices rose 2 per cent between July and August compared with a 1 per cent rise a year ago.“The concern is that inflation pressures, rather than diminishing in the face of the ongoing squeeze in disposable income, are in a number of key categories increasing as retailers seek to protect or re-build margins,” said Ross Walker at the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, he added that monthly changes such as these can be volatile.Prices of recreation and cultural goods, such as games, toys and consoles, fell 0.4 per cent between July and August after rising 0.2 per cent between the same two months last year.Over the 12 month period, fuel prices were 17 per cent higher, air fares were 7.7 per cent higher and food and drink prices were 6.2 per cent higher. Next year, effects such as January’s increase in value added tax and the spring surge in commodity prices will drop out of the annual comparison, which should reduce the headline annual inflation rate.Separately, the UK trade deficit remained at £4.5bn in July as higher exports were counterbalanced by higher imports, frustrating policymakers’ hopes to “rebalance” the economy.The goods trade deficit widened slightly from £8.87bn to £8.92bn. Export prices of goods fell slightly while import prices rose 1.3 per cent.
746;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-07T14:11:52Z;Weak data raise fears for manufacturing;;Manufacturing production rose slightly in July but only to levels seen at the start of the year, suggesting the sector’s recovery has stalled but not reversed.The official data came as the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that output in the economy as a whole grew by just 0.2 per cent in the three months to the end of August, after growth of 0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of July.“If this economic weakness persists over the next few months, the [Bank of England’s] monetary policy committee will probably implement a further round of quantitative easing,” the Niesr said. The MPC is set to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday amid fears that a tumultuous summer has stripped the economy of the little momentum it had.However, the manufacturing figures from Office of National Statistics did not confirm economists’ worst fears of a fall in production amid weak domestic and global demand. Manufacturing output rose 0.1 per cent from the previous month and 1.9 per cent from the same month a year ago.Recent surveys have offered mixed messages on the health of manufacturing. Those from the CBI business lobby and the EEF manufacturing group suggest the sector is still in reasonable shape, but the latest purchasing managers’ survey, which many economists think is more reliable, suggested production started to decline in August.“We are still little fearful of what might come, and more so than normal because of the enormous weight that rests on manufacturing at the moment,” said David Page, economist at Lloyds Bank. With consumer spending depressed by declining real wages, economists and policymakers have looked to the manufacturing sector to drive the economic recovery.The ONS’s broader measure of industrial production, which also includes mining and quarrying and utilities, fell 0.2 per cent from the month before.The decline was driven by a 1.5 per cent drop in oil and gas extraction, which has now shrunk by a third since 2006. Maintenance work on North Sea oil rigs has taken longer than expected, the ONS said, compounding the longer term decline in oil production.In manufacturing, which accounts for the bulk of industrial production, seven sectors recorded a better month in July and six recorded a worse month. The biggest contributors to the slight rise in overall production were the electrical and optical industries and the coke, petrol and nuclear industries. Output from the textile and leather clothing industries fell by 3.5 per cent.“What strength there is here is clearly not strong enough to drive solid GDP growth across the board,” said Neville Hill at Credit Suisse. “That said, we think these production numbers haven’t been weak enough for long enough to have a significant impact on the MPC’s decision this month.”
747;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-06T19:33:50Z;LCH.Clearnet at centre of bid battle;;In 1888, the Financial Times reported in one of its first editions the creation of the London Produce Clearing House, warning that it would turn the city’s produce markets into “one vast gambling house”.Well over a century later London’s main clearing house LCH.Clearnet - which traces its roots back to the LPCH through the former London Clearing House - is firmly established as one of the most critical pieces of market infrastructure in Europe.But the clearer is now at the centre of a bidding war between Markit, a provider of post-trade services in the derivatives markets, and the London Stock Exchange.The rival interest in LCH.Clearnet shows how clearing houses have been propelled into the mainstream of financial services post-2008 crisis regulatory reforms.Clearing is seen by regulators as one way to help prevent the fallout from another big market dislocation such as the Lehman Brothers default. They have enshrined greater use of clearing of over-the-counter derivatives in measures such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US.A clearing house acts as guarantor of trades between two parties, using funds deposited with it by market participants to ensure that deals are completed if one side defaults.LCH.Clearnet operates a clearing service for OTC interest rate swaps called SwapClear, widely seen as the most attractive part of its business since it is well-positioned to take advantage of Dodd-Frank and similar European proposals.Clearing houses also have become prized assets since they fit well with the business of an exchange, providing the essential post-trade process of clearing that is common to most exchange-traded equities and derivatives.Exchanges have been building clearing into their businesses, since that allows them to generate clearing revenues on top of charging trading fees.This helps explain why the LSE has entered into talks with LCH.Clearnet about acquiring a majority stake. People close to the deal say the LSE is prepared to offer €21 a share for the clearer, valuing it at about €1bn ($1.4bn).The LSE lacks a clearer of its own for its main London share market, using LCH.Clearnet instead – making it a laggard in the sector.The prospect of a merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext means the LSE risks being overshadowed by the creation of a near-monopoly in derivatives trading and clearing. The merger would bring together the German operator’s Eurex platform with the US exchange’s Liffe futures platform.While market participants are broadly supportive of the German-US tie-up, they want to ensure that the resulting clearing arrangements are opened up to competition.Not only are antitrust authorities in Brussels examining this issue as part of their probe of the proposed merger but, separately, the European Commission is pushing the idea of greater competition in derivatives clearing in an overhaul of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which laid the groundwork for competition in share trading in 2007.The LSE believes it has a chance to offer a new structure where the exchange would control LCH.Clearnet but would, crucially, operate it in conjunction with key market participants and operate it as an “open” structure that would allow competition.The LSE already operates a trading platform called Turquoise in this way.Yet the Markit offer – priced at €15 a share for the whole of LCH.Clearnet – is also compelling, industry experts say.Markit operates globally in data, valuation and trade processing in the OTC derivatives markets.Industry experts suggest this makes it a good fit with SwapClear, which is run by a governance structure known as OTCDerivNet dominated by the big OTC derivatives dealer banks. Indeed many of Markit’s shareholders are the same banks in OTCDerivNet.Meanwhile, LCH.Clearnet is undergoing a radical restructuring under its new chief executive, former Barclays Capital banker Ian Axe. He wants to turn the not-for-profit clearer - 83 per cent owned by market participants and 17 per cent by NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange - into a commercially driven enterprise.Roger Barton, managing director of Financial Reform Consultancy, says: “The aspect of the Markit [offer] that makes most sense is that Markit is more representative of the largest dealers and I’m sure they have a particular interest in SwapClear. The dynamic for the LSE in equities and equity derivatives products is somewhat different, and I’m not quite sure how that plays out.”
748;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-05T23:02:36Z;Service sector growth falls sharply;;Conditions in the UK service sector appeared to deteriorate sharply in August, suggesting that the economy’s problems have grown broader and more acute.The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index fell from 55.4 in July to 51.1 in August, the biggest monthly drop in activity for a decade.The service sector, which includes transport, financial services and hotels and restaurants, accounts for the majority of gross domestic product in the UK.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Capital, said the numbers “should not have come as a surprise, given the financial market jitters and bloodbath in international indicators”.Surveys last week pointed to worsening conditions in the UK’s manufacturing and construction sectors, too, as demand faltered at home and abroad.Nevertheless, the service sector is still growing. Any score above 50 indicates expansion rather than contraction.Respondents to the survey said backlogs of work in the sector had shrunk, while 14 per cent said they had reduced staff levels. Job losses were mostly concentrated in sectors that dealt directly with consumers, such as hotels, transport, catering, restaurants and communications.The new business index fell from 55.6 in July to 53.4 in August – a gentler decline than that of activity as a whole.Economists said the survey results increased the likelihood that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee would launch another round of quantitative easing – the creation of money to buy assets – perhaps even as soon as its next meeting on Thursday.“Overall, these figures serve further to highlight the fragility of the recovery and make it likely the MPC will give serious consideration to the case for more QE when it meets later this week,” said Blerina Uruci at Barclays Capital.Companies reported that input prices were still rising, but at the slowest rate for eight months. However, they barely increased their own prices, suggesting demand was too weak for them to pass on rising costs to customers.Separately, a survey from the British Retail Consortium showed that high street sales remained weak in August but did not collapse in spite of the riots that hit several cities.Total value sales were 1.5 per cent higher in August than the same month last year, though the figures do not strip out the effect of inflation. Food sales held up better than non-food sales as people spent on essentials and cut back on luxuries.
749;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-05T13:19:47Z;Quick View: why the LSE is going after LCH.Clearnet;SwapClear is a major hurdle that must be addressed;"For the past year or so, the one thing you didn’t do at the London Stock Exchange was mention the c-word.I mean, of course, clearing. For most of this time the LSE’s clearing strategy has been, at best, opaque.Shortly after he was hired in January 2010, the exchange’s head of post-trade, Kevin Milne, spent a lot of time talking with the LSE’s biggest customers – the banks – about the LSE’s clearing arrangements.With exchanges verticalising around it, the idea was to figure out what this meant for the LSE, which lacks an in-house clearer for its main UK market (even as it has a clearer in Italy for the Milan market).Plus there was a crescendo building around the broader issue of clearing thanks to the upcoming European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir).Then things started to get interesting. Xavier Rolet, chief executive, signalled in May last year that relations between the LSE and LCH.Clearnet, its third party clearing provider, had all but broken down.He sent a shot across LCH.Clearnet’s bow by suggesting for the first time that the LSE might be looking for an alternative provider of clearing services.Lack of “in-house capabilities” in the post-trade business at the LSE and “dependency on certain not-always-ideal external suppliers” – a none-too subtle reference to LCH.Clearnet – had prevented the London bourse from “innovating successfully”, he said.The comments were taken as a sign that the LSE will build its own clearing house in London.Two months later, Mr Rolet quit the board of LCH.Clearnet. Around that time, he also hired Patrick Birley, a former head of LCH.Clearnet’s UK operations, as a consultant to advise on clearing strategy.By December it became public that Mr Birley and the LSE had parted ways, amid disagreement over what clearing strategy to pursue and how to go about it: whether to build its own clearer or take a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet – or do nothing.The “do nothing” option is what happened. In a way this was understandable. With so much in flux in market structures in Brussels – especially concerning clearing – a “wait and see” approach probably made sense. Who could say which way Emir would go in terms of the so-called “scope” issue?…Would the UK and others succeed in their efforts to have Emir’s scope expanded beyond OTC derivatives to listed derivatives, with all that implied for instilling competition in listed derivatives and between clearing houses in Europe?Then there was the uncertainty over “interoperability” in cash equities clearing in Europe. And in September last year Mr Rolet had started discussing a possible merger with his counterpart at TMX Group, operator of Canada’s main exchanges.Before the summer break wait-and-see no longer seemed viable, would be my guess. It became clear that the UK had probably been out-gunned on the scope issue (we will know for sure this week or next).With the failure of its Canadian adventure, it made sense for the LSE to move from “wait and see” to doing something.So does LCH.Clearnet make sense for the LSE? Yes. It gives the LSE a clearer in London, finally. Any exchange that hopes to enter new markets and innovate on product is handicapped without having its own clearing. That is especially relevant in derivatives, where the LSE is just out of the starting blocks with its Turquoise FTSE futures initiative.An acquisition of LCH.Clearnet also would also be immediately accretive to earnings, given the clearer’s large treasury business – the bread-and-butter of any clearing house. LCH.Clearnet earns 29 per cent of its revenues from lending out the collateral posted to it by market participants. Only 14 per cent comes from cash equities clearing (a rapidly commoditising business, in any case).Mr Rolet has shown that he can run a clearing house more efficiently in Italy. In May the LSE revealed a 30 per cent jump in income at the LSE group’s post-trade services business, mostly from its Italian clearing house. That was as a result of widening the group of local banks that Cassa uses to deposit margin funds in overnight, allowing it to negotiate more favourable euribor rates.But what about SwapClear, the over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps clearing service under LCH.Clearnet?While LCH.Clearnet books OTC derivatives revenues on its accounts from the SwapClear service, this does not tell the full story on where SwapClear profits go. Some go to the OTC derivatives dealer-banks that form a curious governance mechanism for SwapClear, known as OTCDerivNet. The amount of profit that goes to these banks is dictated by a sliding scale of thresholds set out in an arrangement between LCH.Clearnet and the banks, revised last year.It is a glass bead game that few even in the industry understand, but the bottom line is that any LSE deal with LCH.Clearnet would probably have to allow SwapClear to be ring-fenced somehow to allow the banks to carry on. I can’t see the SwapClear banks represented on the LCH.Clearnet board being enthusiastic, either, about exchange control of LCH.Clearnet (which is what you’d get if the LSE wants 51 per cent).This is one hurdle that Markit, the LSE’s rival bidder, does not face. Perhaps that is why the LSE has offered a knock-out €21 a share price for LCH.Clearnet, above Markit’s €15 offered for 100 per cent of LCH.Clearnet.The LSE can just about afford it. Barclays Capital calculates the LSE has £650-£700m of firepower. Depending on what LCH.Clearnet stake LSE acquires, it might need to issue “minimal new equity” to fund it.But even as I can make a case for the LSE’s interest in LCH.Clearnet, there is a more compelling overlap with Markit. Many of Markit’s shareholders are the same banks in OTCDerivNet; their interests are aligned. And Markit is at least a player in the OTC derivatives “plumbing” business that fits well with SwapClear. It also has a joint venture with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation – DerivSERV – which is at the heart of OTC derivatives processing already. Not to speak of a strong US presence, which is where SwapClear is in the midst of trying to gain traction with “buyside” clearing.We’ve been here before with the LSE, of course. The exchange was briefly a non-committal member of the “Lily” consortium, which included 14 banks and the inter-dealer broker Icap, and which bid for LCH.Clearnet in 2009.It seems this time things are serious. But for Mr Rolet’s sake, this big ticket deal had better work, since shareholders and the board may be less forgiving if, post-TMX, this venture fails as well."
750;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-02T16:15:26Z;LSE/LCH.Clearnet;Secret to exchange’s continued viability lies on its doorstep;"The London Stock Exchange has had its head turned for more than a decade by the lure of international alliances. Now it may be discovering that the secret to its continued viability lies on its doorstep, in the shape of the old London Clearing House. LSE is in talks with LCH.Clearnet; an offer could value the target at €1bn. A deal looks both do-able and sensible. What took the exchange so long to realise it?LSE is hampered by its lack of scale in clearing. That has allowed rivals such as Deutsche Börse and CME Group to dictate the shape and size of the exchanges industry. After the failed merger with the Toronto stock exchange, Xavier Rolet, LSE’s chief executive, needs to demonstrate that the exchange is back on the front foot. Clearing is where the action is, and LCH.Clearnet has a potential jewel in SwapClear, the clearing service for over-the-counter interest rate swaps, which is poised to benefit from regulatory reform that will see more trading switch to electronic platforms.Valuing LCH.Clearnet is tricky. A €1bn price tag looks high; it earned only €19m in net profit in 2010, and its earnings are very volatile. It is owned by about 100 financial institutions, so getting a unanimous sale agreement could be tough given the potential for conflicting agendas. UK post-trade services group Markit has already made an approach to LCH.Clearnet that values it at only half what the talk around the LSE move does.There is a risk that the exchange will overpay, especially if others join to create a bidding war. That helps to explain the 3 per cent drop in LSE’s share price on Friday.The LSE’s balance sheet is strong, however. Barclays Capital suggests that it could afford to pay up to £700m, or twice projected 2011 earnings: more than enough to acquire control. To secure a transaction with strategic benefits for the London markets, that may be a price worth paying."
751;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Rolet recovers from TMX to target LCH;;Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has kept a low profile since his attempt to merge the UK bourse with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s two main exchanges, collapsed in June.But this week it emerged that far from licking his wounds over the summer, he had been hatching another big deal. This time, it is close to home: the LSE wants to take control of LCH.Clearnet, the London clearing house that has long processed UK share trades for the exchange.Clearing may lack the glamour of trading, which is increasingly dominated by electronic technology. But it is rapidly becoming central to the business of any exchange.That is because its key function – to ensure that deals between two traders go ahead even if one side defaults – has been seized on by regulators as a way of helping to clean up the financial system in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.In addition, any exchange that owns its own clearing house can lock in extra revenues since clearers charge a fee every time a trade is processed, just as exchanges charge a fee every time a trade is carried out on its systems.The LSE is increasingly an odd man out in the exchange world. While it owns a clearing house in Italy through its ownership of Borsa Italiana, it does not have one in the UK, its most important market.Yet the LSE is set to be overshadowed in Europe by a planned combination of Deutsche Börse, the German exchange, and NYSE Euronext. The Börse has its own clearer, Eurex Clearing, which will only be strengthened as it starts to clear financial instruments known as derivatives that trade on NYSE Euronext’s futures platform, as well as its own.Moreover the LSE is increasingly surrounded by exchanges that own their own clearing.By acquiring LCH.Clearnet, the LSE would finally join a trend that has appeared unstoppable towards a “vertical silo” model, where trading and clearing is integrated into one business.Success for Mr Rolet with LCH.Clearnet would also benefit London as a financial centre, since its two most prized market infrastructures – the LSE and LCH.Clearnet – are strategically exposed as long as they remain independent, at a time when Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext are set to form the world’s largest exchange group with clear benefits for Frankfurt.The LSE has looked at acquiring LCH.Clearnet for at least a year. This is its second attempt at LCH.Clearnet after an earlier offer of €21 a share in May, made just before the TMX deal collapsed.Niki Beattie, managing director of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy, said that may have prompted Mr Rolet to rethink his strategy “In the game of survival, I don’t think they really have any choice,” she said.Yet an acquisition of LCH.Clearnet would not be an easy proposition. A rival bidder is already in place: Markit, a company that specialises in post-trade services and data in the off-exchange, or over-the-counter (OTC), derivatives markets. There have been off-and-on discussions between Markit and NYSE Euronext – which owns 9 per cent of LCH.Clearnet – and Nasdaq OMX, which has ambitions in London.LCH.Clearnet is also a complex business. While it is known for clearing share trades, the business that holds more potential is SwapClear, a service which clears a widely traded type of OTC derivatives known as interest rate swaps. That business is set for growth as post-crisis regulatory reforms require a wholesale shift of OTC derivatives into clearing to help safeguard the financial system from future crises. Yet the LSE is not involved in OTC derivatives.SwapClear is also run dominated by the big banks active in OTC derivatives, such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. The LSE would have to negotiate carefully with the banks, which are also among LCH.Clearnet’s shareholders.
752;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Construction orders for public projects plunge;;Construction companies felt the full force of the government’s austerity measures in the second quarter of the year as new orders for public building projects plunged.The total volume of new construction orders fell 16.3 per cent between the first and second quarters of the year to the lowest level since 1980, according to the Office of National Statistics. Orders for public housing fell by almost a third, as did orders for other public work projects (excluding infrastructure).“The construction sector faces an extremely challenging environment, which threatens to weigh down appreciably on activity over the coming months. In particular, the coalition government’s extended pruning of public spending will clearly limit expenditure on public buildings, schools, hospitals and infrastructure,” said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.New orders for infrastructure projects, which were not broken down into public and private orders, fell by 25.9 per cent from the previous quarter and were 44.2 per cent lower than the same quarter a year ago.Meanwhile, new private housing orders fell by 8 per cent. Orders for private industrial projects rose by 7 per cent and were the only category of orders that rose from the previous quarter.Separately, a purchasing managers’ survey of the construction industry suggested activity in the sector slowed last month but did not grind to a halt. The Markit/CIPS PMI index declined from 53.5 in July to 52.6 in August.The survey found that conditions in commercial industry were improving but that civil engineering work and house building were much weaker.Construction companies also reported that input price inflation had picked up again to a three-month high, which will put pressure on profit margins.Sarah Bingham, an economist at Markit, said: “Confidence regarding future business expectations weakened to an eight-month low, highlighting concerns in respect of further potential cuts in government spending, but also a dampening of wider business sentiment, which may act to reduce investment on construction projects.”
753;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-02T07:32:56Z;LSE in bid for majority of clearing house LCH;;The London Stock Exchange said on Friday it was in talks with LCH.Clearnet about a possible transaction involving the UK clearing house, raising the stakes in the battle for control of Europe’s last remaining independent clearing house.The disclosure came after the Financial Times reported that the LSE had made a bid for the London-based clearer, which would value it at around €1bn ($1.4bn).The move pits the LSE against Markit, a UK post-trade services group, for control of LCH.Clearnet, one of the most prized assets in the business of clearing equities and over-the-counter derivatives.It also comes as new regulations on derivatives emerging from Brussels and the prospect of a merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext are casting a cloud over the UK’s key market infrastructure operators – the LSE and LCH.Clearnet.If finalised, the German-US exchange merger would create the world’s largest exchange, which would dominate trading in derivatives contracts and the post-trade process of clearing that underpins such trading.That would overshadow the LSE, which has a fledgling derivatives business launched in June. Unlike many exchanges – including Deutsche Börse – the LSE lacks its own clearing house for its main share market.LSE shares fell 2 per cent on Friday to 912½p after it the exchange cautioned that talks were at an early stage and that “there can be no certainty that any action or agreement will result”.LCH.Clearnet on Thursday declined to comment.Many market participants are wary of increased exchange power through clearing and are eager to ensure that LCH.Clearnet – the only big clearer in Europe owned by customers – remains free of exchange control.Yet ownership of a clearing house is increasingly important to exchanges as they seek to lock in revenues from post-trade services.A clearing house stands between buyers and sellers, stepping in to ensure that a deal is completed if one party defaults. LCH.Clearnet was formed from a merger in 2003 between the London Clearing House and Clearnet, clearer for the Paris Bourse.The LSE uses LCH.Clearnet to clear UK stocks and for FTSE index futures. But it has no ownership of or board representation at LCH.Clearnet, which is owned 83 per cent by its bank and broker customers and 17 per cent by NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange.If the LSE succeeded in its bid, the UK bourse’s position would be significantly strengthened, while London could benefit from the creation of a large, integrated exchange group.The LSE’s move, which values the clearer at about €21 a share, is the second time the UK bourse has approached the clearing house since a bid in May, which was withdrawn as the LSE focused on its ultimately failed merger with TMX Group, the Canadian exchange operator.At the time LCH.Clearnet’s board was also presented with bids from Markit, a UK post-trade company, and a third offer involving Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator.Since then LCH.Clearnet’s board has been considering Markit’s offer, which was worth €10 a share when tabled. Markit has been working with both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX as possible partners in its approach for LCH.Clearnet, a second person said.Relations between the LSE and LCH.Clearnet, which had been strained, have improved in recent months since the arrival in April of Ian Axe, a former Barclays Capital banker, as the clearer’s chief executive. He is pushing through a radical restructuring of LCH.Clearnet in an attempt to make it more commercially driven.
754;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
755;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors may be right in betting against recession;The world economy is not as bad as it could be;Economists like to joke that Wall Street has predicted nine of the past five recessions. Equity investors seem to think they might have done it again. The peak-to-trough drop of 20 per cent in global share prices amounted to a firm forecast in early August that recession was on its way. Since then shares have jumped more than 9 per cent, as doubts grew about the extent of the slowdown.Thursday’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ indices sent a mixed message. The eurozone and UK, and China on one of its two measures, were below the crucial 50 mark separating expansion from contraction. The US came in at 50.6, but was still down (although better than feared).The details were more pessimistic still. Of 17 PMI indices produced by Markit, only Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic saw rising new orders. Most are back to levels last seen in 2009. Stocks of unsold goods in the eurozone are rising at the fastest since late 2008, and in Germany at the fastest since the series started 15 years ago.Investors have focused on the expansion or contraction of manufacturing as a vital indicator of economic health. But a low PMI is often a false signal, as is the gap between new orders and inventories.What matters to share prices is the turning point. The best one-year equity returns are often found as or just before the PMI hits bottom and starts to rise again, as in early 2009, spring 2003, or mid-1982.This is not one of those moments. Investors are betting that the deep recession feared early in August will not occur, or at least not soon. They may be right: fear was intense early in August, and if Europe manages to get just a few things right that fear would prove overdone.The best that can be said for equities is that the world economy is not as bad as it could be. Ironically, this could itself be bad for shares, if it reduces the pressure on central banks to ease further.
756;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-01T17:52:14Z;Get used to world without ‘risk free’ rate;Rethink may be needed on cherished investment model;"Earlier this week, I pointed out in a column that the cost of insuring the US government against default in the credit derivatives markets is now higher than for many major companies. More specifically, data from Markit shows that no less than 70 US corporate names currently command lower credit default swap spreads than the sovereign contract (currently running at 50 basis points.) A few years ago, there were none.Unsurprisingly, that observation prompted a flurry of e-mails: some readers suggested that this pattern simply demonstrated what a poor guide CDS prices can be; others argued that it showed instead what a poor job American politicians were doing in relation to US debt.However, one of the most interesting observations came from Bruce Tozer, a senior official at Crédit Agricole Investment Bank, who suggested that the most important aspect of this swing is that it should force investors to rethink their concept of the “risk free” rate.More specifically, in recent decades, western investors and asset managers have been raised to assume that the US Treasury yield was the “risk free” benchmark, against which other assets could be measured; this consequently formed the bedrock for their investment approaches, such as their use of the capital asset pricing model.But, these CDS swings, Tozer adds, raise three questions: firstly, can we really consider Treasuries an appropriate “risk free” rate today?Secondly, is this concept of “risk free” even appropriate in today’s world?And thirdly – and most crucially – if the answer to the first two questions is “no”, then what “does that mean for portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model?”It is worth considering each of these three questions in turn, since they are absolutely fundamental.On the first issue – namely whether US Treasuries really offer a good “risk-free” rate – I personally think that there does need to be an investment rethink. On paper, the idea that the US would actually default on its debts currently looks odd; quite apart from the fact that the dollar is the world’s reserve currency, the US fiscal problems would not be impossible to solve if only politicians could produce an intelligent, collaborative fiscal plan.But therein lies the rub: what matters in the US today is not economic and financial volatility, but rising political volatility too. Hence the fact that S&P recently downgraded US debt (entirely understandably, in my view); and the widening of those CDS spreads.Of course, some observers might retort that even amid these woes, the US still looks less risky than most rivals. True enough. Japan’s debt to gross domestic product ratio, after all, is heading over 200 per cent. Germany’s fiscal situation is better, but clouded by turmoil in the eurozone. And while a country such as Switzerland is now being treated by investors as a safe haven, its bond markets are too small to provide any alternative “risk free” benchmarks.And there are not many obvious candidates elsewhere. At a meeting of chief investment officers that I attended in New York, for example, some CIOs suggested – half in jest – that the investment community should start asking whether some large companies (such as IBM) could provide an alternative benchmark. Another leading CIO proposed coal as the best new risk free asset: after all, he argued, coal (unlike food) does not depreciate over time; however, it (unlike gold) has a tangible use that transcends cultures.But unless asset managers are ready to start loading up on the black stuff, the more realistic conclusion is that we could be moving into a world where there is no real “risk free” rate at all. If so, as Tozer says, it may now also be time to recognise that all of those capital asset pricing model techniques to which 20th century finance was so addicted need to be reconsidered too.Would that be such a bad thing? Some might argue not. After all, as Emanuel Derman, the well-respected financial “quant”, argues in a powerful book that will be published next month, while models are essential for the modern world, they are always illusory to some degree*. And in the case of that “risk free” benchmark, that always incorporated some element of fiction. If the current debate about US debt – and the CDS spreads – is now forcing investors to clearly recognise this, then it might be a positive thing in a long term.But in the short term, at least the main impact of these swings is that it has left many investors feeling profoundly uneasy, albeit in ways that they cannot always articulate. After all, nobody likes losing their long-cherished compass, when the landscape around them looks scary; risk is a four-letter word.*Models Behaving Badly is being published by Free Press on October 25 in the US and Canada, and by Wiley in the UKgillian.tett@ft.com"
757;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Spanish bond yields fall in auction;;Spain’s treasury sold €3.6bn of five-year sovereign bonds at moderate yields, amid continuing unease in eurozone financial markets over the creditworthiness of Spain and Italy.The average yield of the issue at Thursday’s auction was 4.489 per cent, less costly for Spain than the 4.871 per cent recorded at the previous sale of paper with the same five-year term on July 7.In the latest auction, however, Spain sold an amount just above the midpoint of its desired range of €3bn-€4bn with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.8, indicating only modest demand from investors.The European Central Bank, provoking criticism from policymakers in Germany and elsewhere, has been buying Spanish and Italian bonds in the secondary market to support prices following a sharp spike in yields at the start of August.Traders estimated that the ECB bought about €10bn in Spanish and Italian bonds on Thursday.One said: “Without the ECB buying, Spanish and Italian bonds would have seen a bit of a sell-off. There is no one out there who wants to buy them today apart from the central bank.”Spanish 10-year bond yields held steady at 5.05 per cent while Italian yields were also stable at 5.15 per cent.The ECB has agreed to intervene in the markets in return for further commitments from Italy and Spain to cut their budget deficits, control their debt and reform their economies.José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Spain’s socialist prime minister, hurriedly liberalised the labour market in an attempt to reduce unemployment among the young and agreed with the opposition Popular party on constitutional reforms that would entrench budgetary stability from 2020.The rapid introduction of this constitutional amendment – only the second in Spain’s post-Franco history – has prompted complaints from leftwingers, including some members of the governing socialists, and regional nationalist parties.However, the government aims to have the change approved by parliament this month.In the meantime, the government insists it will meet its target of cutting the public sector deficit to 6 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 9.2 per cent in 2010, although on Thursday it backed away from plans to reintroduce a new form of wealth tax before a general election called for November 20.José Blanco, public works minister and government spokesman, did not rule out reviving a tax on assets abandoned in 2008, although he said there was no time to pass a completely new wealth tax in the current parliament.“Now there is a commitment from the PSOE [the socialist party] to include it in its election manifesto,” he said.As well as trying to cut spending and increase revenues, Spain is struggling to prevent the economy falling back into recession.August figures from Markit’s purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing companies showed activity contracting for the fourth month in a row.“The latest economic data and survey evidence have shown a steady weakening, suggesting that Spain’s economic woes are intensifying again,” said Raj Badiani, economist at IHS Global Insight.Additional reporting by David Oakley in London
758;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-09-01T10:07:20Z;Manufacturing adds to economic gloom;;British manufacturing activity contracted for a second successive month in August, according to a closely watched survey that suggested conditions in the sector would continue to worsen.The UK Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 49 in August from a revised 49.4 in July – the weakest level since June 2009. Any number under 50 indicates a contraction in activity. Beneath the main index, the production and export orders indices both fell to their lowest levels since May 2009.Even though manufacturing accounts for only 13 per cent of gross domestic product, a rapid rebound in the sector last year helped drive the economic recovery. Signs that the sector has shifted into reverse will exacerbate concerns that the economy as a whole is weakening.“The speed with which the growth has slowed since the start of the year is really quite alarming,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which gathers the PMI data. However, he noted that the sector is not shrinking at anywhere near the rate it was at the height of the recession. The index bottomed at 35 in February 2009.Economists had expected the index to drop to 49 but they were concerned by some of the details of the survey, which suggested activity was likely to fall further. There was a very sharp fall in the new export orders index, for example, from 53.8 in July to 46.6 in August.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said there were reports of lower demand in crucial markets across mainland Europe, Ireland and the US. Global PMI surveys on Thursday showed manufacturing has slowed or contracted in many of the Asia’s export powerhouses as well as in Europe.“The global economic slowdown is coming at an unfortunate time for the UK,” said Philip Rush, economist at Nomura. “Domestic factors had been depressing growth through the winter and spring, but its slow recovery since is being blunted by the bleak external environment.”Manufacturers reported lower production in the transport, timber, paper, chemicals and plastics sectors.They also reported a rise in their stocks of finished goods for the first time in more than three years. Economists often compare the volume of goods piled up in warehouses to the amount of orders coming in. In August, the rise in stocks combined with the fall in orders suggests manufacturers will need to cut production further in the coming months.Employment declined in August for the first time in almost a year and a half, though at a gentle pace.On the positive side, inflationary pressures appeared to ease substantially. While input prices continued to rise in August, they did so at the slowest rate for 20 months, the survey suggested. Output prices rose at their slowest rate for nine months. That should give some relief to the Bank of England, which thinks that high annual inflation is a temporary phenomenon and has signalled it will not raise interest rates any time soon.
759;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-29T17:07:36Z;Sovereign spreads challenging cherished notions;Seventy large US companies now considered better credit bet than state;"A few years ago, I pointed out in a column that the cost of insuring the US government against a default in the credit derivatives market, had risen above that of McDonalds, the US fast food company, for the first time.Back then, in 2008, it seemed a shocking development. After all, Western finance has traditionally assumed that governments were the safest entities in the markets; indeed the yield on US Treasuries was considered the “risk free” benchmark. Thus paying more to insure loans to Uncle Sam than those to Ronald McDonald (or any other company) seemed distinctly bizarre.No longer. At the end of last week, trading in the credit derivatives markets implied that no less than 70 large US companies are now considered a better credit bet than the American government, according to Markit data. More specifically, the cost of insuring US government bonds against default for five years is currently trading around 50 basis points (meaning it costs $50,000 a year to insure against default for $10m of bonds), while the cost is less than 30bp for companies such as AT&T, New Cingular Wireless and Oracle. The spread for Google, HP, Coca Cola – and, yes, McDonald’s – is also well below the sovereign spread.And this is not just an American pattern: the credit default swap spreads for Telefonica and Iberdrola in Spain, for example, are also now well below that of their government. The idea that large companies are safer than governments, in other words, is no longer such a bizarre aberration in the derivatives world; on the contrary, it is almost accepted.Now some people might argue that this simply shows the danger of relying on CDS as a credit guide. After all, the market for many CDS contracts is thin. Thus prices can be erratic. Indeed, Creditsights, an industry newsletter, reckons that at present only eight US CDS contracts currently have net notional values in the market of more than $5bn, and just 27 more than $2bn.However, the CDS world is not the only place where the relative safety of companies and governments is changing. When Standard & Poor’s, the US rating agency, removed the AAA rating from US sovereign debt two weeks ago, for example, it left the AAA rating for four US companies unchanged. Thus Automatic Data Processing, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft are now rated higher than their own government – a pattern that used to be largely seen just in emerging markets.And if you dig into the reasons why those CDS rankings have changed – or why S&P left those four American companies rated above the government – it reveals some fascinating longer-term structural shifts. One way to read this trend is that it presents a verdict on relative levels of corporate governance, and transparency. More specifically, the reason why so many large companies command tight CDS spreads is that investors feel confident that they understand their balance sheets, and that these entities have plenty of cash on hand, and tangible, easily tracked revenues.Sadly, however, many public entities currently lack that sense of transparency; on the contrary, it is painfully hard to disentangle where the liabilities and tangible assets lie. Hence the high(ish) level of CDS spreads for US Treasuries: although investors know that America is highly unlikely to default on its bonds, the political climate is so volatile that it is hard to predict cash flows. However, a second factor is the issue of globalisation. Most of America’s best-run and healthiest companies these days are not really “American” anymore; on the contrary, they draw a growing proportion of their revenues from outside America’s shores, and hold vast pots of cash overseas.That gives them the ability to hedge themselves against an American, or Western, economic downturn; or, to put it another way, they can flee, with their cash if economic or political circumstances turn sour. So can many “European” companies; just look, for example, at the global nature of “Greek” shipping lines, or those “Irish” information technology groups. However, that option is not open to public sector entities; for better or worse, their credit risk is tethered to the West.Now, this swing may yet turn out to be temporary. And it should be noted it has not really affected actual funding costs yet: irrespective of CDS prices, the US government is still able to borrow money in the bond markets more cheaply than large American companies, including the 70 which now have tighter spreads. But, if nothing else, that 70-strong list shows again the degree to which the fall-out from the financial crisis is challenging some cherished 20th century ideas in finance. Investors should take note. Not to mention Western politicians.The writer is the FT’s US managing editorgillian.tett@ft.com"
760;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-23T17:30:11Z;Equity market stress gauges show signs of trouble;;If traders had any doubt that the 2011 summer risk asset storm was simply a squall within a bull market, that should have been dispelled by the severity of the move. At its worst point on Monday, the FTSE All-World equity index was nearly back in bear market territory, having lost 19.7 per cent since its cyclical peak in May.But what also makes the recent turmoil worrying is the accompanying deterioration in some of the stress gauges that during previous wobbles over the past year or so have proved fairly resolute.One of Trading Post’s favourites is the US two-year swap spread (2YSS), which is used as a barometer of credit risk. The 2YSS barely twitched when equities fell after the Japanese earthquake in March, but its move above 30 basis points to its highest level in more than a year signals that the market senses a weakening in corporate fundamentals.Similar anxiety can be seen in the interbank markets, particularly in Europe.But the worries are not confined to the continent’s financial sector. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of mainly junk rated debt spreads has gone above the 700 basis point mark for the first time since 2009.
761;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-23T16:55:05Z;Confidence drains from consumers in eurozone;;Eurozone consumer optimism has plummeted this month at the fastest rate for 20 years, while manufacturing contracted for the first time in two years, according to surveys that indicated economic growth across the region would remain at near stagnation.The European Commission said its consumer confidence indicator fell 5.4 points to minus 16.6 in August – a larger monthly fall than was seen in October 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.The sharp deterioration to the lowest level since June last year suggested the eurozone debt crisis and worries about global prospects had darkened the economic mood even more than economists had feared.Separately, purchasing managers’ indices showed private sector activity barely rose in August as German prospects weakened again, adding to the difficulties facing the region’s leaders as they try to restore confidence in the monetary union.“Most worrying is the near-stagnation in Germany, which suggests that the region’s main engine of growth has stalled,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices. German service sector expectations about prospects registered the biggest monthly drop since the survey began in mid-1997, Markit said.German investor confidence has also fallen sharply this month, the Mannheim-based ZEW economic institute reported. Its “economic sentiment” index plunged 22.5 points to minus 37.6 in August – the lowest since December 2008.However, the eurozone still seems some way from sliding back into recession. The purchasing managers’ indices showed a slight but unexpected reacceleration in French private sector activity in August. Overall, the indices have yet to see falls as steep as those that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.“I think we will avoid a double dip,” said Marco Valli, an economist at Unicredit in Milan. “A lot depends on financial markets, but if we don’t see a further escalation of tensions, and given our view that global trade will not fall off a cliff, I think we’re in a good position to avoid negative growth.”Germany’s Ifo business survey, released on Wednesday, will show how much the mood has deteriorated in its industrial sector.Led by Germany, the eurozone economy grew strongly at the start of this year, but has since slowed markedly, hit by fiscal austerity measures across the continent and weaker global growth.Data last week showed German gross domestic product expanded just 0.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first. Eurozone GDP increased 0.2 per cent over the same period.The latest purchasing managers’ indices suggested growth in the third quarter could prove even weaker.The “composite” index, covering services and manufacturing, stood at 51.1 in August, unchanged from July’s level, but otherwise the lowest for almost two years. The manufacturing index dropped from 50.4 to 49.7 in August – falling below the 50 level, which marks the boundary between expansion and contraction, for the first time since September 2009.This week, the Bundesbank forecast Germany’s economy would continue to grow in the second half of 2011, though “somewhat more slowly”. But it also foresaw a “range of global risk factors” – including worries about the US economy, a slowdown in emerging markets and financial market nervousness.
762;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-17T10:37:23Z;Jobless rise fuels fears over UK recovery;;Britain’s unemployment rate nudged upwards in the three months to June, while the number of people claiming jobless benefits rose at the fastest monthly rate since May 2009 when the nation was still mired in recession.According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK unemployment rate rose to 7.9 per cent in the three months to the end of June, from 7.8 per cent in the January to March period. A total of 2.49m people were out of work during the period, up from 2.45m in the three months to May.The number of those claiming jobseeker’s allowance rose by 37,100, much more than the roughly 20,000 rise economists had expected, and the number of women claiming this benefit rose to its highest level since April 1996 – a trend that economists believe reflects the reduction in public sector jobs where women are more likely to find work.The latest figures are likely to add to the growing concern among members of the Bank of England’s interest rate setting committee which warned about the growing threat to the UK from the slowing global economy in the latest minutes from the last monetary policy committee meeting.The figures will also increase pressure on David Cameron who was hoping a private-sector led recovery would offset a programme of government spending cuts in the public sector. But the UK economy has barely grown over the past nine months as the cuts begin to take effect.Stephen Timms, a former Treasury minister, said the rise in jobless figures should force the government to “think again” about its economic strategy.“The figures are very worrying, a big rise in unemployment, a big rise in the number of people receiving benefits and now the largest number of women unemployed for 23 years,” said the Labour MP. “And what I think it reflects is the way the economy has flatlined over the past nine months. We’re just not seeing the jobs created that we need.”Mr Timms said the high level of youth unemployment could have “very damaging long-term consequences” for the individuals and for the economy as a whole.Labour claimed that the rise in unemployment had helped to increase the benefits bill over this Parliament by more than £12bn – the equivalent of £500 for every household in the country.Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, called on George Osborne, chancellor, come up with a “plan B” for his management of the economy.“Today’s rise in unemployment points to a worrying deterioration in the UK labour market. And with our so-called recovery stagnating, all the indicators point to further rises in joblessness.“The chancellor urgently needs to put forward a plan B before our economy heads back towards recession and even more people lose their jobs.”Neville Hill, an economist at Credit Suisse, said the rise in the number of people seeking jobless benefits was consistent with a recession.“In general, these data suggest a deteriorating labour market, consistent with an economy that has recently slowed to a below-trend rate,” he said.Economic growth in the UK totalled just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter and has been revised down to 1.7 per cent for the year by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But growth elsewhere in Europe was slower in the second quarter. The German economy expanded by 0.1 per cent in the same period and French output was stagnant as the global economy slowed.Mr Osborne admitted the unemployment figures were “disappointing’’, but said that given what was happening in the global economy they were “not entirely unexpected’’. He pointed out that there was “some good news that employment, those in work, is still going up, “ adding: “We are creating jobs in this economy as well as jobs being lost.”Mr Osborne on Sunday defended his handling of the economy in an article in the Financial Times co-authored with the finance ministers of Canada, South Africa, Singapore and Australia. He called on governments around the world to cut public spending and bring down public deficits.“Hard decisions on spending, entitlements and taxes in countries with large budget deficits are unavoidable,” the article said.But Chris Williamson, UK economist at Markit which produces indices of purchasing manager sentiment for various sectors, said businesses remained uncertain about the outlook and that was dragging down the prospects for the employment market.“Business confidence clearly needs to rise before employment growth will pick up again, but at the moment the surveys suggest that companies remain worried about economic growth both at home and abroad and are generally erring towards cost-cutting rather than expansion.”The figures also showed few signs that high inflation is feeding into pay packets. When bonus payments are stripped out, regular pay showed a rise of 2.2 per cent on the year, roughly where it has been for months and far below the current consumer price inflation rate of 4.4 per cent. When bonuses were included, pay rose somewhat faster, up 2.6 per cent on the year.
763;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-15T18:28:48Z;Turmoil darkens the mood for corporate debt;;Falling borrowing costs, subdued default rates and healthy issuance created a robust start to the year for corporate credit markets but mounting fears over the eurozone debt crisis and tepid global economic growth have darkened the mood.Benchmark interest rates have continued to drop but this month’s markets turmoil has sent spreads higher on both investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt, the riskiest part of the market.Although the strongest companies still enjoy rock-bottom borrowing costs, thanks to falling base rates, many others may now find funding conditions tougher and more expensive than previously envisaged.This could crimp corporate dealmaking and investments, endanger weaker companies that face coming loan and bond repayments and have a negative knock-on effect on stalling global economic growth.Europe has been particularly badly hit.Sentiment improved on Monday but only after the Markit iTraxx index that follows the credit default swaps of European investment grade debt had risen above 150 basis points, and the Crossover index, which tracks riskier high-yield bonds, breached 600bp. Both gauges reached their highest since the financial crisis of 2008-09.US debt markets have also been rattled in spite of a deeper and more resilient investor base. Markit’s North American investment-grade index hit a one-year high of about 115 basis points, while the equivalent high-yield index climbed above 650 basis points.The turmoil has already started to affect debt sales. Issuance always lessens significantly over the summer but this year the slowdown has been even more marked.Global sales of investment-grade bonds have fallen to $19bn so far this month – down more than two-thirds from July’s $60.3bn issuance and less than half the volume over the same period in August 2010, according to Dealogic.Companies judged as below investment grade by the leading rating agencies, or junk, have only sold $762m of high-yield bonds so far in August, down from last month’s $24.8bn total, and only 4 per cent of the amount raised in the same period last year.“High-yield investors are taking a pause to reflect right now,” says Michael Moravec, co-head of European leveraged finance at Barclays Capital.It is not only bond investors who have turned more cautious.The volume of leveraged loans and investment-grade syndicated loans, the latter mostly supplied by banks, have so far in August dropped to $12.7bn and $24.7bn, respectively, less than half the sums raised over the same period of August 2010, according to Dealogic.Although many bankers remain hopeful of a resurgence in bond sales in September – when the market traditionally reopens after the summer – the outlook has been tarnished by heavy redemptions from many fixed-income funds in recent weeks.High-yield funds and Europe bond funds have been particularly badly hit.The former nearly doubled their previous weekly outflow record in the week ending August 10 and the latter reported outflows for the 28th time in the 32 weeks so far this year, according to EPFR Global.Overall, $10.4bn was last week yanked out of bond funds tracked by EPFR.Even emerging market bond funds that have proved popular with investors for most of the year snapped a 19-week streak of net inflows.“The tug-of-war between hunger for yield and fear of risk evident among bond investors for much of 2011 swung decisively in favour of fear during early August,” the data provider said in its report.The corporate debt outlook is not unremittingly dark. The corporate debt outlook is not unremittingly dark. The US market has shown far greater resilience on debt sales – investment grade issuance by US corporates totalled $7.3bn last week, the highest weekly volume since May, Dealogic said. On Monday, AT&T sold $5bn of bonds with the lowest coupon rates ever for the company.Elsewhere, many investors will be tempted by the returns currently on offer in parts of the “bombed-out” secondary market, which is pricing in an unrealistic amount of stress and defaults, bankers and analysts argue.US junk bond spreads, for example, now indicate a 50 per cent chance of recession, according to Martin Fridson, global credit strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.The likelihood of low policy rates in the US and Europe could mean that investors eventually tire of the low yields offered in safe assets such as money market funds, leading to a resumption of the “hunt for yield” that brought down borrowing costs earlier this year.“The market will continue to be unstable …[but] people still need to put money to work,” says Richard Bartlett, head of corporate debt capital markets at Royal Bank of Scotland.Corporate bonds will also benefit from the questionable allure of other asset classes, bankers argue. “Debt is still the least smelly shirt in the closet,” one senior banker points out.Analysts and bankers predict that the past two weeks’ mayhem will still result in a bifurcated market – where investment-grade debt remains relatively resilient but high-yield debt continues to be vulnerable.“Well-known, highly rated companies can still do deals, even in this environment,” says Jean-Marc Mercier, global head of debt syndicate at HSBC.The outlook for high-yield debt is murkier. Although spreads in the secondary market may tighten from their current levels, many bankers say investors will only selectively buy into new deals. “If you’re a high-yield company, your access will be questionable,” warns Matt King, global head of credit products strategy at Citi.
764;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-07T23:02:04Z;Survey signals uneven UK recovery;London is expanding faster than the regions;Economic activity is expanding at a far faster pace in London than in the regions, a survey of purchasing managers has found.The Lloyds TSB/ Markit regional poll of purchasing managers showed a reading of 59.5 for July in London – a 16-month high – against a national average of 54.6. The national average was the highest since April. A reading of more than 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The gap between the fastest and slowest growing regions is now the widest it has been for over two years.John Maltby of Lloyds TSB Commercial said: “London is advancing clear of the pack, the south and Midlands following behind, and the northern regions along with the south-west moving into the slow lane.”The reading for the north-west was 50.3, down from 54.3 in June. The south-west reading was 50.7, down from 50.8 the previous month.The picture for Northern Ireland was even more bleak, with a reading of 43.9 indicating that activity contracted last month. Activity expanded in Scotland and Wales, with figures of 53.5 and 52.7 respectively.Mr Maltby said the disparities reflected different regions’ exposure to high-growth export markets, sensitivity to government spending patterns and weak consumer spending.Employment grew in seven of the nine regions, with the north-west and Yorkshire & Humber the two regions recording declines. However, job creation in many other regions was only marginal. “The weakening employment trends across the majority of regions underline the increasing nervousness about the economic outlook, although lower input-price inflation has provided some respite,” Mr Maltby said.Commercial and residential rents have also reflected the disparity between the recovery in London and the regions.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said last month that offices were emptying across the northern regions. Residential rent inflation in London has outpaced price increases in the regions.
765;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-03T10:24:21Z;Services data temper gloom on UK economy;;"The expansion in activity in Britain’s service sector accelerated in July, beating expectations and providing a welcome boost to the growth outlook following a dismal reading for manufacturing earlier this week.The closely watched Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers in the services industry, which accounts for about 70 per cent of all private sector output, hit a four-month high of 55.4 in July against forecasts of a slight slowdown from the June reading of 53.9. A figure above 50 indicates activity is expanding.George Buckley of Deutsche Bank termed it “a highly respectable number”.Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the survey provided “a very welcome and important upside surprise.” It was, he said, “a significant boost to third-quarter prospects”.Activity was supported by gains in new business orders, which rose to 55.6 – above the long-term average for the series – with panellists reporting improved demand and market conditions.However, employment contracted slightly for the first time since April. Work outstanding also contracted, though at the same pace as in June.Business services and IT & Computing gained the most. Activity fell in the financial intermediation; hotels, catering and restaurants; and personal services categories.The services survey, which has registered an expansion in activity for every month this year, contrasts with an altogether more bleak picture for manufacturing. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, released on Monday, showed activity contracted in July, with a reading of 49.1.The services PMI for the eurozone, also out on Wednesday, fell to 51.6 last month from 53.7 in June.Alan Clarke of Scotia Capital said the UK figure was “all the more encouraging” when set against the fall in the eurozone. “Looking at this with a glass half full, the services sector which accounts for the biggest share of the economy is expanding at a respectable pace,” Mr Clarke said."
766;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-02T13:57:30Z;Construction sector offers glimmer of hope;;Britain’s construction sector expanded at a steady rate in July although employment fell for the second month in a row, according to an industry survey.The construction purchasing managers’ index remained below the long-run trend, edging down from 53.6 in June in the report from Markit, a research company and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.The survey reflected “solid” growth in order books and a slight improvement in confidence. The findings came in slightly above expectations and were greeted with relief by analysts, as they followed a series of disappointing data.Civil engineering recorded the sharpest expansion, while the rate of increase in commercial activity fell slightly. Residential construction contracted for a second consecutive month, but at a marginal rate.David Noble, CIPS’ chief executive said: “A continued rise in new orders suggests that activity should be supported in the near-term, but confidence regarding potential activity growth for the next year remains relatively subdued.”Sarah Bingham, economist at Markit, said that “The subdued level of confidence regarding future business expectations reflects the challenging outlook for the UK economy, and therefore the construction sector.’’
767;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-01T18:23:36Z;IMF casts doubt on UK deficit plan;;Bad economic news bombarded the Treasury on Monday as new International Monetary Fund forecasts cast doubt on the chancellor’s deficit reduction plan, while near-term indicators suggested the recovery was losing the little momentum it had.The IMF judged that Britain’s economy had less capacity to grow quickly over the next few years than the government had hoped, slowing the reduction in borrowing to the point where it comes within a whisker of missing George Osborne’s main fiscal target.Instead of eliminating his preferred measure of the deficit with billions to spare a year before the next election, Ajai Chopra, the IMF mission chief to the UK warned that the chancellor’s “mandate is met with a very slim margin”, raising the possibility that further spending cuts and tax rises would be needed.The IMF assessment came as figures showed manufacturing activity had all but ground to a halt as the third quarter started. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.1 in July from 51.4 in June. The weakness persuaded investors that the Bank of England was extremely unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future, pushing the UK’s benchmark borrowing costs close to their lowest levels.Yields on 10-year Gilts fell to 2.797 per cent, just above their all-time low of 2.794 per cent from last August and far below their level as recently as February when they were at 3.89 per cent.Presenting the IMF’s annual health check on the UK economy, Mr Chopra stuck to his initial view from June that there was no need yet for any change in the government’s austerity drive, but it should be ready to alter its strategy as circumstances unfolded, he added.The Treasury latched on to this support with a spokesperson saying: “The IMF has again endorsed Britain’s strategy for reducing our deficit and dealing with our debt”.Most worrying for households was the Fund’s new assessment that structural unemployment is significantly higher than the OBR believes. Drawing on evidence from the past economic cycle, it estimated a long-term unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent or 2.2m people, nearly 300,000 more than the official estimate of 1.9m or 5.25 per cent of the labour force.With the IMF expecting the economy to struggle to reduce unemployment, deficit reduction becomes more difficult and the experts from Washington estimate the current structural budget will only just crawl into surplus in 2015-16 by 0.1 per cent of national income.Mr Chopra refused to endorse Labour’s Plan B of immediate tax cuts. Only if the economy appeared “likely to experience a prolonged period of weak growth and high unemployment” should monetary policy be loosened and the government consider temporary tax cuts.Additional reporting by Richard Milne
768;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-08-01T15:11:06Z;UK manufacturing shrinks in July;;UK manufacturing contracted unexpectedly in July, according to a survey, the first such decline in more than two years, while new orders posted their second decline in the past three months. The report underlines the problems facing the government as it aims to ‘rebalance’ the economy towards manufacturing.The Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index headline reading stood at 49.1, below the reading of 50 which signals that a sector is in a steady state. Economists had expected a reading of 51. New orders stood at 47.58, the fastest decline since May 2009 when Britain was still mired in recession.Sterling fell on the news and gilt futures rose as the chances of an interest rate rise appeared to move further into the future.The readings come on the heels of a similar survey from the CBI last week that showed that manufacturing – so far the stellar performer in an otherwise weak economy – to be slowing significantly, with employers curbing their plans to hire workers and invest in their businesses.The survey contained several pieces of good news. The input prices index slowed to its lowest rate since December 2009, a trend that Markit said reflected recent falls in the prices of plastics and steel. The reading for new export orders rose to 53.73, up from 51.02 in June, with companies reporting increased orders from Australia, east Asia, China and the US.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, noted that the data show a marked turnround from levels seen at the start of the year. “Growth of output reached a near standstill following the steepest decline in new orders for over two years, while payroll numbers were lowered for the first time since March 2010,” Mr Dobson said.Even taking the bounce in export orders into account, overall new orders slowed significantly, and backlogs of work continued to fall, despite the reduction in staffing levels. Overall employment contracted, registering a reading of 49.1, the first such decline since December 2009. Employment growth has been declining since March of this year.George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank, noted that the headline index was 13 points below where it stood at the start of this year and about 2.5 points below its long-run average, while the new orders sub-component was 5.0 points below its long-run average. “The one ray of hope is that the weak pound is supporting exports,” Mr Buckley said.
769;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-27T18:54:22Z;Insurance cost against US default hits record;;The cost of buying insurance against a default by the US rose to a record on Wednesday, in a sign of growing unease that gridlock in Washington over raising the federal debt ceiling may result in the Treasury failing to pay interest to bondholders.The market for buying and selling insurance on the creditworthiness of the US is thinly traded, denominated in euros and dominated by European and UK banks in London. But trading in so-called credit default swaps has picked up as the threat of a default has grown.In a CDS, a buyer of protection is compensated by the seller should there be a default or missed payment, known as a “credit event”.“The US CDS market is much less liquid than other sovereign markets as up until recently no one thought the chance of a US credit event was very high,” said Ira Jersey, strategist at Credit Suisse. “The market is getting nervous over the risk of a default.”Premiums for one-year US sovereign CDS rose sharply this week and traded at about 90 basis points in London on Wednesday, overtaking the previous high set in March 2009.In a sign of greater concern of a near-term default, US one-year CDS was trading higher than premiums for the more liquid five-year sector, at about 65bp, for the first time.Otis Casey, director of credit research at Markit, said: “Typically you see an inversion of the short end in [issuers] that are fairly well distressed.”The net size of the US CDS market, or actual market exposure, is $4.9bn. The US has risen above Greece’s $4.6bn in net exposure but is below the UK’s net size of $12.3bn, according to data at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp.Analysts said that, given the cost of buying protection for one year and the risk of the Treasury missing a debt payment in the next month, there is potentially a massive pay-out for investors under that scenario.But that must be weighed against the likelihood that the debt ceiling is raised and the prospect that the Treasury would strive to make good on its obligations during the three-day grace period before a credit event was officially called.Later on Wednesday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association released guidance on common questions about a possible US default. On Monday, ISDA posted an updated Q&A for Greek sovereign debt on its website.In the case of the US, a credit event would occur if the Treasury failed to make a payment on government bonds. In that situation, a committee under the auspices of the ISDA would rule that a default event had occurred only if the payment had not been made after a three-day grace period. At that point, US CDS trades would be triggered and then settled.In the event of a US credit event, the buyers of CDS would locate the February 2039 Treasury bond, currently priced at less than $88, and deliver that to the writers of insurance and receive $100 back, or par.At current levels, for a $10m trade in CDS, that would generate a return of more than $1m, said Mr Jersey.The US CDS market is defined by a smaller number of trades but much larger notional sizes when compared with other sovereign credits. There is a gross outstanding of $27bn in US for 1,063 trades, equating to an average trade size of $25m, whereas for the UK there is $66bn in outstanding notional volume for 4,789 trades, or $14m per average trade size.
770;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-27T16:37:58Z;Nasdaq downplays acquisition talk;;Nasdaq OMX has played down investor expectations that it might make a large acquisition as the US exchange operator reported higher second-quarter earnings that beat market expectations.The comments by Robert Greifeld, chief executive, come after weeks of speculation that Nasdaq might be tempted to make a move on the London Stock Exchange, after the collapse of the UK bourse’s attempted merger with TMX Group of Canada.“As we evaluate current valuations in the marketplace today, including our own, we realise that there are a number of external and internal alternatives for capital deployment that we need to consider in order to maximise returns for our shareholders,” Mr Greifeld told analysts on a conference call. “To the extent that external alternatives do not generate adequate returns, we will remain focused on the substantial organic opportunities to generate attractive returns on capital.”Asked later by the Financial Times if that would apply in the case of any bid for the LSE, Mr Greifeld said: “It constraints what we can do, yes.”Nasdaq reported a rise in net income to $112m, compared with $108m the previous year’s quarter, and diluted earnings per share of 62 cents, compared with 52 cents last time.That was helped by better than expected revenues of $416m, a rise of 7 per cent over the same period a year earlier.Nasdaq’s share of US equity trading fell to 22 per cent, from 22.8 per cent in the second quarter last year, pulling down the amount that Nasdaq earned from charging fees each time a trade is done to $59m.But it more than made up for that by growing its options market shares and revenues, and through earnings from a relatively new business area called “market services”.That includes a suite of businesses associated with being involved in equity markets beyond pure matching of trades on the exchange – which Nasdaq calls “the match”. They include pre-trade risk management, real time” market surveillance, and collocation, which allows traders to place their computers next to an exchange’s matching system to cut trading times.Mr Greifeld said: “It’s the first quarter we’re saying ‘you can’t really think of the equity business as really being just the match’.”He said that as a result the yield achieved per matched trade had risen as revenues had come in from services such as FTEN, a pre-trade risk management company acquired last year, and Smarts, a real-time surveillance company which Nasdaq also bought last year.“Over the past four years, the total yield per matched trade has grown by 25 per cent, despite the fact that the rate on the pure match has declined slightly,” Mr Greifeld said.The increased cash flow had allowed Nasdaq to cut its net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to 2.1 times, from 2.3 times. Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, said: “Sustained strong cash flow will allow us to continue to deleverage and put us in a position to explore efficient capital allocation alternatives as the year progresses.”In spite of playing down a large exchange acquisition, Nasdaq is nonetheless pursuing a bid for a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house in which Markit, a post-trade services company, and Nasdaq rival NYSE Euronext are also interested.Asked about progress with the bid, Mr Greifeld said: “We are having productive discussions with the parties. We obviously see the strategic merits.”He said a combination of International Derivatives Clearing Group – Nasdaq’s fledgling interest rate swaps clearing house – and SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s 11-year old interest rate swaps clearing service, “would be a huge global competitor”.Nasdaq’s shares were down 74 cents, or 3 per cent, to $23.55 in afternoon trading in New York.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language.

772;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-22T20:27:59Z;Euro weakens as Greek bail-out rally fades;;Friday 21.15 BST. Hopes that a second eurozone deal to bail out Greece can cure the bloc’s sovereign debt contagion are showing signs of fading as traders endure another difficult day at the end of a painfully volatile week.The euro had been stable near two-week highs and European “peripheral” sovereign debt yields were falling sharply early on Friday as the EU package seemed to ease strains in the beleaguered sector.The yield on Spain’s 10-year note, for example, was down 12 basis points to 5.61 per cent and the Markit iTraxx SovX index, which tracks the cost of insuring western European sovereign debt against default, slid 30bp to 233bp, taking its decline over the past four days to nearly 25 per cent.But the single currency is now weaker by 0.4 per cent to the dollar at $1.4361 and Spanish 10-year yields are up 3bp to 5.76 per cent, while the SovX has pared its losses, as the ebullience that greeted the deal is replaced by a more sober analysis of the difficulties still facing heavily indebted eurozone nations.Investors also remain wary by a lack of resolution to that other fiscal farrago – the budget battle in Washington. Adding to the caution are some downbeat comments on Chinese demand from Caterpillar, which have raised fears over the strength of growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. Finally, an explosion in Oslo, Norway is compounding the nerves.The FTSE All-World equity index is up 0.4 per cent, helped by a 1.4 per cent surge for Asian stocks, which got their first chance to react to news of Thursday’s Brussels deal on eurozone debt.Banks soared and credit spreads in the region tightened as a less fraught financial environment was discounted. Better than expected results from Morgan Stanley on Thursday also helped the banks, while strong earnings from US technology companies buoyed their Asian peers.Tokyo added 1.2 per cent, Hong Kong jumped 2.1 per cent and Sydney rose 1 per cent. Companies with significant exposure to Europe prospered.But Wall Street is struggling to add to the previous session’s 1.4 per cent surge, as Caterpillar’s comments counteract better-than-expected results from McDonald’s and General Electric.The S&P 500, which at one stage looked like starting with a 0.5 per cent pop, ended just 0.1 per cent higher.The softer euro is providing a lift to the dollar index, which is up 0.3 per cent to 74.22. This in turn has crimped gains for many commodities, though they remain mostly in positive territory – a stoic performance given Caterpillar’s China doubts. Brent crude is higher by 0.9 per cent to $118.58 a barrel.Core bonds have rallied as the broader risk appetite has slowly deteriorated. German 10-year Bund yields, which hit 2.95 per cent at the European open, are now down 5bp to 2.83 per cent.US benchmark yields are off 5bp to 2.96 per cent, as traders await developments on the US budget negotiations. Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, met top officials from the Federal Reserve as he stepped up preparations for a possible default on US debt.Trading Post Comment.Eurozone deal done. Now it’s the turn of the US to deliver a sentiment-supporting, debt-tackling agreement.The discussions in Washington have been one of the factors behind recent sharp asset vacillations. The US faces a technical default if a fiscal agreement cannot be reached and the debt ceiling raised by August 2. Investors have been struggling to work out the impact of such an event while all the time speculating about what form the EU deal would take and also reacting to a heavy slate of corporate reporting.Yet the S&P 500 closed on Thursday night just 1.5 per cent below May’s cyclical high. Bulls will argue that this illustrates the market’s fundamental strength. Bears will contend that it means the market has already discounted a positive outcome for the Greek bail-out and the US debt ceiling talks, while also, arguably, pricing in a forecast-beating second-quarter earnings season.Meanwhile, those traders not rendered myopic by headline fever will have noted that the majority of economic data released during the week have been below expectations – Friday’s German Ifo business sentiment index for July is the latest disappointment – and that Greece’s debt burden remains unsustainable, according to most analysts. Gold bugs have noticed. The precious metal sits just $5 shy of its record high, up 1.1 per cent on the day at $1,605 an ounce.
773;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-21T11:25:37Z;Eurozone manufacturing output falls;;A closely-watched survey of eurozone economic activity dipped sharply in July, adding to the urgency for political leaders to find a solution to the region’s debt crisis at their summit on Thursday.Growth measured across the eurozone’s service and manufacturing sectors in the Markit purchasing managers’ index slowed much more than analysts had forecast, suggesting a rapid loss of momentum in the region’s economy.Eurozone manufacturing output declined for the first time since July 2009, according to the survey.The PMI cross-sector composite index fell to 50.8, its lowest level in almost two years, from 53.3 in June. Estimates by economists were for a much smaller drop to about 52.5.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said the growth in the eurozone recovery was the weakest since it first began in August 2009 after the financial crisis.“A renewed downturn in manufacturing export sales appears to have exacerbated a further deterioration in business and consumer confidence in domestic markets,” Mr Williamson said.Weakness was broad-based, Markit said. Surging growth in Germany and France during the first quarter had been replaced by “very modest rates of expansion” while other countries on the eurozone periphery had slipped deeper into contraction.In Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, the PMI data indicated a sharp slowdown in private sector output growth. Manufacturing new orders fell in July, ending a two-year period of growth and partly reflected the sharpest fall in new export orders since June 2009.The fall in Germany’s composite output index was the biggest since November 2008.The unexpectedly poor data sent share prices lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 0.8 per cent by mid-morning in London.Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said: “The combination of fiscal tightening, high commodity prices, higher interest rates, slowing foreign demand and, last but not least, heightened sovereign debt tensions is clearly acting as a major brake on the recovery.“The rate at which the recovery has lost momentum is alarming. The subdued PMI data will pile pressure on eurozone leaders to come up with a comprehensive solution to the sovereign debt crisis.”Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said the sharp decline in German PMI data was “a bit of a worry…the European economy is losing momentum at a time when the resolution to the crisis is going to be heavily dependent on a strong Germany.”
774;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-19T17:56:25Z;Corporate debt faces murky six months;;A leading UK investment banker recently quipped to a rival that financial markets are now so choppy and unpredictable that he had told his fixed income division to limit the bets of any trader who expressed strong opinions about the future direction of markets.It is uncertain whether the bank chief was entirely serious, but the past half year’s corporate bond rally has clearly come to an abrupt end. And bankers say the outlook for the second half of 2011 is becoming increasingly murky – particularly in Europe, where Greece’s debt crisis continues to periodically spook investors.“This is an increasingly difficult time for corporate bonds,” says Simon Ballard, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Investors still want yield, but there’s this overarching fear that we’re about to fall down the abyss.”The stakes are high. Access to corporate credit will be a vital factor for Europe’s recovery, which, outside of Germany and a smattering of other northern states, has been sluggish. With bank lending still languishing, bonds have become increasingly important. If weaker companies find themselves priced or shut out from debt markets, some could default, exacerbate risk aversion further or drag on growth.Nervousness is clearly on the rise. The iTraxx Europe Crossover index, which follows high-yield corporate debt, has see-sawed from 430 basis points at the start of the year to a low of about 350bp in early May, before climbing to an eight-month high of over 470bp earlier this week, according to Markit, a data provider.Meanwhile, the Markit iTraxx Europe index, which tracks less volatile investment-grade debt, fell from about 110bp at the start of 2011 to a low of 94bp in early April, before jumping to a one-year high of 126bp this week.The recent turbulence has caused issuance to shrivel. According to Thomson Reuters, the volume of European corporate bonds sold fell from $40bn in May, to $18.5bn in June and $12.3bn so far this month. Almost all of this is for investment-grade paper.Indeed, bankers are almost united in expecting central bank interest rates to stay low and bond yields for top-rated companies to also remain low, given the exceptionally high levels of cash reserves of higher-rated companies.But they differ in their outlook for riskier corporate bonds and where spreads – the differences between benchmark interest rates and borrowing costs – are heading.Michael Ridley, global head of fixed income syndicate at JPMorgan, predicts that investment grade credit spreads are likely to be tighter by the end of the year, but expects high yield bond spreads to be wider.“With slowing economic growth I think defaults and restructurings are likely to start to rise again for lower rated borrowers, while investment grade companies have exceptionally strong balance sheets at the moment,” he says.The strength of the high-yield rally earlier this year led some to warn that credit standards were becoming too loose amid an indiscriminate hunt for yield. For example, some bankers were surprised that Gala Coral, the UK casino operator that was taken over in a debt-for-equity swap last year, was able to issue £625m of seven and eight-year bonds in May.The seven-year £350m of senior secured bonds carried a coupon of 8.875 per cent and the £275m of eight year senior notes paid 11.5 per cent. The yields have since shot up to 10.9 per cent and 15.1 per cent respectively.In fact, all corporate credit spreads have widened significantly of late, and there have been no significant high-yield bond sales for several weeks now. Some observers are concerned that there is more pain to come.Although default rates remain very low – and rating agencies predict that they will stay subdued - the European economy could splutter as government austerity programmes begin to bite. This could in turn weigh on corporate earnings.“Defaults are a lagging indicator,” Mr Ballard points out. “You won’t see the rating agencies flag it until six months after the fact. Default rates certainly don’t look likely to go any lower.”Yet other bankers argue that the European high-yield market is still fundamentally strong, and that investors are being compensated sufficiently for any rise in corporate defaults that may occur. They predict the market will reopen in September.Many fund managers agree, and after a sharp surge of withdrawals from high-yield bond funds in June, most have seen money return to their coffers this month.Moody’s late last week predicted that Europe will still see a record volume of high-yield bond issuance this year, beating last year’s $65bn despite the current market shut-down.Given that $58bn has already been sold in this year, that seems a safe bet, but bankers warn that much will depend on the denouement of Greece’s debt crisis. Although few expect a “hard restructuring” this year, most predict occasional bouts of volatility where the debt markets effectively shut down, only to be followed by sharp relief rallies.Bankers advise company treasurers and financial officers to be prepared for these intermittent relief rallies, which offer windows for issuance that companies will have to seize.These sporadic windows are likely to be the main story for the second half of the year, but “the markets are difficult to read,” warns Brendan Moran, global co-head of corporate origination at Société Générale. “We’re in uncharted waters”.
775;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-14T20:09:04Z;LCH hires new CIO amid shake-up;;LCH.Clearnet has hired a former Bank of America Merrill Lynch banker, Tom Zschach, as group chief information officer in one of the first signs that the clearing house’s new chief executive, Ian Axe, is making changes to his top team.Mr Zschach, who replaces Martin Taylor, will be responsible for overseeing LCH.Clearnet’s technology infrastructure, “ensuring that the robustness and resilience of the company’s industry-leading clearing solutions is preserved”, the clearer said.LCH.Clearnet is facing unprecedented uncertainty as Mr Axe pushes through a radical restructuring of the group, the only remaining large user-owned clearing house in Europe.At the same time it has been presented with a joint bid from Markit and NYSE Euronext, and one from Nasdaq OMX, which is interested in a minority stake.Technology has been a running issue at LCH.Clearnet, the products of the merger in 2003 between Clearnet SA of Paris and the London Clearing House.The French and British markets that are cleared by Clearnet and LCH respectively each use different settlement netting practices. That is one reason why it has been hard to mesh the two technology platforms – one the merger’s initial ambitions.At Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Mr Zschach was managing director and co-head of global rates and currencies technology infrastructure.Before that he held several senior technology roles at investment banks, supporting fixed income, equities and derivatives businesses, including Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch and the former Lehman Brothers.Ian Axe, chief executive, LCH.Clearnet, said: “Tom’s wealth of experience as a technology leader, coupled with his deep industry knowledge, will enable us to sustain the highest possible performance to meet the needs of our customers across the globe.“With regulators and legislators looking to introduce more products to clearing, providing a safe, reliable and robust technology infrastructure is crucial.”
776;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-14T18:21:46Z;High-yield issuance to hit record this year, says Moody’s;;Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has predicted Europe will see a record volume of high-yield bond issuance this year, despite the worsening sovereign debt crisis on the continent’s periphery.Mounting concern that the European debt crisis is spreading to larger southern economies such as Italy and Spain has rattled corporate debt markets this month and brought issuance of fresh high-yield bonds to a juddering halt.The Markit iTraxx Europe Crossover index, which reflects the cost of insuring against the default of a basket of high-yield bonds, climbed to a seven-month high of more than 450 basis points this week, up from about 350bp at the beginning of May.Over roughly the same period, investors pulled out a net $8.3bn from high-yield bond funds, estimates EPFR Global, a data provider.However, while the market remains “susceptible to shocks”, companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa sold $58bn of high-yielding bonds in the first six months of the year, and should still surpass last year’s record $65bn, Moody’s said in a report.“Issuance has been high as the high-yield market has been the main solution for refinancing needs ahead of a significant maturity wall,” the credit rating agency said. “We expect the fundamental shift from bank to bond debt to continue.”Bankers are concerned that the European high-yield market has entered an extended summer hiatus due to turbulent markets, but many remain convinced that issuance will resume and yields recover in August-September.“Spreads and yields are all over the place. But high yield has been the place to be this year,” said Viswas Raghavan, head of international capital markets at JPMorgan in London.“Investor quest for yield is still strong, and corporate balance sheets are largely robust, even non-investment grade ones.“Markets are a bit nervous now, but I have no doubt that at the slightest sign of stability, they will come right back.”Indeed, there have been tentative signs of the market stabilising.EPFR estimates that high-yield bond funds snapped their “short, sharp losing run” in the first week of July, and the Crossover index has slipped in the past two days.Moreover, Europe’s default rate remains low, at 1.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2011, and Moody’s expects the “low default environment to continue over the rest of the year”.But bankers concede that much will depend on better news from Europe’s indebted southern rim.
777;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-14T10:56:03Z;Italy pays record rates at bond sale;;Italy raised nearly €3bn from bond sales on Thursday but was forced to pay record interest rates in a make-or-break government debt auction that was seen as a key test of investor confidence in the eurozone.The auction was seen as crucial for the eurozone after a turbulent week that has sucked Italy into the euro debt crisis amid concerns about its high levels of debt.The sale came as Italy’s parliament prepares to vote over the next two days on a three-year €40bn austerity package to eliminate the budget deficit by 2014. Opposition parties have said they will co-operate with Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, to ensure that the package of cuts passes through parliament in record speed with a final vote in the lower house on Friday. The upper house or Senate will vote later on Thursday on proposals.The €1.72bn sale of 15-year bonds was nearly 1.5 times subscribed indicating there was still appetite for the country’s debt, but the 5.9 per cent yield was the highest on record. The €1.25bn five-year bond sale was nearly two times subscribed, while the yield, at 4.93 per cent, was the highest paid at auction in three years.In the benchmark five-year maturity Rome had to pay yields of 4.93 per cent versus 3.9 per cent on June 14, a sharp increase in premiums that highlights the dangers for the eurozone’s biggest government bond market.The fact Rome had to pay high premiums to attract demand is a sign that the eurozone woes are far from over.Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit, the data provider, said: “The bid-to-cover ratios were relatively strong, but the yields were very high.”“The market seems to be focusing on the latter. The support of domestic accounts will also be crucial throughout the day. Italy’s spreads are now wider than pre-auction levels.”Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities, said: “While it is good news that they got it done, the rising trend in yields is of some concern. Italy is not so much too big to fail as too big to bail, so it is very important that yields stabilise.”Following the auction yields on the benchmark 10-year Italian government bond rose 7.5 basis points to 5.64 per cent. The Italian credit default swaps rose 8 basis points to 290bps, meaning the cost of insuring $10m of debt a year for five years rose $8,000. In the equity market, Italy’s FTSE MIB index, which had been recovering earlier in the session, fell 1.6 per cent to 18,551.44.Italy has to refinance hundreds of billions of bonds over the next three years and higher borrowing costs or yields will put extra strains on its already sluggish economy.
778;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-13T23:09:53Z;Advertisers’ confidence at low point;;Confidence among advertisers has fallen close to levels last plumbed during the recession, according to the latest IPA/BDO Bellwether survey.In the second quarter, more companies – about a fifth of those surveyed – said they were trimming their advertising budgets than were increasing them.The survey, conducted by Markit Economics, found that 28 per cent of marketing chiefs were feeling less confident about their own companies’ trading performance, while 31 per cent were more optimistic – the lowest net level of optimism in more than two years.“The year may not be going as well in sales and profitability as [companies] expected, so they are gradually edging their budgets down,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “We are not signalling falling spend for the year, but it’s not as upbeat as it was.”Traditional media buying and sales promotions, such as discounts and in-store offers, saw the greatest decline, while spending on internet advertising and search is still generally increasing, albeit at a slower rate than earlier in the year.Direct marketing remains the strongest form of communication, as it is seen as allowing for more flexibility in spending than a splashy TV ad and its return on investment can be more easily determined.As advertising spending often closely tracks economic confidence, the survey suggests the UK’s financial climate remains weak, Mr Williamson added.“Our view is that the economy may have slipped back into a slight contraction in the second quarter. This confirms that picture of very little growth in the economy. We expect marketers to remain cautious over the rest of the year,” he said.Marketers told the Bellwether survey that reduced sales forecasts, cash flow pressures, spending cuts and declining new business were among the reasons for cutting budgets.Hamish Pringle, director-general of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said that marketers’ outlook was “pretty poor”.“The confidence of marketers in their own company is worrying. It’s not in recessionary mode, but coming alarmingly close to that line,” Mr Pringle said. “We are definitely not out of the woods. The economy is going sideways and the bellwether is doing the same.”However, he added that he was pleasantly surprised that as many marketers were maintaining their spending.On Wednesday, ZenithOptimedia, Publicis’ media agency, trimmed its growth forecast for advertising spending in western Europe this year to 3.3 per cent. Global media investment is expected to grow 4.1 per cent in 2011 to $471m (£295m), back to the pre-recession peak of 2008.
779;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-13T13:37:56Z;Icap to expand in spite of reform delays;;Icap, the world’s largest interdealer broker, confirmed on Wednesday was committed to pushing on with the expansion of new electronic trading platforms, even amid delays to the introduction of far-reaching financial markets reform.In a trading update for the three months to June 30, the broker said it had seen further growth in use of the electronic platforms it has spent heavily on to trade swaps, derivatives and fixed income products.Michael Spencer, chief executive, is aiming to take advantage of a drive by regulators in Washington and Brussels to make the vast but opaque derivatives market more transparent and efficient. Authorities want to push more bilaterally-agreed trades through electronic platforms and clearing houses.Broker-dealers have been pressing ahead with their plans even though the rules have yet to be finalised and have been pushed back to allow regulators time to write the rules.Implementation of the Dodd-Frank act has been put back about six months to the end of the year while European has postponed finalisation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which contains similar provisions on clearing of OTC derivatives to Dodd-Frank.However, Mr Spencer ruled out making acquisitions or branching out into new areas. “We will continue to concentrate on growing our business organically, work to reduce our costs and push forward with our drive to expand our successful electronic interest rate swap platform into other currencies,” said Mr Spencer.Among the assets eyed by the market is LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, which has received offers from the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and a joint bid from NYSE Euronext and Markit, the data provider. Icap made a bid for the business in 2009.Total revenues in the three month period dipped 4 per cent compared to last year as higher numbers of public holidays over the period restricted trading volumes. Comparative figures were also affected by increased market activity surrounding the ‘flash crash’ of May 2010. However Icap added that June saw an uptick in market volumes. The group remained comfortable with analysts’ forecasts for full-year earnings to be in the range of £366m to £402m as it expected to benefit from market uncertainty over central banks’ inflation and interest rate strategies.Icap said volumes on its EBS and BrokerTec electronic platforms for fixed income products had risen 10 per cent year-on-year to $878bn. Meanwhile it said more than 6,800 trades valued at over €510bn have been traded on iSwap, the new electronic interest rate swaps platform for over-the-counter derivatives which launched last September.It added that its post-trade services business is “back to levels we would expect” after a slow start to the 2010-11 trading year. Shares in Icap were down 1 per cent at 476p in lunchtime trade in London.
780;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-12T15:32:41Z;Europe’s corporate bonds stalled by Greek debt fear;Plans to issue bonds are postponed;"European debt markets have virtually shut for corporate bond sales due to mounting concerns that Greece’s debt crisis is starting to affect larger southern European countries such as Spain and Italy.Bonds sold last week by Enel, Italy’s largest power operator, and Fiat, were the last significant debt issues in Europe before a downgrade of Portugal’s credit rating, poor non-farm payroll statistics from the US and fears over the debt crisis killed off a brief rally in bond markets.“The credit markets are feeling awful, and for the moment have pretty much shut down,” said Marco Baldini, head of European corporate syndicate at Barclays Capital. “There was a big pipeline of potential new issues, but for now no one is going to come to the market in this sort of environment.”German bank Bayern LG and French toll road operator Autoroutes du Sud both had to delay plans to issue bonds late last week. Bankers say even the most solid companies in Europe are now likely to shelve planned debt sales, which could mean an extended hiatus given the looming summer holidays on the continent.“For nimble issuers there will be windows for issuance, but they may not be open for long,” warned Peter Charles, head of European fixed-income syndicate at Citigroup. The Markit iTraxx Europe index
that tracks investment grade corporate debt climbed to 121 basis points, and the Crossover index of high-yield debt has risen to 457bp, the widest since November last year.On July 5 Enel raised €1.75bn through the sale of bonds due in six and 10 years, and Fiat sold €1.5bn of three- and seven-year bonds. Each issue has struggled since. “The timing was perfect but, like many other recent deals, they haven’t performed well in the aftermarket given the headline newsflow,” said Brendon Moran, global co-head of corporate origination at Société Générale."
781;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-07-11T18:22:24Z;Italy and the US;Markets’ perception of riskiness does not make sense;On one side of the Atlantic, markets are making the eurozone riskier than it needs to be. On the other, they are treating the US as less risky than it is.Italy is the latest European pressure-point. The country’s credit default spread, measured by Markit, has risen by 92 per cent since the beginning of May. At 281 basis points on Monday morning, it was catching up with Spain (340 bps). Germany is at 45 bps.That development makes little sense. For at least a decade, politicians of both left and right have yielded to the technocrats at the Italian Treasury. That should continue, with or without strong growth. The country’s debt level is much too high at 119 per cent of gross domestic product, but it is set to stabilise next year.Bears worry about Italy’s banks– but there is little evidence of an impending crisis in a nation that did not have a property bubble. Investors’ most reasonable fear is of their own irrationality. A sovereign debt buyers’ strike would create a funding crisis, however much austerity the government introduces.Meanwhile, the US CDS spread is only 51 bps. Admittedly, this is an odd instrument, since few sellers could be relied on to pay out if the US really went belly-up. But the low level, which has risen only 18 per cent since early May, hardly reflects the increased risk of an actual default, the fiscal deficit of 9.3 per cent of GDP, or bipartisan fiscal indiscipline. If Italy was as messed up as the US, its CDS spread would probably look more like Portugal’s (1090 bps).Why the different treatment? Investors can remember the pre-euro world and can easily imagine eurozone defaults and break-up. But they cannot really conceive of a financial world not built on US debt. That lack of imagination is dangerous. Market pressure has helped eurozone nations, including Italy, to act responsibly. Investors’ insouciance is allowing the US to flirt with disaster.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
782;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-06-29T17:36:24Z;European insurers see sharp rise in debt protection cost;Aegon, Axa and Generali under pressure in credit derivatives market;Leading European insurers Aegon, Axa and Generali are coming under pressure in credit derivatives markets alongside banks that are known to have much higher exposure to Greek sovereign debt, such as BNP, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale.The cost of protecting the debt of many European financial companies has risen sharply in recent weeks as the political situation in Greece has deteriorated and the hunt for a solution to stave off a sovereign default has become more acute.French banks are leading a private sector proposal to roll over some Greek debt into 30-year bonds, which would allow the financial sector to take some money out of Greece and not take a loss on the remaining amount that the country cannot immediately pay back.Since the most recent low point on April 11, the three insurers have seen the cost of protection on their senior debt rise sharply.Aegon’s five-year credit default premium has risen 43 basis points to 190bp, Axa’s is up 41bp to 170bp and Generali is 60bp higher at 184bp.This compares with a rise of 33bp to 117bp for BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole’s 33bp increase to 142bp and SocGen’s 33bp rise to 140bp, all according to data from Markit.BNP has been estimated to have the highest direct exposure to Greek government debt with about €5bn in bonds, according to Morgan Stanley. The insurers’ exposure is nowhere near this level, with Aegon holding just €3m, Axa €300m and Generali €500m, according to JPMorgan.Duncan Russell, analyst at JPMorgan, notes that more than 95 per cent of insurers’ exposure to Greek debt is in bonds of more than five years’ duration – in contrast to banks, which are more exposed to near-term maturities – and so most of the limited holdings they do have would not be touched by the rollover proposals.Other analysts said the pricing of insurers’ credit default swaps looked like an over-reaction, probably linked to insurers’ sensitivity to bond markets in general. Anthony Silverman at S&P Equity Research said the market might be looking forward to some of the insurers’ greater exposure to Italian and Spanish bonds.Allianz, Axa and Generali all hold billions in Italian bonds, while the first two have sizeable exposures to Spanish bonds. However, Suki Mann, credit analyst at SG CIB, said credit markets might also be worried about the knock-on effects of any Greek default for the European economy and equity markets more broadly.“If we have a Greek default, we can quickly quantify the bank exposures, but what will be the hit to equity markets?,” said Mr Mann. “If equities come under significant pressure, that could cause real pain to the big insurers.”

784;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-06-23T10:52:09Z;Sharp slowdown in eurozone growth;;Eurozone economic growth has seen a sharp loss of momentum, with even Germany’s powerful industrial sector unable to escape the headwinds damping activity around the world.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 17-country eurozone dropped markedly in June, indicating private sector activity had expanded at the slowest pace in almost two years. The deceleration was especially strong in manufacturing. Economic activity outside Germany and France contracted for the first time since late 2009.The slowdown will add to the region’s difficulties as it grapples with the debt crisis engulfing Greece – but seems unlikely to stop the European Central Bank pressing ahead with another interest rate rise next month to head off inflation dangers.Led by rapid growth in Germany, the eurozone economy saw a robust expansion in the first three months of this year, when gross domestic product was 0.8 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. But growth since then has been hit by higher oil prices, worries about global economic prospects, fiscal tightening in many countries and the supply chain disruption caused by Japan’s earthquake.“The euro area’s growth surge has lost momentum at a worrying rate in the past two months,” said Chris Williamson, chief at economist at Markit, which produces the purchasing managers’ indices. The indices indicated GDP had still expanded by about 0.6 per cent in the second quarter but June’s readings were consistent with a quarterly growth rate of just 0.4 per cent.The “composite” eurozone index, covering manufacturing and service sectors, fell more than expected from 55.8 in May to 53.6 in June, the lowest for 20 months. A figure above 50 points to an expansion in activity.France saw a slowdown in both manufacturing and service industries. One bright spot in the latest figures was a pick-up in German service sector activity – which could have reflected the rising importance of domestic demand as a growth motor in Europe’s largest economy. Germany’s “composite” index rose from 57.1 in May to 57.3 in June but the German index for manufacturing dropped sharply, from 57.7 to 54.9, the lowest for 17 months.Germany and France continued to outpace the rest of the eurozone, Markit reported, highlighting the divergence between the eurozone “core” and the crisis-hit “periphery” countries – Greece, Portugal and Ireland.That has complicated the task of the ECB as it calibrates monetary policy for the region. But the Frankfurt-based institution looks at overall eurozone prospects and the latest data are unlikely to change its view that eurozone growth will continue, albeit at a slower pace.Jean-Claude Trichet, president, has indicated that the ECB will raise its main interest rate by another quarter percentage point to 1.5 per cent at its July governing board meeting.Eurozone inflation, at 2.7 per cent in May is above the ECB’s objective of an annual rate “below but close” to 2 per cent – although the purchasing managers’ indices suggested price pressures had also eased in June. But Ken Wattret, European economist at BNP Paribas, said financial markets would see the latest purchasing managers’ indices “as a further reason to question how far the tightening can go beyond the next policy meeting”.
785;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;A temperature check on global growth;;Most of the key data on global economic activity for the month of May have been published in the past few days, and they have certainly added to concerns about the strength of the recovery from the Great Recession. The speed and extent of the decline in the manufacturing growth has been unusually severe, especially in the US, where the ISM business survey suffered its ninth largest monthly decline in its entire history, which extends back to 1948. In this earlier blog, I argued that policy makers in the US might be “out of ammo” if the economy headed towards a double dip recession. But I also said that that was not yet the most likely out-turn. Here is my take on what recent data in the US and elsewhere are telling us about the recovery.As usual, the most important “real time” activity data come from the monthly business surveys published by Markit and the ISM. On a global basis, the manufacturing PMI fell by 2 points in May, and it has now dropped by over 5 points since it hit its peak in February. However, much of this precipitous decline has been due to the impact of the Japanese earthquake, both in Japan itself and in other countries via disruptions in supply chains. The good news is that the worst of these effects are now in the past. Japanese industrial output, which fell by 15.5 per cent in March alone, is now slated to increase by 8 per cent in both May and June, and this will definitely provide a significant fillip to the global industrial sector.However, even without the hit from Japan, the global manufacturing sector has been in rapid retreat in recent months. The first graph shows the business survey readings for manufacturing in the main economies, ex Japan. The recent collapse in activity, especially in May, has been far more abrupt than the temporary decline which occurred a year ago. Admittedly, part of this decline has probably been due to supply chain disruptions, notably in the auto sector. But there is no doubt that firms have also deliberately been cutting back on their inventory holdings, which had risen more rapidly than they had intended in Q1. There is no firm evidence as yet that this bout of inventory shedding has ended.Fortunately, the service sector of the global economy has not deteriorated quite as much as the manufacturing sector. This was looking fairly ominous a month ago, when the US non manufacturing ISM survey suddenly imploded by over 4 points, but it seems that part of this drop may have been due to faulty seasonal adjustment, and the index rebounded by almost 2 points when the May data appeared on Friday. This has led to a small but significant rise in the global index (again, ex Japan) in May, as the second graph shows. This was enough to settle some nerves, after the US employment data for the same month had triggered widespread disappointment.If we add together all of the business survey evidence for May, we get a picture of a global economy which is probably continuing to expand, but not at a very rapid rate. The third graph shows the aggregate readings for all business surveys, this time including Japan, which is probably the single best real time indicator for state of the world economy right now. (I accept, incidentally, that business surveys can differ from the eventual “truth”, as determined by official GDP statistics, but the latter only appear with very long lags.) The normal statistical relationship between the survey results and GDP would suggest that the growth rate of G7 GDP in Q2 is running at an annualised rate of about 1.7 per cent, which is definitely below trend. If we take Japan out of these figures, then we derive a growth rate for the rest of the developed world of somewhere around 2-2.5 per cent, which is at, or a fraction below trend.In summary, then, the decline in business surveys has been greater than occurred in the spring of last year, when the world economic recovery hit a temporary pot-hole. This is especially true in the manufacturing sector, which has continued to nosedive in the month of May, while the services sector seems to have stabilised. The good news is that, although the survey results have fallen sharply from the extremely healthy readings which were recorded in February, they have not yet fallen to anywhere near the levels which would trigger serious concerns about a double dip recession.Clearly, markets are going to be extremely sensitive to what happens next. If manufacturing surveys start to advance as the Japan impact begins to reverse, then worries about a double dip will start to fade. If the downward momentum continues in manufacturing, and starts to undermine the strength of services, concerns about the recovery will mount rapidly.I do not expect that to happen, provided that oil prices stay at or below current levels. But it is worth emphasising that even if the surveys do start to recover in the near future, they certainly do not suggest that the world economy is enjoying the kind of strong, healthy recovery which would be enough to get unemployment down in the developed world. At best, we seem to be locked into a sub par recovery from a very deep recession.
786;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-06-01T10:43:31Z;Indian manufacturing growth slows;;The pace of growth in India’s manufacturing sector moderated slightly in May, adding to indications that the economy is slowing after a series of interest rate increases designed to curb inflation.The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, which provides a monthly snapshot of the sector, eased to 57.5 from 58 in the previous month. A figure above 50 indicates expansion and a lower figure indicates contraction.The figure indicates that manufacturing continued to expand rapidly during the month, but may be beginning to respond to tighter monetary conditions in the wake of nine successive rises in the benchmark interest rate, to 7.35 per cent.Economists said the PMI numbers, released on Wednesday, reinforced the impression of a gradual slowdown from a 14 month high in April.However, HSBC said momentum remained strong, with evidence of a rising backlog of work and lengthening delivery times. The May figure was the second highest since November.Leif Eskesen, HSBC chief economist for India and south-east Asia, said “The numbers confirm that growth is holding up well, and that inflation pressures are still firmly in place, which leaves the door open for continued monetary tightening”.The government said on Tuesday that Asia’s third-largest economy grew by a weaker than expected 7.8 per cent in the fourth quarter to March, its slowest growth since 2009. Growth for the full year was 8.5 per cent, just below the official forecast.Headline inflation fell 8.7 per cent in April, down from 9 per cent in March, but remains at nearly double the central bank’s medium-term target of 4.5 per cent, and is forecast by most economists to stay above 8 per cent for much of the year.PMI results for Taiwan and South Korea, also released on Wednesday, showed a slight weakening of the pace of growth but confirmed that manufacturing remains healthy in both countries.The Taiwan index slipped to a five-month low of 54.9 from 58.2 in April, but the expansion remained above the long-run trend rate. The South Korea index eased to a six-month low of 51.2 from 51.7, indicating modest growth.The Japan Manufacturing PMI, compiled by the Japan Materials Management Association and Markit, the financial information group, strengthened to 51.3 from 45.7 in April signalling one of the largest month on month improvements since the index was first compiled in 2001.Alex Hamilton, a Markit economist, said the data, released on Tuesday, pointed to “a welcome rebound in Japanese manufacturing activity in May, as a sharp easing in supply chain pressures enabled firms to restart production lines following the disruption caused by March’s earthquake and tsunami.”
787;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-31T16:19:04Z;China bulls lassoed by growth concerns;;Only two months ago, Chinese stocks were on a roll. The Shanghai Composite was Asia’s best-performing equity index for the year to date and almost every broker in the region was forecasting further gains.But for the bulls, things have not gone to plan.Since peaking in mid-April, Shanghai stocks have fallen by more than 10 per cent as investors have become increasingly worried about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, even as inflation remains stubbornly high.“The major risk to the equity market has started to shift from concern about inflation and the fight against housing prices, to concerns about growth,” says Frank Yao, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Neuberger Berman Asia.Chinese manufacturing production growth fell to a 10-month low in May, according to a survey by HSBC and Markit, sparking concerns that the second-biggest economy is suddenly slowing.A more comprehensive version of the purchasing managers’ survey, due to be published by the Chinese government on Wednesday, is expected to provide further evidence of the slowdown.Most economists, nonetheless, expect a “soft landing” for the Chinese economy, forecasting real gross domestic product growth of about 9 per cent in 2011, down from 10.3 per cent last year.Not everyone is so confident.Diana Choyleva, China strategist at Lombard Street Research, believes growth will need to fall substantially below trend in 2011 if the government is to stand a chance of bringing inflation under control.As a consequence, says Ms Choyleva, Chinese companies will see profits “hammered” – a “double whammy” from weaker revenue growth and continued rising unit labour costs.On average, Chinese companies reported strong sales growth in the first quarter of 2011 – good news for the bulls.But bears noted that rising wages and commodity prices ate into profit margins.Chinese machinery manufacturers suffered a sudden sales plunge in April, well below normal seasonal fluctuations, according to newspaper reports that have caused shares in the sector to tumble.Investors are braced for the next batch of Chinese inflation data, due to be released in mid-June.The consumer price index edged down from a 32-month high of 5.4 per cent in March to 5.3 per cent in April, much higher than the government target of 4 per cent.“It seems inflation pressure is here to stay, even in the second half,” Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Robeco, says.Like the other Bric economies, China is fighting to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in its economy, eroding living standards and leading to social unrest.Rising prices, especially for food, trigger riots and have been identified as a factor in the Jasmine Revolution that toppled dictatorships in the Middle East.To try to contain prices, Beijing has raised benchmark interest rates four times and increased bank reserve requirements eight times since October 2010.Market participants expect one or two more rate rises by the year’s end.As well as increasing the cost of credit, Beijing has also lowered the overall amount banks are allowed to lend.Growth in the M2 money supply has fallen from a peak of nearly 30 per cent in 2009 to an average of 16 per cent in the last two months.Chinese companies are feeling the effects, especially smaller companies, which are unable to obtain credit from commercial banks orientated towards providing cheap loans to large state-owned enterprises.“The typical smaller borrower will turn instead to the shadow banking system of trust companies and underground banks,” Mark Williams at Capital Economics says.“The rates charged here are far higher than those on bank loans.”A one-year loan from a commercial bank costs only 7.4 per cent – an attractive rate in an economy growing at more than twice that rate in nominal terms.However, smaller companies borrowing from trust companies – a type of investment vehicle outside the Chinese banking system – have to pay as much as 20 per cent for a one-year loan, according to Mr Williams.Companies borrowing from underground banks must pay even higher rates.The credit squeeze is making its presence felt in the equity markets.The Shenzhen Composite, which tracks companies that tend to be much smaller than those listed in Shanghai, has fallen sharply this year.While Shanghai is down 2.3 per cent since January, Shenzhen is down 13.9 per cent.The ChiNext Composite, an index of start-up companies, is down 25.5 per cent.The People’s Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist party, published an article last week proclaiming that the country’s stock market has reached a bottom: stocks are as cheap as they are going to get.The politicians may have a point.On a market cap weighted basis, Shanghai stocks are trading at about a 12 times forward p/e ratio – a 30 per cent discount to their long-term average, Macquarie estimates.By that measure, the only way is up – as long as Chinese companies make their earnings targets for 2011.
788;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-28T11:17:19Z;Exchanges fight for LCH.Clearnet;;Three of the world’s largest exchanges have entered a battle for control of LCH.Clearnet as a wave of exchange consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house, three people familiar with the matter said.The move for the London-based clearer, between NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, is a sign that the world’s bourses are desperate to snap up businesses that allow them to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system.All three bourses tabled bids ranging from €350m ($500m) to €1bn at a board meeting held two weeks ago.LCH.Clearnet confirmed on Saturday that it had “received various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation with LCH.Clearnet”.“LCH.Clearnet’s considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction,” the London-based clearer said.The LSE has offered €21 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn, one person said. However, the LSE on Saturday distanced itself from any move, saying it noted “recent press speculation” regarding it and LCH.Clearnet and “confirms that it is not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.Clearing houses have long been part of the unglamorous back office processes that ensure deals are completed in shares, binds and derivatives and bonds.But they have shot to prominence amid financial reforms designed to clean up the financial system after the 2008 financial crisis. Such reforms, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US and similar European proposals will force over-the-counter derivatives on to exchanges and through clearing houses to make such markets more transparent.A clearing house stands between buyers and sellers, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed if one party defaults. The London clearer was formed from a merger in 2003 between the London Clearing House and Clearnet, clearer for the Paris Bourse.All three bidders want control of LCH.Clearnet since it operates, with big banks, a clearing service for OTC interest rate swaps called SwapClear, which recently pushed into the US to compete with CME Group, the US exchange, in derivatives clearing. Interest rate swaps are the largest part of the OTC derivatives market and are set for growth, market experts believe, as they are pushed on to electronic platforms by the reforms.One person said LCH.Clearnet had not yet responded formally to any of the offers. “It’s very fluid and nobody knows. The board’s gone away to think about it,” the person said.The board is made up of 21 people, including Ian Axe, former chief operating officer for Barclays Capital, who became chief executive in February. At the time of his appointment, he said: “As the market leader in OTC clearing and with expertise in a broader range of assets than any other clearing house globally, LCH.Clearnet is well placed to benefit from the worldwide drive to reduce systemic risk.”Ownership of a clearing house boosts revenues at exchange but also gives them quasi-monopoly control of derivatives trading and clearing and locking out competitors in so-called “vertical silos”. Derivatives are growing faster than equities, with certain benchmark futures contracts – a popular type of derivative – among the fastest-growing of them.For the LSE, one of the few exchanges not to own a domestic clearer, the move was described by a second person as “a survival move” to get deeper into clearing as rivals Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext pursue a $9.4bn merger. That deal, if consummated, would bring together the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with NYSE Euronext’s London-based Liffe futures exchange, with clearing being concentrated at Eurex Clearing, owned by the Börse.The LSE is next month set to launch an assault against Eurex and Liffe in futures, with clearing to be carried out at LCH.Clearnet and an Italian clearing house operated by the LSE through its ownership of Borsa Italiana, Italy’s main exchange operator.Shares in the LSE soared more than 10 per cent this week to their highest level in three years amid speculation that Nasdaq might make its second attempt since 2006 to buy the British bourse.The LSE is in the midst of a separate battle against a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds as it pursues an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of the Tornonto Stock Exchange and Montreal derivatives exchange.Nasdaq OMX has tabled a bid that would value LCH.Clearnet at €350m, the first person said. “The offer’s a bit low and complicated,” that person said, referring to how Nasdaq has proposed to include in its cash offer the existing clearing businesses it owns in Europe.Nasdaq’s talks with LCH.Clearnet started about six weeks ago, just before Bob Greifeld, the exchange’s chief executive, was forced to abandon an audacious joint bid with InterContinentalExchange for NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, after it failed an antitrust test. “It gets Nasdaq more firmly into Europe,” one person close to the Nasdaq bid said. “But this is not a deal that needs to be done.”Nasdaq declined to comment.Mr Greifeld said last week at Nasdaq’s shareholder meeting that the company would be “maniacally focused on executing our business plan and at the same time ensuring that we are strategically positioned for emerging growth opportunities”.A move for LCH.Clearnet would secure Mr Greifeld a major presence in clearing of cash equities and OTC derivatives in London, at a time when an existing US OTC derivatives clearer he controls, International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), has failed to gain traction in interest rate swaps. It has secured only a few members of the clearing house, meaning it has too few members that would be able to bring it OTC derivatives trades from customers using them that need them to be cleared.LCH.Clearnet already has a thriving interest rate swaps business at SwapClear in London and recently launched such a service aimed at non-banks users of interest rate swaps in the US, which competes with a service also recently launched by CME Group.NYSE Euronext has teamed up with Markit, a financial information company specialising in OTC derivatives, in a €10 a share bid that values LCH.Clearnet at under €500m, the first person said.Markit is involved in the pricing and dissemination of data in the OTC derivatives markets, which are also a focus of regulators as they insist that such data be more formally organised, electronically, to provide pricing more transparently to markets and to help build an “audit trail” of trades that can be easily seen by regulators.However, a takeover of LCH.Clearnet would be complicated because it has 98 shareholders, including NYSE Euronext with 9 per cent and the London Metal Exchange with 8 per cent.In addition, the banks involved in the OTC derivatives clearing business that falls under the SwapClear service must give their consent to any change in control that affects SwapClear. Many of those banks – including JPMorgan and Barclays Capital – are on the LCH.Clearnet board.The banks share revenues from the SwapClear service with LCH.Clearnet as part of a complex arrangement. They are seen as unlikely to be in favour of selling to an exchange unless on terms that secure their ongoing involvement in OTC derivatives clearing.This is the third time since 2008 that LCH.Clearnet has been faced a possible change in ownership or takeover bid. The first came that year when The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US clearing and settlement group, agreed a merger with LCH.Clearnet, to create a transatlantic clearing group.That deal collapsed after the emergence of a consortium of 11 banks – many of the same ones affiliated with the SwapClear service – joined forces with Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, in 2009 for a €11 a share cash offer valuing the UK clearer at about €830m.

He will report to Kevin Gould, president of Markit.Mr Hunt, a Canadian, started his career in trading when he joined Instinet, the broker, in Hong Kong after years spent as a news photographer at Reuters news agency in the former British colony, where he covered a wide range of events such as the assassination of Rajiv Ghandi in 1991.Mr Hunt later moved to London for Instinet, where he was managing director of Instinet in Europe.He will work on strategy as Markit adapts and expands its business amid rapid changes to market structures, amid regulatory change such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the Emir and Mifid reforms in Europe.
790;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-23T11:03:57Z;Eurozone economic growth slows;;The eurozone is set for a spell of slower economic growth after May data showed the sharpest deceleration in more than two years, according to a closely watched survey.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 17-country region showed Germany and France failed this month to maintain the robust pace of expansion seen at the start of the year.Higher oil prices and inflation, the eurozone debt crisis, fiscal austerity measures and the impact of Japan’s earthquake on supply chains could have taken their toll, economists said.With the indices seen as signalling likely economic trends in coming months, May’s weak data could deflate optimism generated by news earlier this month that eurozone gross domestic product had expanded by 0.8 per cent in the first quarter – more quickly than in the US or the UK.However, growth might simply have slowed to a more sustainable pace after an exceptional spurt at the start of the year.Marco Valli, eurozone economist at UniCredit, said: “This should not be seen as the beginning of a new downturn, rather as a phase of consolidation of the recovery at a time of skyrocketing energy costs.”Readings from the past two months “suggest that growth is likely to have slowed only very modestly in the second quarter, with GDP rising by perhaps 0.7 per cent”, added Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.He warned, however, that growth and labour market trends remained lopsided and “fuelled by France and Germany while the rest of the region saw a near-stagnation of output in May and a further drop in employment.”Accompanying the slower growth, price pressures have also abated, according to Markit, with slower growth in companies’ input costs resulting in fewer raising their selling prices than in previous months.The latest survey is unlikely to change the European Central Bank’s view that the eurozone recovery is solid and capable of withstanding further interest rate increases to head-off possible inflation risks. The ECB raised its main interest rate from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent in April and another increase is widely expected in July.The eurozone “composite” purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 55.4 in May, from 57.8 in April, the lowest for seven months. The drop in the index was the largest since November 2008 – shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank. However, a figure above 50 still indicates an expansion in activity.Germany had a particularly sharp deceleration, led by its manufacturing sector, but that could have reflected largely a technical correction after a very strong first quarter, when German GDP had expanded by 1.5 per cent. The German composite index fell from 59.2 to 56.4.May’s business climate indicator released on Tuesday by the Munich-based Ifo institute will be scrutinised for further signs of growth losing momentum in Europe’s largest economy.
791;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-19T22:10:39Z;Recovery doubts trigger choppy trading;;Renewed doubts about the global economic outlook and lingering concerns over eurozone sovereign debt made for a choppy session for risk assets, as a brace of high-profile stock flotations on either side of the Atlantic attracted huge attention.The day started in broadly positive fashion as the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting were interpreted by the markets as indicating the US central bank would keep policy on hold for some time to come.“Given that the world’s next two most important central banks – the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China – are on a tightening cycle, a continuation of the Fed’s accommodative policy is a positive for risky assets,” said Gavan Nolan credit analyst at Markit.European investors also largely shrugged off data showing that Japan had officially dropped into recession in the first quarter of the year.“Today’s weak GDP data underscore that the Bank of Japan will trail most of the rest of the world in unwinding stimulus and monetary tightening and for that reason relative monetary policy should eventually support a weaker yen,” said Flemming Nielsen, senior analyst at Danske Bank.Indeed, the yen did fall in early trade, slipping to a three-week low against the dollar, although the US currency in turn came under some pressure as a series of weak data releases rekindled doubts about the outlook for the US economy.Most notably, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s latest survey showed a steep drop in factory activity in the US mid-Atlantic region this month, more than offsetting an unexpected fall in weekly initial jobless claims. Also weighing on sentiment were weak existing home sales and leading indicators data.The figures troubled US equities following a positive start, but by the close in New York the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, thanks to a weaker dollar. Shares in professional social network LinkedIn more than doubled in value from their initial public offering price, recalling the heady days of the “dotcom boom”.Meanwhile, commodity trader Glencore’s London debut was less spectacular. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.7 per cent, while in Tokyo, the weak Japanese GDP figures helped push the Nikkei 225 Average down 0.4 per cent.Commodity markets were also unsettled by the weak US data. The benchmark US crude oil price fell back below $100 a barrel and copper dipped back below $9,000 a tonne in London. Gold had a volatile session but failed to retest the $1,500 an ounce level.But the doubts over the US economy did little to bolster core government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down just 1 basis point at 3.17 per cent, while the 10-year German Bund yield held steady at 3.13 per cent.But peripheral sovereign debt and credit default swaps in the capital markets came under fresh pressure after the ECB upped the stakes in its fight against a “soft” restructuring of Greek debt.The bank warned that such action would force it to stop accepting Greek sovereign debt as collateral in its liquidity operations.“What concerns the ECB is that talk of or even acting on a ‘soft-restructuring’ will be seen by financial markets as a precursor to a ‘hard-restructuring’ – for not only Greece but also Portugal and Ireland,” said Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets.“The ECB seems to favour a traditional bail-out alongside hope that Greece will stick to the plan and increase revenue and privatisation proceeds. The problem for politicians is the lack of any guarantee that this already tried – and failed – method will work, especially as it is a costly exercise when it comes to winning over public opinion.”The Greek 10-year government bond yield rose 22bp to 16.02 per cent and its five-year CDS spread widened 28bp to 1,330bp.
792;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-04T10:38:10Z;Mortgage approvals highest in five months;;New mortgage approvals rose to their highest levels in five months in March, according to new data from the Bank of England, while consumer credit continues to be sluggish.The number of mortgages approved for house purchases rose to 47,557, higher than the 46,283 average in the previous six months . The slight pick up in mortgage lending comes as a closely-watched survey showed house prices slipped back in April.However, remortgage activity, which has been picking up in recent months, slipped back. Remortgage approvals totalled 32,116, slightly below the 32,390 average in the previous six months.Separately, a survey of activity in the construction sector came in weaker than expected, with levels dragged down by lower performance in the housing and civil engineering sectors.The Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers hit a headline reading for April of 53.3, down from 56.4 and below expectations.Housing activity fell sharply, reaching 48.07 compared with a reading of 57.13 in March. A reading of 50 indicates activity is stable while one above indicates expansion and below 50 shows activity contracting. However, business expectations rose to their best levels since May 2010.Meanwhile, overall consumer credit rose by £0.1bn in March, a weaker rise than the £0.3bn monthly average seen over the past six months. Within consumer credit, credit cards – the most expensive form of borrowing – rose by £0.2bn while borrowing through other loans and advances contracted by £0.1bn.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, noted that lending had been very low when measured by historical standards. “The overall impression remains that consumer appetite for taking on new borrowing remains limited while there is also an ongoing desire of many consumers to reduce their debt,” Mr Archer said.“Consumer desire to get a tighter grip on their finances is a reflection of current very low and falling consumer confidence and is the consequence of an uncertain and somewhat worrying longer-term outlook for the economy and jobs as the major fiscal squeeze increasingly kicks in,” he added.
793;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UK manufacturing at seven-month low;;Growth in the UK manufacturing sector slowed to its weakest in seven months in April, raising fears that the recovery in the sector of the UK’s economy that has rebounded most rapidly, is already running out of steam.The manufacturing sector purchasing managers’ index reached a level of 54.6, the weakest reading since last September, and down from 56.7 in March and a record of 61.7 in January.Any figure of more than 50 signals that manufacturers are reporting an increase in business activity, and growth in April still appeared to be above the long-running average for the series.The Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which sponsors the survey, warned that the figures implied a rapid deceleration in the manufacturing sector.“The outlook for UK manufacturing is definitely bleaker than it was at the start of the year,” said David Noble, chief executive of Cips. “The sector was racing ahead just a few months ago but there are now clear signs that it is running out of steam.”The most notable slowdown was in new orders, which have fallen from a record reading of 65.2 in January to 51.5 in April. Output is somewhat stronger at 56.5, although that points to the slowest growth since September. Weakening new orders suggest that yet slower output growth lies ahead.Cips and Markit, which undertake the polling for the survey, said that the slowdown in domestic and particularly consumer-related manufacturing was particularly notable, with the sector increasingly reliant on demand from overseas. Export orders were one of the few robust parts of the report, having risen at a slightly faster pace in April than in March, albeit less quickly than at the turn of the year.“The outlook has deteriorated sharply, with new orders growth having collapsed from a booming pace at the start of the year to only register a weak influx of new business in April,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit. “Manufacturers reported that the domestic market has weakened considerably in recent months, with consumer demand in particular shifting into reverse gear. The sector appears to now be completely reliant on export orders to sustain growth.”A slowdown in manufacturing would be particularly worrying as it is the one sector of the economy that has powered ahead in recent months. In the first quarter of the year manufacturing grew by 1 per cent and compared with the first quarter of 2010 the sector was expanding at its fastest since the early 1990s. Exports are growing rapidly thanks in part to the weakening of the pound during the financial crisis. But while manufacturing growth has been rapid recently, most of the services sector has appeared stagnant since the autumn.Meanwhile, output prices from the manufacturing sector remained elevated – and recorded their third highest reading in the series since records began.“April’s CIPS manufacturing survey provides further evidence to suggest that the best days of the industrial recovery are behind us,” said Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics.He pointed out that the data may have been affected by the Japan tsunami, but probably did not reflect weakness later in the month caused by the series of bank holidays over the last fortnight. The official figures therefore could be weaker still.“The issue of weak growth and high inflation will continue to trouble the Bank of England,” said James Knightley, economist at ING Bank NV. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee meets later this week to set interest rates but is thought unlikely to raise rates yet, given recent weaker economic data.
794;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-05-02T09:08:32Z;Indian economic growth adds to inflation woes;Input prices continue to rise rapidly;India’s manufacturing sector expanded strongly in April, adding fresh pressure to inflation, but the pace of growth cooled slightly in the big industrial centres of east Asia, according to the latest monthly data.Purchasing Managers’ Index data for India, published on Monday by HSBC, confirmed that growth remained robust in spite of eight increases in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India over the past year in an attempt to conquer inflation, currently 9 per cent.The April PMI index showed a rise to 58.0, compared with 57.9 in March, indicating that the pace of growth in manufacturing activity strengthened slightly from its high level in March. PMI figures of more than 50 indicate expansion, with numbers below that level indicating contraction.Detailed figures for sub-indices showed that input prices continued to rise rapidly, suggesting that upward pressure on inflation was likely to continue. However, the pace of growth in input prices moderated slightly, with the index falling for the first month since mid-2010, from 68.7 to 66.3.Leif Eskesen, HSBC’s chief economist for India, said the strong PMI numbers were likely to “keep the RBI hawkish”, with a further increase in interest rates possible as soon as Tuesday.In contrast to the rising pace of expansion in India, manufacturing PMI data for South Korea, also released on Monday, showed a slight easing in the pace of growth, as did official and unofficial PMI reports for China, released at the weekend.China’s Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said its PMI measure fell to 52.9 in April from 53.4 in the previous month, indicating continuing growth but at a slightly slower pace.Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the federation, said the official data suggested that growth was slowing in line with demand, according to state media. If sustained, the easing of the pace of growth would help to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures.HSBC’s unofficial China PMI index was flat at 51.8, reflecting “relatively soft market demand”. China has increased interest rates four times since October, but inflation jumped to 5.4 per cent in March, mainly because of rising food prices.South Korea’s PMI slipped to 51.7 from 52.8 in March, signalling a moderation in growth that economists said might reflect a slowdown in export orders caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Japan’s PMI, released on Thursday by the Japan Materials Management Association and Markit, the economics consultancy, showed a further decline caused by the continuing impact of the earthquake.The index hit a two-year low of 45.7, down from 46.4 in March, indicating a significant contraction of activity. The level of incoming new business fell sharply, with the rate of decline the fastest since March 2009, said JMMA/Markit.
795;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-04-29T18:51:02Z;How clearing helped ICE reinforce ties with banks;;In one of the attempts to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis that shook Wall Street and the City to their foundations, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic trained their sights on the freewheeling credit default swaps market.One of the chief solutions they settled on was to move trading of these complex derivatives contracts away from private dealers to a central clearing house, where they could be better monitored.Now, an investigation launched by the European Commission on Friday suggests that regulators fear their efforts may have succeeded too well.Authorities are probing whether the company that has risen to become the continent’s dominant credit default swaps clearing house, ICE Clear Europe – a division of Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange – ran afoul of its competition laws. Of particular interest to investigators are the special fees ICE granted to nine large banks to lock them in as customers.In a related investigation, the Commission is also examining whether a British firm, Markit, has abused its position as the leading provider of information about credit default swaps.Markit is partly owned by 16 of the largest global investment banks, and may have used preferential pricing and other financial data from them to shut out competitors such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, Commission officials say.Markit said it did not believe it had engaged in any inappropriate activity.The investigations mark the latest blow for a fast-growing market that many European politicians have already blamed for exacerbating the sovereign debt crisis that has threatened the euro.Credit default swaps were created to protect investors in the event that a company or government defaulted on a bond. They have since become a popular speculative opportunity for hedge funds and other investors, who propelled their growth.But in the ICE case, in particular, EU officials acknowledge that they risk being perceived as seeking to tear down the very thing they were once asking companies to build.A legislative proposal issued in September by Michel Barnier, the internal market commissioner, explicitly called for many derivatives contracts to be traded through a central clearing house – rather than between parties directly – to limit the risks of default and bring greater stability to the market.“No financial market can afford to remain a Wild West territory,” Mr Barnier said at the time.His counterpart, Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, argues that while a single, large clearing house may be the best arrangement for the broader financial system, it is for the market to determine which company prevails in the fight to build one.“Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive behaviour,” Mr Almunia said. “I hope our investigation will contribute to a better functioning of financial markets.”ICE has declined to comment. The investigation will cast new scrutiny on the work of Jeff Sprecher, IntercontinentalExchange’s down-to-earth founder.Several larger competitors, such as CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange by trading volumes, and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, have vied to build their own credit default swaps clearing houses.But Mr Sprecher edged them out. In the two years since his company launched ICE, it has mopped up most of the market, clearing contracts in the US and Europe with a total notional value of $17,500bn, out of a total market of $22,000bn.Mr Sprecher was able to outplay far bigger exchange groups in part because he had developed a close relationship with the big Wall Street banks that control the credit default swaps market and which had backed ICE’s creation.In large measure, the relationship was based on ICE not trying to change the market, as others attempted.CME, for example, created an electronic platform for swaps trading in collaboration with Citadel, a venture it eventually abandoned because of lack of interest from dealers.Instead, ICE focused on clearing swaps contracts via a profit-sharing arrangement with the dealers, a move that satisfied the demands of regulators to remove counterparty risk from the sector, while allowing banks to continue operating much as they had been before.Credit default swaps clearing is not a great money-spinner: it earned ICE a profit of about $15m last year, with a similar amount going to the dealers.However, it strengthened ICE’s ties with the big banks – a useful thing for a company seeking to pick up other clearing business.Additional reporting by David Oakley in London
796;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-04-29T18:14:56Z;Brussels opens CDS antitrust probes;;The European Commission has opened sweeping antitrust investigations into some of the biggest players in the credit default swaps market, including ICE, the industry’s leading clearing house.The investigations, launched by Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, open a new chapter in the commission’s attempts to bring to heel a market for exotic securities that played a central role in the financial crisis that brought down leading Wall Street investment banks and required hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bail-outs.In the first of two investigations, the commission is examining whether Markit, a British company that provides pricing and other financial information necessary to trade credit default swaps, colluded with 16 banks to dominate the market and edge out competitors such as Thomson-Reuters and Bloomberg.The second investigation centres on Intercontinental Exchange’s European clearing business, ICE Clear Europe, and whether special profit-sharing arrangements and preferential tariffs it granted to nine of those banks in effect closed them off from doing business with competing clearing houses.The banks include some of the world’s largest financial institutions – Bank of America Corporation, Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. All declined to comment.US authorities began a similar probe last year. Mr Almunia said the investigations were intended to improve transparency and fairness in the market.“CDS play a useful role for financial markets and for the economy. Recent developments have shown, however, that the trading of this asset class suffers a number of inefficiencies that cannot be solved through regulation alone,” he said.ICE declined to comment, but Markit said it did not believe it had engaged in any inappropriate activity, adding: “Markit has no exclusive arrangements with any data provider and makes its data and related products widely available to global market participants.”Credit defaults swaps are a form of derivatives contract that was originally created to give investors protection in case a party defaulted.Yet, they have grown rapidly in recent years as speculative investments – something that has worried policymakers, who fear that regulatory scrutiny has not kept pace.The investigation marks a setback for G20 efforts to reform the vast over the counter derivatives market.Central to that effort was regulators’ insistence that previously unregulated derivatives be processed through clearing houses to minimise the risk to the broader financial system in the event of another big default, like that of Lehman Brothers in 2008.That policy sparked a race among big exchanges such as ICE, CME Group and Deutsche Börse to be the first to create clearing services for credit default swaps.

799;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-04-17T23:04:04Z;Marketing executives gloomy over spending;;Marketing executives’ confidence is at its lowest point since the nadir of the recession in early 2009, according to a quarterly survey, as economic uncertainty casts a shadow over the UK media sector.The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising’s Bellwether report, produced with BDO by Markit Economics, found that 25 per cent of respondents had cut their marketing budgets in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 20 per cent who increased their planned spending – the second consecutive net downward revision.Asked about confidence in their own companies, the 300-firm panel was slightly more positive.But discussing the prospects for their industries as a whole, nearly 38 per cent of marketing directors were more pessimistic than three months ago, compared with 26 per cent who were more confident – signalling the “strongest degree of pessimism since Q1 2009, when the economic downturn was at its worst”, the Bellwether report says.Sales promotions spending faces the biggest cutbacks, the survey suggested, while traditional media and internet advertising was still likely to grow.“Although [confidence] is more negative than in recent times it’s not what we saw in 2008-9,” said Alex Hamilton, the economist at Markit who wrote the report. “At the moment I think a lot of firms are in ‘wait and see’ mode…The real message from this survey was that firms are really looking to cut costs and overheads.”Respondents cited the need to control costs and protect margins, cash flow problems, public sector cuts and the uncertain economic climate as reasons for reducing marketing budgets in the first quarter. Reasons to increase investment included new product launches and cheaper advertising rates.“The latest report reflects the unsettled nature of the economy at present and hence the figures reveal a hesitancy that is not surprising,” said Nicola Mendelsohn, president of the IPA and executive chairman at the Karmarama agency. The survey found 39 per cent of respondents planned to increase their total marketing investment this year, while 22 per cent were cutting back compared with 2010.The Advertising Association estimates that advertising spending will grow by 2.9 per cent this year. “Initial budget setting is relatively lacklustre in the context of historical data,” the Bellwether report said.Stewart Easterbrook, chief executive of Starcom Mediavest, told the FT recently that although inflation and the rising oil price had not had a big impact on clients, a drop in consumer confidence – and therefore spending – “will result in more pressure on ad spend”. Channels such as the internet, where returns are more immediately obvious, would benefit, he said.Matt Edwards, managing director of Engine Group, an independent UK agency group, agreed that he had not yet seen the increased pessimism charted in the Bellwether translate into cutbacks among clients. “It’s not that people are pulling budgets and stopping spending but there is a degree of caution before committing to spend,” he said. Ian Whittaker, media analyst at Liberum Capital, said that there had been a “definite shift over the last two to three weeks” that showed the advertising industry’s confidence was wavering. “For TV, January to April looks good – the real question mark is about May and June,” he said.“If that [retail] money doesn’t come through there will be a decline.”He said that large growth in social media and other digital advertising could help boost activity in the rest of the year.Supermarkets’ price competition was encouraging them to keep advertising but other high-street retailers were more uncertain, Mr Whittaker said.However, he said that consumer goods companies such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble – among the world’s biggest spenders – were shifting more of their marketing budgets towards media spending and away from in-store promotions.Last week, Zenith Optimedia, the Publicis-owned media agency, downgraded global forecasts for advertising spending by $2.4bn due to turmoil in the Middle East and the Japanese earthquake.It cut its 2011 global growth forecast to 4.2 per cent, with Western European advertising spending expected to grow by 3.5 per cent this year.
800;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors seek out havens of gold and bonds;;Fears of sovereign debt default, uncertainty about central bank policy and disappointing corporate earnings chipped away at investor confidence this week, prompting a shift away from global equities to the safety of “core” government bonds and gold.Gold, driven by continuing global attention to inflationary pressures, especially in the US and China, touched new records throughout the week, ending at an all-time nominal high of $1,488 an ounce. Silver was at a 30-year peak of $42 an ounce.Dramatic price moves also came in the peripheral eurozone government bond and credit markets as worries about a Greek restructuring intensified.The catalyst for increased speculation largely came from comments by Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, that “further measures” would have to be taken if Greece’s debt sustainability was called into question.“Of course, the markets have been doubting Greece’s solvency for some time, and they duly took Mr Schäuble’s comments as a clear sign that the long-awaited debt restructuring was imminent,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit.“Never mind that Mr Schäuble went on to say that any restructuring before 2013 – when the European Stability Mechanism comes into effect – would be voluntary. And it is hardly a certainty that ‘further measures’ means restructuring and not more of the same austerity policies.”Greek government bond yields soared, with the 10-year spread over German Bunds widening above 10 percentage points. The cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign default also jumped. This price action was replicated for other peripheral eurozone nations, including – worryingly – Spain.Ben May, at Capital Economics, noted that fears of Spain suffering an Irish-style banking meltdown had diminished and that the government appeared to be meeting its fiscal goals.But he warned: “It is too soon to conclude that Spain has turned a corner.“For a start, Ireland’s experience shows that it is difficult to assess the true scale of problems in the banking sector.“Second, despite Spain’s low level of public debt, the public finances may not be in quite as healthy a state as they seem.“Third, the economy faces some strong headwinds, which will make it tough to eliminate the budget deficit.”But the currency markets paid little heed to the fireworks in peripheral debt, with the euro easing only modestly from a 15-month high struck against the dollar at the start of the week as interest rate differentials provided support.And the view that the European Central Bank would continue raising rates in the months to come, while the Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative monetary policy, was reinforced by inflation data on both sides of the Atlantic.Eurozone consumer price inflation rose more than first estimated in March, reaching a 29-month high and reinforcing expectations of further interest rate increases.The latest batch of Chinese data also showed both growth and inflation gathering pace, fuelling speculation of further tightening measures.US core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose by only 0.1 per cent last month, less than the market had expected.Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank, said the data would add to the tendency to defer the first Fed tightening well into 2012. “For the moment it gives the Fed doves additional staying power,” he said.Other observers noted that the year-on-year core inflation rate had crept up from February. “While core inflation still looks benign for now, pressures are slowly building under the hood,” said Teunis Brosens, economist at ING.But Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments, said the Fed’s continued focus on core inflation would extend its loose policy, which would drive gold prices. “We have the Fed keeping us awash in money. Gold is not just a safe haven, it’s key part of the reflationary trend as global growth gets kick-started.”The benign US inflation data fuelled further buying of Treasury bonds, which had benefited in the week from their status as havens in times of turmoil.Over the week, the 10-year US government bonds yield dipped 18 basis points to 3.40 per cent. The 10-year Bund yield fell 9bp to 3.39 per cent. In commodities, copper slid 5.5 per cent over the week and Brent crude oil shed more than $3 to close at $123.43 a barrel.US equity markets saw choppy trading as the first quarter earnings season got off to a shaky start. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent in the week.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.5 per cent over the week, the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo shed 1.8 per cent, and emerging markets stocks fell 2.1 per cent.
801;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Overview: Inflation and EU fears cast shadow;;Fresh concerns over eurozone sovereign debt, global inflation and US jobs ratcheted up the tension in markets that were already extremely nervous about the quarterly corporate earnings season.Remarks from the Greek and German finance ministers, and European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, served to heighten speculation about a Greek debt restructuring.Furthermore, the head of Standard & Poor’s European debt-evaluation group warned that investors might suffer a “haircut” of 50-70 per cent on their holdings of Greek debt if a restructuring took place.“The markets, of course, have been pricing in a restructuring for many months,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit. “But the fact that it could happen before the European Stability Mechanism is in place in 2013 is less than desirable for the authorities.”Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets, said the more important issue was whether the focus on a move by Greece would reduce the chances of a bail-out for Portugal in favour of a restructuring.“The crisis last year showed that policymakers were behind the curve in recognising market pressures related to Greece and its contagion, and it seems that we are rerunning the script with regards to Portugal and the restructuring debate,” he said.“The eurozone is once again walking into the next phase of the crisis, and while bail-outs are a less popular option it is unclear whether the alternative of crystallising losses – via a debt restructuring – is palatable.”Peripheral eurozone government bonds fell across the board, with Greek and Portuguese 10-year yields setting euro-era highs. The cost of insuring against a sovereign debt default also shot higher for both countries.The euro also initially suffered a sharp sell-off as the Greek concerns intensified, but recovered its poise as expectations for further ECB interest rate rises provided support. The single currency briefly dipped below $1.44 before regaining that level.“As long as the Spanish bond market fends off contagion, interest rate differentials are set to remain the primary driving force for euro/dollar,” said Jane Foley, chief currency strategist at Rabobank.“The market has become even more aggressive in its ECB rate view, pricing in just over two further hikes by year-end. In contrast, the market is of the view that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to tighten.”Meanwhile, the recovery of the US labour market was back in focus after data showed that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits had climbed back above 400,000 for the first time since March.And inflation worries came to the fore as investors fretted about consumer prices data due out in the US, China and the eurozone. US producer prices figures released on Thursday, surprised on the upside, said analysts at Action Economics.“Today’s big PPI price gain, and Wednesday’s March report of an eighth consecutive month of huge trade price increases, supports our March CPI forecast of a 0.5 per cent headline gain with a 0.1 per cent core price increase,” Action said.Commodity prices put in mixed performances, with Brent crude slipping back, US WTI oil higher and copper retreating. Gold moved ahead as nervous investors looked for safety.European equities lost ground, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 shedding 0.6 per cent. The S&P 500 spent much of the session lower, but closed fractionally higher.The Vix index of US equity volatility – known as the fear gauge and watched as a barometer of risk aversion – fell 4.6 per cent.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average edged up 0.1 per cent.
802;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-04-07T17:26:04Z;How cup of sake could help save Japan;Too much self-restraint will make things worse, writes Mure Dickie;Battling to win re-election as Tokyo governor, political veteran Shintaro Ishihara has been promising to do his utmost to shield the capital from the economic aftershocks of Japan’s March 11 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis.Yet Mr Ishihara risks deepening the post-disaster slump by simultaneously seeking to stop Tokyo residents from celebrating the arrival of cherry blossoms with their traditional hanami flower-viewing parties.Mr Ishihara can be forgiven for thinking it unseemly to hold a party at a time when more than 100,000 people are huddled in tsunami refuge centres. The 78-year-old former novelist clearly remembers with nostalgia the “beautiful feelings of solidarity” he says Japanese shared during the second world war.But far from helping people in the north-eastern coastal areas devastated by the tsunami, too much self-denying solidarity will only make things worse.Japanese domestic demand was anaemic even before the March 11 disaster and now needs all the help it can get.Growth was expected to return in the current quarter after pausing in the last three months of 2010. But that was before the magnitude 9.0 earthquake disrupted north-eastern factories and infrastructure and the resulting tsunami devastated towns, villages and ports for hundreds of kilometres along the coast.Now the short-term outlook again looks bleak.Japanese manufacturing activity sank to a two-year low in March, according to the Markit/JMMA purchasing managers’ index, which suffered its steepest decline since being introduced in 2001.Such data suggest the hit to activity will be larger than originally feared. Analysts at the independent research house Capital Economics previously expected flat growth for 2011 but now forecast a 1.5 per cent contraction. “The news on Japan’s economy is likely to get worse before it gets better,” they said this week.A big part of the problem is likely to be shortages of generating capacity caused by the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and damage to other power stations. Tokyo Electric Power, which runs the crippled atomic plant and serves the capital, has been forced to introduce rolling blackouts at periods of peak demand.The impact of power shortages has been reduced by extraordinary efforts by government, business and the public to show jishuku, or “self-restraint”, by switching off non-essential equipment and lights.But Hiroshi Mikitani, founder and chief executive of Rakuten, Japan’s largest online retailer, warns against embracing jishuku for its own sake.Mr Mikitani has switched off half the lights in his personal office and his group has cut electricity consumption by about 30 per cent. But he says the most important response to the power problem will be to redistribute demand away from peak times rather than suppressing activity. “We don’t want to be too conservative. It’s bad for the economy,” he says.Others also see a middle ground between sympathy for the disaster victims and business as usual. One senior banker says he is dining out on his own account to make up for cancelled work dinners at small family-run restaurants that badly need the business. “The government ought to start saying, ‘Go out and party, but don’t drink too much’,” he says.Such moderation might not be enough for Mr Ishihara, who is favoured to win a fourth term as the governor of Tokyo on Sunday.Yet he would be wise to listen to those of his opponents who have turned out at Tokyo’s central Ueno park to support the brave souls determined to picnic under the cherry trees.Hanami gatherings can be raucous, but Japan’s love affair with the cherry blossom is rooted in large part in the flower’s status as a symbol of the beautiful but transitory nature of life – an appropriate theme given recent events.And even if revellers’ aims can be more self-indulgent than philosophical, their enthusiastic consumption of drinks, snacks and associated services will help to keep the wheels of the economy turning.If he wins, Mr Ishihara should consider coming out for a cup of sake himself.
803;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-31T13:25:12Z;Quake disaster hits Japan manufacturing;;Japanese manufacturing activity sank to a two-year low in March, underlining the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on economic activity in the country.The damage caused by the March 11 disaster, which has claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people, severely disrupted the production of car parts, electronics and other products, forcing global companies such as Toyota to halt manufacturing.The disruption has been exacerbated by the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant – sparked by the tsunami – that has contributed to an electricity shortage that has led to rolling power cuts in the Tokyo region, which accounts for 38 per cent of the Japanese economy.The seasonally adjusted Markit/JMMA Japan manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 46.4 in March from 52.9 the previous month, the steepest decline since the data began in 2001, according to a Markit release on Thursday.New orders fell at the steepest rate in two years, while cost inflation rose at the fastest pace in two and a half years, according to the release.The PMI index gives a snapshot of overall activity in manufacturing, including output, order flows and pricing, with a figure above 50 indicating growth in activity and a figure below that level indicating a contraction.Markit also faced difficulty in collecting the data, highlighting just how strongly this disaster has affected Japanese manufacturing. Markit received just 67 per cent of the average number of replies. It had just 5 per cent of average replies from Tohoku, 85 per cent from Chubu – where many car factories are based – and 60 per cent from the Kanto region.The disaster has underscored just how important Japan is in the global supply chain of a whole variety of goods, with production of rubber products and plastics also heavily disrupted. Global carmakers have been particularly hard-hit, because of tight inventory management and a high proportion of vehicle electronics components made in Japan.“This earthquake and tsunami will fundamentally change the thinking of companies because it reminds them of the importance of really diversifying [component sourcing geographically],” said Hans-Paul Bürkner, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group.“Distributing your suppliers around the world is key. It could be the same company but with different manufacturing sites. There’s much more sensitivity to risk management and operational risk and [this] will change the landscape of supplies around the world.”He added that manufacturing could return to normal by the end of June as companies and households made efforts to reduce their power usage.
804;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-24T10:41:52Z;Japan quake fails to dent eurozone recovery;;Japan’s earthquake has had scant economic impact so far on the eurozone, which saw robust growth, rapid job creation – and mounting inflation pressures this month, according to a closely watched survey.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 17-country region showed the pace of expansion in private-sector activity dipped only slightly compared with February, when growth was the strongest for more than four years. Prices charged by businesses grew at the fastest pace in almost three years.Japan’s earthquake, which occurred just as data for the survey started to be collected, “had added to uncertainty but at the moment it has not had any discernible impact,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices. Companies were more concerned about events in the eurozone and fiscal austerity measures, Mr Williamson said. However, disruption to supply chains could still hit activity levels in coming weeks and months.The latest data survey added to evidence of a strong eurozone growth rebound in the first quarter of this year and will strengthen the European Central Bank’s determination to press ahead in April with a planned interest rate increase. ECB policymakers see a “normalisation” of monetary policy as long overdue and have stepped up warnings recently of the dangers of leaving borrowing costs too low for too long. The ECB has left its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent since May 2009.“One doesn’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand that this report makes an ECB rate hike in April a near certainty,” said Peter Vanden Houte, European economist at ING in Brussels.Eurozone growth slowed late last year, largely as a result of bitter winter weather. But the purchasing managers’ indices indicated private sector output in the first three months of 2011 expanded at the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2006.Growth continued to be led by manufacturing, although activity in the sector slowed in March, but service industry activity picked up in March to show the fastest growth since August 2007.The indices again showed Germany and France pulling ahead of the rest of the eurozone. The average rate of output expansion in the eurozone’s two largest member states was the fastest in almost five years but was modest elsewhere and weaker than in February. Similarly, employment in France and Germany grew in March at the fastest pace since July 2007. But the rest of the eurozone reported further job losses.Prices charged by businesses for goods and services rose for the eight consecutive month in March with the rate of inflation unchanged from February, when it was the highest since July 2008. Prices charged by manufacturers saw by far the steepest increases.
805;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors wrestle with meltdown risk;;"As Japan’s nuclear crisis escalated this week, financial traders around the world scrambled to become instant experts on the risks of atomic power.GLG Partners, the hedge fund owned by London’s Man Group, had an in-house expert: Simon Savage, head of risk, started at Britain’s National Nuclear Corp after Chernobyl.“I was able to offer a sense of perspective at what we’re really dealing with here,” he says. “When words like ‘meltdown’ and ‘going critical’ are being thrown around people think ‘bloody hell, it could blow a major hole in the planet’. That’s just not going to happen.”Traders elsewhere relied on industry sources or hastily contacted academics. What all had in common was that expert views on the likely outcome provided little guide to the direction of the market. As one Japanese minister observed, every time smoke rose from the stricken reactor, share prices fell, even though it meant little.“Clearly we’re trading an event that nobody understands the implications of,” admits one prominent hedge fund manager.The outcome of that lack of understanding was shown in the wild market swings all week. At its worst, the Japanese stock market was down just over 20 per cent – a full-on crash. It then leapt, making back almost half its loss in two days, to end Friday down 10.2 per cent.The country’s credit risk shot up; Markit data show Japan credit default swaps jumped almost a third to 115 basis points, ranking it as riskier than Mexico or Panama.To add to the sense of crisis in financial markets, there was also an extraordinary spike in the yen on Thursday. In 20 minutes, it shot through its record high against the dollar, prompting the first co-ordinated currency intervention in a decade.These effects do not just come down to fear.Financial markets are terrible at pricing highly unlikely, but disastrous events. Even reasonably likely events may be ignored if they do not fit the quarterly reporting cycle or the mathematical risk models that limit many traders – as was shown by the 2007 subprime crisis. Then, models relied on recent US house price data, and so ignored the possibility of price falls.Even in Japan, a very seismically active region, equities could not be prepared for a quake and tsunami on a scale barely known in living memory.“The markets don’t do a good job because by definition these are events that are highly unlikely to happen,” says Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, the fund manager.It took investors days to figure out the economic ramifications of the quake, while nuclear catastrophe loomed. That left an information gap that markets were not equipped to fill.“Human nature causes you to exaggerate this kind of thing, typically by many multiples,” says Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist at fund manager GMO. “If you list things where the psychological effect is far greater than the expected value you would put nuclear at the top. Not that it isn’t a disaster, but the world is particularly sensitive to Three Mile Island-type events. Even the dreadful consequences of Chernobyl were only a tiny fraction of what was feared.”For Mr Grantham, shares overreacted. “It may knock 2 per cent off [Japan’s] GDP,” he estimates. “And you saw 20 per cent knocked off the market.”Market panic is really no different to other panics. Reports of a surge in American orders for potassium iodide tablets, designed to protect against certain radiation-induced cancers, fit a well-known pattern: sales of earthquake insurance can be relied on to boom just after a quake.Financially this effect appears most clearly in options, which investors can use to protect against share price falls.The cost of protection against shares dropping soared in Japan as the market tumbled. Implied volatility on the Nikkei 225, indicating the cost of options, leapt from 21 to 70, though still some way off the 92 reached after Lehman Brothers collapsed. On Friday it fell back to 50.But just because the market initially overreacted does not mean the quake and nuclear calamity will not hurt the economy.Japan faces a heavy clean-up bill, power shortages, and the continued risk of a major radiation leak.Longer term, the world faces renewed constraints on nuclear power, meaning more demand and higher prices for fossil fuels, and possibly alternative energy (as the markets woke up to midweek). This comes as investors try to grasp the implications of another very serious but unlikely event: the possibility that rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia disrupt oil supplies.The markets took a long time to understand the importance of the Arab ­revolutions. They are still struggling to work out how far revolt will spread. As one large London hedge fund manager put it when asked how to assess the risks of Saudi shares (cheap on many measures): “You just don’t. You close your eyes, and you buy. Saudi must be where the US love of democracy runs out.”Extreme risks will always be with us, and almost impossible to predict. One prediction: most investors will continue to find it easier to ignore them.Since initial publication, this article has been amended to correct the title of Jeremy Grantham."
806;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-09T23:42:37Z;Exports surge narrows trade deficit in goods;;Britain’s deficit in trade in goods narrowed by much more than expected in January, raising hopes that the economy can rebalance away from its dependence on domestic consumption of goods and services.The Office for National Statistics said the deficit on trade in goods fell to £7.1bn from a revised £9.7bn shortfall in December, and was well below the £8.5bn average forecast by economists.The ONS said December’s record shortfall reflected, in part, unusually heavy imports of aircraft ahead of a key tax change at the start of the year as well as heavy snow, which may have blocked the shipment of goods overseas. The balance for January was also aided by a sharper rise in exports than imports.Philip Rush, economist at Nomura, said the latest reading appeared more than a bounce back from December’s poor figures, almost halving the record total trade deficit in that month.It was consistent with the surge in export orders seen in surveys of the UK’s manufacturing sector, and left trade on course to make a long-forecasted contribution to gross domestic product growth in the first quarter.Excluding goods such as oil, where prices move erratically, the adjusted volume of exports was 6.1 per cent higher in January than in December, while the volume of imports was a more modest 1.9 per cent higher. Net imports of oil, where prices are rising rapidly, posted a sharp rise.“This is welcome news for the UK economy and signals a further rebalancing of the economy towards export-led manufacturing growth,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit group.“For many companies, it is the strength of demand in overseas markets, rather than the exchange rate, which is the most important factor behind export sales success, and, in that respect, global economic growth is currently the fastest for almost five years.”Exports to all the UK’s most significant partners expanded in January, with the exception of sales to Ireland and Italy. Imports from significant partners fell, with the exception of goods from France and Germany, which increased slightly.Exports to China, while still relatively small, are up 29.4 per cent over the three months to January compared with the same period a year earlier. Imports, by contrast, are up by 25.9 per cent over the year.The seasonally adjusted surplus on trade in services was £4.1bn, against £4.2bn in December, with the volume of exports falling by £0.1bn and the volume of imports falling by a smaller amount.Overall, the balance of trade in goods and services narrowed to -£3bn in January from December’s -£5.5bn.Some economists urged caution in reading too much into the latest data. “The rebound in exports at least partly reflects a post-snow rebound. Note that a similar pattern was seen during the snow in January 2010,” said Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics. “Meanwhile, the drop in imports is partly just a reversal of the sharp rise in aircraft imports ahead of a tax change at the start of the year. “
807;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-09T15:16:28Z;Icap to launch venture capital tech fund;;Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, is to launch a venture capital fund aimed at start-up companies developing technology to specialised parts of the financial industry such as post-trade services.Called Euclid Opportunities, the fund will offer seed capital and mentoring to early-stage companies that are developing new technology for post-trade services, such as clearing and settlement. Icap declined to say how much it was committing to the fund.Regulators in Washington and Brussels are writing rules for legislation that will reshape market structures. Many want over-the-counter (OTC), or privately-negotiated, derivatives to be moved on to exchanges or other electronic platforms to increase pricing transparency in such markets, parts of which were blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.Clearing, a key post-trade service, has emerged as a key component of derivatives reform, with regulators insisting that as many OTC products as possible be processed through clearing houses as well. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that the trade goes ahead even if one party defaults.“The rate of regulatory reform in global financial markets is driving unprecedented demand for new approaches, methods and practices,” said Mark Beeston, chief executive of Icap’s Portfolio Risk Services. “Identifying solutions to the challenges of tomorrow is one way that Icap can remain at the forefront of innovation in the post-trade space.”The changing marketplace has led many of the biggest operators to snap up small specialist technology firms. Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, last year bought FTEN, a privately held US company specialising in pre-trade risk management while Markit bought risk analytics business QuiC.“Euclid will bridge the gap between underfunded technology innovators and the needs of stakeholders in today’s financial markets,” said Steve Gibson, managing director at Euclid.
808;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Survey reinforces fears for services sector;;The service sector weakened last month, according to a closely watched index, adding to fears that the largest part of the economy was in feeble shape even before accelerated cuts in public spending hit.The purchasing managers index for services fell from 54.5 in January to 52.6, where a figure of more than 50 indicates companies are reporting rising activity.The index is now well below its long term average of 55.1 and suggests that after rebounding in the first month of the year from a snow-hit December, private services companies have returned to the sluggish trends seen seen since late last summer.Employment fell for the fifth month in a row, albeit at a slower pace. Input prices remain elevated, underlining the risk of slow growth and higher inflation facing the UK economy.“With activity not rising sufficiently to generate jobs growth, there remains concern that the private sector as a whole will struggle to offset public sector employment cuts,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit, the polling company that produces the PMI survey.The service sector was the key force behind the surprise decline in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of the year. The weaker services PMI figures follow more robust numbers for the manufacturing and construction sectors.“Seeing as this is the largest component of the UK economy it more than offsets the positive news from the manufacturing and construction PMIs released over the past couple of days. Indeed, with the CBI retail sales survey and John Lewis retail sales numbers also providing significant disappointment in the last couple of weeks, the outlook for GDP growth remains poor in our view,” said James Knightley, economist at ING Bank.But although growth looks weak across the private sector services – which excluded retail, wholesale and government activities – there were some more encouraging elements to the report.The sub-index of the PMI for new business was at 53.4, down slightly from 54.3 in January, but aside from that the strongest growth since last June and not far below the long-term average for the index.Business confidence is not far from its historical average and, although input prices are rising fast, companies do not appear to be able to pass on the rises to their customers as prices charged are increasing at close to normal rates.Markit said that combined figures for services, manufacturing and construction for the first two months of the year pointed to growth of about 0.5 per cent across the economy in the first quarter.However, the PMI figures failed to register the fall in GDP in the final quarter of last year,and many economists expect stronger growth in the first quarter as the economy bounces back from the snow-afflicted December.
809;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-02T22:41:29Z;Rise in crude propels gold to record high;Fighting in Libya fuels fears of long civil war;Simmering tensions in the Middle East kept oil prices elevated and gold at record levels, creating an extremely nervous and volatile backdrop for equities amid concerns about the potential for rampant energy costs to derail the global recovery.Fighting between rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces in eastern Libya fuelled fears that the country could descend into a long civil war, heightening worries about prolonged supply disruptions. Nagging concerns that civil unrest could spread further across the region added to the upward pressure on crude prices.“Persistent uncertainty in the Middle East-north Africa region continues to support fears of contagion, while lost output from countries like Libya and the increasing likelihood of a push back in foreign investment is set to support longer-term prices even further,” said Amrita Sen, analyst at Barclays Capital.Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit, said the market’s main near-term concerns centred around Saudi Arabia and Iran, Opec’s two biggest producers.“The Opec plan is for Saudi to cover any supply shortfalls caused by the unrest in Libya, so the potential for turmoil there will obviously place upward pressure on the oil price,” Mr Nolan said. “There are signs that the contagion is spreading to Iran amid reports that there has been a major crackdown on protests, though the government is denying that any protests have taken place at all.”Brent crude settled up $0.93 a barrel at $116.35 – within sight of last week’s 29-month high near $120. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, jumped $2.60 to $102.23.The latest spike in oil prices drove gold to a record peak above $1,440.That pressed US equities, but the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report said that the labour market was steadily improving.The S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent, though it was below its opening level following stronger than expected private-sector jobs data from ADP.Analysts noted that the ADP figures were an increasingly poor guide to the official non-farm payrolls report, due out on Friday.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.6 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo tumbled 2.4 per cent – its biggest one-day fall for six months.Credit markets were also unsettled by the upswing in crude. The iTraxx Europe index, a gauge of the costs of insuring European corporate bonds from default, moved back above 100 basis points, according to Markit prices.US government bonds were sold off following the Beige Book’s release, and despite Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, refusing to rule out more stimulus during testimony to US lawmakers. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was 8bp higher at 3.48 per cent.However, the Swiss franc – typically a haven in times of turmoil – reached a fresh record high against the dollar as the US currency markets remained out of favour on yield considerations.Sterling rose to a 13-month high above $1.63 and the euro hit its highest level for nearly four weeks against the dollar, coming within a whisker of reaching $1.39, amid expectations that the European Central Bank would ratchet up its hawkish stance on inflation at its policy meeting on Thursday. This view was bolstered by robust January eurozone industrial producer prices data.But Elwin De Groot, macro strategist at Rabobank, warned that the ECB’s bark might prove stronger than its bite in coming months.“We think the market has got ahead of itself by pricing in nearly 75bp of [rate] hikes by the year’s end, with the first hike coming as early as May/June,” he said. “While the macroeconomic environment may be improving, the peripheral debt crisis has hardly been resolved.”
810;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-03-02T12:12:37Z;Construction sector activity picks up;;Construction sector activity expanded in February at the fastest pace since June, with a widespread pick-up in housing, commercial development and civil engineering, according to a closely watched survey.According to the Markit/CIPS monthly survey of purchasing managers, the sector recorded a headline reading of 56.6, up from 53.7 in January, powered by a rise in new orders. Employment, however, continued to contract, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months.“The latest figures therefore suggest that having contracted by 2.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year, the Office for National Statistics measure of construction should bounce back into positive territory in the first quarter of 2011,” said Sarah Ledger, economist at Markit.Overall, the ONS reported that the UK economy contracted by 0.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2010 and the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which is leaning towards a rate rise to curb inflation, has said it wants to wait to see whether activity in the first quarter of this year is more robust.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, noted that construction only accounts for about 6.3 per cent of gross output as measured by gross domestic product and that an improvement in the sector may not make a big difference overall.He also noted that the construction sector faces a “challenging environment”. “Public spending cuts, still tight credit conditions and a subdued housing market are particular problems for the construction sector. In addition, soaring input prices are squeezing construction companies’ margins,” he said.New orders rose to 56.6 in February, a strong rise from the 52.5 in January. However, inflationary pressures are also building. The input prices sub-index hit a reading of 73 after an already high reading of 67.3 in January, showing the fastest rate of price rises since August 2008 when inflation was close to 5 per cent in Britain.Businesses remain upbeat about their outlook. The business expectations sub-index registered 61.9, down from 64.1 in January but still strong. A reading over 50 indicates that activity is expanding rather than contracting.However, employment continues to decline, according to the index. The employment sub-index registered 48.9, although it is better than the readings in recent months and is the highest level since June 2010.
811;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-02-03T20:40:01Z;Services sector in January rebounds;;Activity in Britain’s services sector may not be as weak as official data had suggested, according to a survey. But the Markit/CIPS poll of purchasing managers for the PMI index points to rising inflationary pressures.The survey showed a headline reading of 54.5 in January, the highest since May 2010, and comes on the heels of a strong result in a related survey for the manufacturing sector. Economists pooled by Thomson Reuters had an average forecast of 51.3, where a reading above 50 indicates expansion.The input prices subsidiary index within the headline PMI jumped to 65.8 from 60.5 in December, the highest reading since August 2008 as inflation hit 5 per cent and the strongest one-month rise in the survey’s history.Prices charged for services by companies also rose at their fastest rate since September 2008 as businesses sought to pass on not only their own rising costs but the expense of the VAT rise to 20 per cent.The data fuelled speculation that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee might bring forward the date at which it begins to raise interest rates from their present level of 0.5 per cent, where they have held for nearly two years.At its meeting next week the MPC will also finalise preparation of its quarterly Inflation Report, which offers a longer-term guide to likely policy moves.“This is a markedly better survey than expected, although there was always going to be a recovery in services activity from December’s weather-related hit to activity,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.Sterling money markets are predicting a better than even chance of a rate rise to 0.75 per cent in May and overwhelming odds of a rate increase to that level by August.Economists at Goldman Sachs said PMI measures for the manufacturing, construction and services sector were pointing to an economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3 per cent, and the trend appears to be more than a weather-related bounce. Forecasts of a double-dip recession, they said, were overplayed.One economist added: “It’s hard to see how that can happen when numbers like these are coming in, and we continue to expect a combination of revisions to fourth-quarter growth and growth in the first quarter of 1.0 per cent or more.”Alan Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas, noted that fourth quarter gross domestic product, which recorded a drop of 0.5 per cent, was mostly weighed down by the poor performance of the nation’s services sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of all business activity.“The business services component of GDP was the biggest subtraction from growth during Q4. That series correlates closely with the services sector CIPS,” Mr Clarke said. “Hence the bounce in the latter is telling us that the weakness in Q4 GDP was likely to have been temporary and we should brace for a strong first-quarter GDP reading.”However, the survey was not all good news. The employment sub-index registered 48.63, marginally better than that of snow-troubled December but a level that still indicates that jobs are contracting. The services employment trend raises doubts about the private sector’s ability to absorb large numbers of workers about to lose their jobs in the nation’s public sector.
812;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-02-01T20:42:00Z;Conflicting data paint picture of a two-speed economy;;"Conflicting data on Tuesday presented a picture of a two-speed economy that is likely to sharpen the dilemma the Bank of England’s policy setters face when they gather for their monthly meeting next week.Output from the UK manufacturing sector surged to a record high in January, according to a closely watched survey, with readings for new orders showing a particularly sharp rise. Offsetting that positive finding were new data showing that lending to businesses and households was very weak in December, coupled with news that the Nationwide house price survey showed a 0.1 per cent decline in January from a month earlier.The Markit/CIPS survey for the purchasing managers’ index rose to 62 in January from 58.7 in December, the highest reading since the survey was created in 1992. Levels of new orders rose at the fastest rate in the survey’s history.Underscoring the growth message – given the historical link between expansion and rising prices – the survey also flashed a danger signal on inflation. Input prices – the cost of goods that manufacturers need to assemble their products – registered their highest reading on record. Markit, which compiles the index, said average purchase prices had risen at the steepest pace in the survey’s history, with more than three-fifths of companies reporting an increase.Moreover, the employment sub-category of the index rose from 57.8 to 58.8, a bright spot in an economy that is hoping for the creation of private sector jobs at a time when large-scale public sector redundancies are expected.The interest rate futures market, which reflects expectations of how rates will move, went from calculating a 50 per cent chance of a quarter-point rise in Bank rates in May to a 75 per cent chance after the numbers were released.Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, noted that the results of a similar survey for the UK’s much larger services sector was due later this week and if it, too, portrayed a picture of strong growth, that might cause the Bank’s monetary policy committee to consider whether the 0.5 per cent fall in fourth-quarter gross domestic product was likely to be revised upwards sharply.“If [the next] numbers are strong, it may persuade the MPC to look through the GDP figures,” Mr Barr said. “The PMIs have the greatest ability to project revisions to official data.”Some economists cautioned against reading too much into the PMI data, noting that the survey measured month-to-month changes in demand, not overall levels of output.George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank,
said that even with the strong growth seen in January, manufacturing output, reflected in GDP data, remained about 9 per cent below its level in the first quarter of 2008, before the UK slid into recession.In any case, offsetting the strong message from the manufacturing survey were new data from the Bank showing that lending to private non-financial companies contracted again in December, that approvals for loans to buy homes fell to a 21-month low and that a key measure of money supply is contracting.The Bank’s data show that lending to private, non-financial companies – the backbone of the nation’s economy – fell by £6.3bn in December from November and for the last three months of 2010 contracted at an annualised rate of
6.2 per cent.Mortgage approvals fell to 42,563 in December, a larger drop than expected. Remortgage activity also fell back to 30,595 after a brief rise in November. Net mortgage lending contracted during the month by £298m as households paid back more than they borrowed in new loans. During the past six months, the number of new home loan approvals has averaged 47,433 while net mortgage lending has averaged £600m.Over all, the data suggest very sluggish lending to the household sector. The rate at which total net lending to households is growing, looked at over the previous six-month or 12-month periods, is the slowest since the Bank began keeping records in 1988. On these measures, net lending is expanding at rates of 0.4 and 0.7 per cent."
813;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-02-01T20:13:34Z;PMI data raise fears on global inflation;;Global manufacturing activity grew at a record rate in January as the international recovery powered into 2011, pushing up commodity prices and contributing to inflationary pressures worldwide.Surveys of purchasing managers in all leading economies, published on Monday, showed strong activity, order books and hiring intentions.A composite global PMI index, compiled by JPMorgan and Markit economics, stood at 57.2 in January – up from 55.6 in December and the highest reading on this measure since the series began in 1998.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “The manufacturing recovery has regained traction, but even more pleasing is that the [global manufacturing] labour market has begun to create jobs.”The positive figures sent stock markets in Europe and the US sharply higher.The strong manufacturing recovery has boosted demand for commodities, sending input prices to a 30-month high. Cost inflation in most large industrial regions has risen to its highest level since July 2008.The rise in input prices will add to concerns that the global economy is hitting resource bottlenecks even as employment and manufacturing activity in advanced economies remain far below the pre-crisis trend levels.Across Asia, manufacturing growth remained strong, but factory-gate prices were rising rapidly .In the US, manufacturers said activity was growing at the fastest rate since 2004 . In Europe, the strength in activity trickled down to Ireland and Spain, but Germany continued to lead the way.Mauray Harris, of UBS, said the pick-up in manufacturing suggested the annualised rate of growth was on track to reach 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, up from 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.But Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, cautioned against optimism that manufacturing employment would help solve the US unemployment problem, noting that the manufacturing sector is a relatively small employer. “The employment index has been at a relatively high level for some months now, but manufacturing payrolls have actually continued to decline,” he said.In Europe, the strength in reported manufacturing activity trickled down to Ireland and Spain but Germany continued to lead the way and Greece has yet to show much improvement.Across Asia, manufacturing growth remained strong but factory-gate prices were rising rapidly. Leif Eskesen, HSBC’s India chief economist, said strong growth gave companies more leeway to pass on price rises. “Inflation pressures are coming from all sides, demand and supply, and international commodity prices are now adding to the challenge,” he said.The global manufacturing recovery started at the beginning of 2009 after the shock of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy began to wane and, apart from a dip last summer, has been on a steadily rising trend.Global industrial production grew at annual rates above 10 per cent for much of 2009 and 2010, putting pressure on oil, energy and water resources. The resulting cost pressures are similar to those in 2008, which squeezed household and corporate incomes and contributed to the subsequent contraction in demand.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport in New York, Kevin Brown in Singapore and Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt

Too bad they hardly matter;If there had been a Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index at Britain’s zenith a century and a half ago, world markets would have paid close attention. But the response to January’s positive reading was almost entirely local, and even that – a 0.7 per cent increase in the value of the British pound against the dollar, and 0.2 per cent against the euro – may have been excessive.The PMI was the highest since the series was created in 1992. The overall reading of 62 (where any number above 50 signals expansion rather than recession) was well above December’s 59 and the expected 58.But there are important caveats. First, while the UK manufacturing sector may be roaring back, the recovery is pretty much global. The comparable eurozone and US numbers for January were more than respectable: 57 and 61 respectively.Second, UK manufacturing is not what it used to be. As Barclays Capital points out, the share of manufacturing in the UK’s gross value added has shrunk from 20 per cent to 11 per cent since the last big recession two decades ago. The share of employment has fallen from 17 per cent to 8 per cent. The services PMI now matters far more – and its latest reading was just below 50.Finally, in the UK and elsewhere, the strong manufacturing PMI readings came with reports of even stronger upward pressure on prices. Central bankers will not welcome that development, even though services matter much more for the overall rate of inflation.The rise in sterling makes sense if inflation fears push the Bank of England into raising interest rates sooner than previously expected. But gross domestic product declined in the fourth-quarter. Add in Tuesday’s news on house prices (down slightly on the Nationwide index) and consumer credit (flat) and the Bank may instead focus on the reduced importance of manufacturing in the nation’s economy.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
815;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Contagion fears rattle Arab markets;;Arab financial markets are being rocked by Egypt’s political turmoil, with several stock markets continuing to drop and the cost of insuring against default spiking across the region.While Egypt’s stock market remains closed after shedding over a fifth of its value in January, credit default swaps – a kind of default insurance – on Egyptian debt rose 17 basis points to 445 basis points on Monday, according to Markit, a data provider.Moody’s on Monday downgraded Egypt’s debt rating one notch to Ba2, with a negative outlook, citing worries that “escalating political tensions” will worsen the government’s already stretched financial position.Saudi Arabia’s bourse, the largest in the region, fell a further 1.2 per cent after dropping 8 per cent on Saturday. CDS on Saudi sovereign debt edged up 29 basis points to 120 basis points. CDSs also rose in Tunisia, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar and Lebanon, according to Markit.Uncertainty surrounding the political future of Egypt– in the past touted as a potential “Arab tiger” by some analysts – have infected broader emerging market investor sentiment. The spread on Markit’s main emerging market CDS index, the Markit iTraxx SovX CEEMEA, has widened by 20 basis points over the past week.Several stock markets in the region recovered some of their losses from Sunday – when most fell sharply – but bourses in Bahrain, Dubai and Jordan continued to drop.“Continued concerns about unrest in the Middle East could provide an unsettling backdrop to global markets at the start of this week,” Ann Wyman, head of emerging market research at Nomura, said in a note published on Monday.“A broad re-evaluation of domestic political stability in countries throughout the region (and even some beyond the region) is under way as the Egyptian political crisis deepens,” she added.Unrest in Egypt has also rocked commodity prices, and has contributed to a jump in emerging market money rates.The yield on JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ELMI+ index of short-term debt in emerging markets rose to 2.5 per cent on Friday, from a record low 1.74 per cent on December 31, according to Bloomberg.Overseas borrowing costs also jumped, sending the extra yield on developing-nation dollar bonds over US Treasuries to a two-month high of 2.77 percentage points today, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI+.The price of cotton, of which Egypt is a significant exporter, has increased, and concerns over shipping through the Suez Canal have caused a spike in oil prices. Gold prices have also gained due to increased risk aversion.On the other hand, the price of wheat, of which Egypt is the world’s largest importer, has softened.“Market apprehensions over uncertain prospects for a more general geopolitical realignment could continue to weigh,” Ms Wyman wrote.
816;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Political woes spur flight to havens;;Global stocks ended an intriguing week on a negative note as mounting geopolitical concerns sent oil prices spiralling higher and triggered flows into the havens of US Treasury bonds, gold and the dollar.The escalating unrest in Egypt added a fresh dynamic to markets already showing signs of shifting their concerns away from peripheral eurozone debt to the fiscal headaches faced by other developed nations.In commodities, Brent oil climbed to within a whisker of the $100 a barrel mark, while gold recovered much of the losses incurred earlier in the week. The yield on the US Treasury bond was down 8 basis points on the week at 3.33 per cent.Some strategists suggested investors had been guilty of underpricing political risk in emerging markets.“Investors have been focused, rightly, on the improving economic fundamentals of many countries in the less developed world,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit.“But politics matters, particularly in sovereigns with unstable, undemocratic systems.”The week’s main surprise came courtesy of a one-notch downgrade to Japan’s long-term credit rating by Standard & Poor’s. The agency cited Japan’s lack of a “coherent strategy” to tackle its debt burden.While the move had only limited impact on Japanese asset markets – in part due to the low level of foreign ownership of the country’s government bonds – the news set off alarm bells elsewhere.“The big question is whether other countries like the UK and possibly even the US could be downgraded as well,” said analysts at Danske Bank.“Contrary to Japan, both countries depend on foreign investors to finance their public debt, which implies that a downgrade of these two sovereigns could fuel a more severe market reaction.”Rival rating agency Moody’s Investors Service followed the S&P move with a warning that the lack of action by the US government on its deficit had increased the likelihood of a negative outlook on the country’s triple A rating.Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office highlighted this week the fiscal dangers facing the US as it revised up its forecast for the fiscal 2011 deficit by nearly 40 per cent to a record $1,480bn. President Barack Obama, in his State of the Union address, called for a freeze on non-discretionary spending for the next five years, falling short of Republican demands for spending cuts.But there were no shocks from the Federal Reserve as the US central bank reiterated its ultra-accommodative policy stance in a unanimous decision. And there was some comfort from news that the US economy had grown at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, close to expectations, particularly as strong consumption had been the main driver.Meanwhile, extremely strong demand for the eurozone bail-out fund’s debut bond issue helped to further ease concerns about the region’s periphery. Demand for the €5bn European financial stability facility bond reached €44.5bn.“This is a major sign of confidence,” said Stefan Angele, head of investment management at Swiss and Global Asset Management. “It also proves that market expectations are pricing in a lot of hope that EU policymakers will put into place strong reforms.”Sentiment was further bolstered by Spain’s move to force its regional savings banks to raise more capital – although its estimate of the amount needed was greeted with scepticism by analysts. This increased optimism towards the region was cited as a factor behind the euro’s advance to a two-month high against the dollar above $1.37.However, credit default swap spreads for most of the peripheral nations, a gauge of the cost of insuring against sovereign default, rose through the week, and the yield on the Portuguese 10-year government bond pushed back through 7 per cent – a level widely seen as unsustainable and a possible trigger for a bail-out.The euro also benefited from a pick-up in inflation expectations following robust German consumer price data and some hawkish comments from a European Central Bank official.The single currency spent much of the week trading above $1.37, although it eased back on Friday.The UK, burdened with inflation that is nearly twice the Bank of England’s target rate, suffered a further blow this week as data showed the economy had contracted in the last quarter of 2010. The news sent sterling and UK gilt yields sliding, and produced a wider-reaching tremor in the markets as “double-dip” concerns were rekindled.Friday’s equity sell-off left the S&P 500 suffering its heaviest one-day fall since August, ending 0.6 per cent lower over the week. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.5 per cent although the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose 0.8 per cent, in spite of the S&P downgrade.
817;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-27T16:08:20Z;Retailer survey shows strong January sales;;"Shoppers took to Britain’s high streets in January in greater numbers than last year, according to a closely watched survey, suggesting that the rise in VAT did little to dampen enthusiasm for post-Christmas sales.The CBI’s Distributive Trades Survey, which looks at retailers, wholesalers and car dealers, found that 37 per cent more retailers reported sales above their levels in January 2010 rather than below them.However, that is below the balance of 56 per cent who reported December sales higher than the previous year. The survey covered the period between January 4 and January 18.“This survey captures an interesting period for retailers, spanning the introduction of the VAT rise and price reductions during the post-Christmas sales,” said Ian McCafferty, the CBI’s chief economic adviser. The lure of seasonal sales and price discounting may have helped mitigate some of the impact of the VAT increase on volumes.”However, the survey found a smaller balance of 25 per cent of retailers expect sales over the next three months to be above levels of the previous year. And only 1 per cent of those surveyed expect to step up orders placed with wholesalers for new supplies, the smallest balance since February 2010, suggesting many do not feel that confident about future sales demand.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, pointed to the anticipated drop in orders placed with wholesalers as a possible pointer to future sales levels. It “reveals growing unease regarding the outlook for retail sales, and bodes ill for consumer spending in general, which accounts for just under half of all expenditure in the UK.” Mr Williamson noted that January 2010 was a month in which economic activity generally was blunted by harsh weather.However, some economists are now questioning the survey’s relevance to underlying actual activity. “It is hard to know what to make of this survey at present, as the gap between official retail sales data and the CBI series is enormous,” said Simon Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital.Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, noted that the survey covered what should have been the weakest sales period in January. “But it’s been out of kilter with the far weaker official and BRC measures for a few months now and we wouldn’t pay much attention to it,” she added.Taken on face value, the survey underscored the extent to which the fortunes of which retailers differ; while a balance of 70 per cent of grocers said sales volumes have risen rather than fallen, a balance of 97 per cent of specialist food and drink retailers said sales fell in January rather than rose. Also reporting strong rises were retailers of footwear and leather goods and of durable household goods.The survey of wholesalers, by contrast show a sharp rise in orders in January, with a balance of 49 per cent reporting volumes rising rather than falling when compared with the year before. Looking ahead, however, they are less optimistic with a balance of 30 per cent seeing higher, rather than lower, sales.Among wholesalers, the shift towards industrial production seems apparent. Of those selling industrial materials, 100 per cent saw sales volumes rise relative to January 2010 while among those selling building materials, 93 per cent saw sales rising rather than falling."
818;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-24T14:12:56Z;Joint venture to develop collateral message system;;A new venture is underway to make it easier to communicate collateral requirements electronically, which will be a key part of a more active market for clearing and trading over-the-counter derivatives.MarkitSERV, a joint venture of Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, has partnered with AcadiaSoft to launch a collateral messaging system in the first quarter of this year.The new service is aimed at augmenting the existing multi-venue clearing platform MarkitSERV launched last year, which connects both users and dealers of derivatives with the burgeoning number of clearing services that have emerged.Regulators are in the process of writing rules based on the Dodd-Frank bill that will detail how derivatives are to be cleared. The aim is that clearing of many contracts will reduce systemic risk stemming from underestimating derivatives exposure, which was blamed as a key domino in the credit crisis. The details are still under intense debate, however.The messaging system will relay and create an audit trail of messages on expsoures, committments and adjustments to collateral. The messages can be processed through DTCC’s trade information warehouse and regulatory reporting interface.It is likely that more detailed information about clearing and exposures will have to be handed over to regulators in the future.“Clients are searching for ways to streamline the multiple post-trade requirements,” said Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV.The streamlined processes will make it easier for traders to arrange and manage clearing themselves, without the help of manual systems through dealer desks that regulators say added risks to derivatives transactions. Many of these communications currently happen over email and telephone.Several large dealers are investors in Markit, and have also invested in clearing houses such as ICE Trust and derivatives trading platforms – set to become “swap execution facilities”, or SEFs– such as Tradeweb.
819;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-24T12:29:18Z;Germany powers eurozone services growth;;German domestic demand helped the eurozone’s economic recovery gain a stronger momentum than expected this month but inflationary pressures have also been building.Recovering further from a slow patch late last year, January’s eurozone purchasing managers’ indices released on Monday showed private sector activity expanding at its fastest in six months, with the eurozone debt crisis showing scant sign of having knocked overall growth prospects.Germany’s economy, the bloc’s largest, has been expanding at its fastest since June 2006. Its acceleration has been powered by service sector companies, which were more optimistic about the 12 months ahead than at any time in the past seven years.However, the survey also suggested that the rebound was pushing up prices – which could fuel European Central Bank fears about inflation. German manufacturers reported the fastest input price inflation since the survey began in April 1996 and were recorded as more successful than the service sector in passing on price rises.Strong growth in Germany, however, contrasted with signs of deteriorating conditions in peripheral eurozone countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which have been worst hit by the debt crisis.“The divergence between Germany and the rest of the single currency area has reached a new high,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices. Outside Germany and France, companies’ orders books were emptying and employment was falling, especially in the austerity-hit service sector, Mr Williamson said.The composite eurozone index, covering manufacturing and services and regarded as an up-to-date indicator of growth trends, rose from 55.5 in December to 56.3 in January. With a figure over 50 indicating an expansion in activity, Markit said that was consistent with eurozone gross domestic product expanding at a quarterly rate of 0.7 per cent – a substantial improvement on the 0.3 per cent GDP rise reported in the third quarter of last year. Germany’s composite index rose from 60.3 to 61.0.The results tallied with Germany’s Ifo business confidence index – which reached a record high last week – and data on eurozone industrial orders also published on Monday. These showed a 2.1 per cent jump in November compared with October, largely as the result of a 5.3 per cent increase in Germany.Underscoring Germany’s revival, Ernst & Young, the financial services firm, reported that almost three-quarters of the small and medium-sized companies in the country’s industrial Mittelstand were having difficulties finding enough qualified workers.Its survey of 3,000 enterprises put the cost of skill shortages in terms of lost revenues at almost €30bn ($41bn) a year. German business organisations have called for easier immigration rules for skilled workers to tackle the shortage.● The ECB was able to scale back its government bond buying programme last week. Purchases totalled €146m, compared with €2.3bn the previous week, according to data released on Monday.
820;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-16T22:32:41Z;Ad chiefs gloomy after cutbacks;;More marketers cut their advertising budgets than increased them in the final months of 2010, according to a survey of UK-based companies, suggesting that Britain’s media growth will lag behind the global average this year.The quarterly Bellwether report, published by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and BDO, confirms a gloomier trend among advertisers, with business confidence also dipping in the final quarter.Markit, which conducted the survey of marketing chiefs, found 22 per cent cut budgets in the last three months of 2010, compared with 17 per cent reporting a rise – the biggest downgrade for a year.Even internet spending – expected to lead the advertising recovery – saw its smallest upward revision for a year and a half.The survey comes as advertising groups’ hopes for an improvement in the global media market grow brighter, with WPP, the world’s largest by revenue, r aising its forecast at the end of last year.The survey found that UK companies expected to spend more on advertising in 2011, but the report implies a slower pace of growth compared with the US or emerging economies.Although initial budgeting for “adspend” this year is at its strongest for three years, the report says it remained “lacklustre”.“The Bellwether highlights the bumpy road of recovery that the UK economy is travelling along, and sets the scene for a difficult year ahead,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and report author.“However, it is reassuring to see that budgets have been set higher for 2011 compared to 2010, led by main media advertising.”Asked about the financial outlook for their companies, marketers’ confidence hit its lowest point for six quarters, with 32 per cent saying prospects had deteriorated, up from 27 per cent in the previous quarter.“A decline in confidence is disappointing, but characteristic of the uncertain climate,” said Rory Sutherland, IPA president.The Advertising Association reports that UK media spending grew by 6.6 per cent last year, a much better outcome than expected.GroupM, WPP’s media agency, forecast last month that global advertising spending would exceed $500bn for the first time in 2011 with growth of 5.8 per cent. The agency predicts the US will see a 3.9 per cent rise, and western Europe 2.5 per cent, compared with double-digit rises in Latin America, central and eastern Europe, and south-east Asia.
821;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-06T19:21:53Z;Eurozone default risk on the increase;Defaults more likely in western Europe;Another sign of the dwindling fortunes of the eurozone emerged this week. The economies of western Europe overtook their neighbours in central and eastern Europe as greater default risks.The event marks not just the deteriorating outlook of peripheral eurozone economies such as Portugal and Spain, but a dramatic change in fortune of countries such as Hungary and Ukraine since the financial crisis erupted in 2007.An index that measures the risk of default of 15 western European economies, including Germany, France and the peripheral eurozone countries, has surged higher than a comparable one comprised of countries such as Hungary and Ukraine. These indices, which measure the cost to insure the two geographical groups against default, suggest any hopes that the festive lull could give the eurozone a breathing space appear to be fading, only one week into the new year.Bond yields are offering similar warning signs for the eurozone.Borrowing costs, or bond yields, of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain – the highly indebted economies on the eurozone’s periphery – have all risen this week as worries that bedevilled the markets last year continue into 2011.Portugal paid high yields to borrow in the capital markets on Wednesday, prompting some analysts to warn that it is only a matter of weeks before Lisbon is forced to turn to international bail-out loans such as those offered to Greece and to Ireland.Spain, the eurozone’s fourth largest economy, will also face growing speculation that it will need bail-out loans to tackle its troubled banking sector in the event of rising bond yields.Jens Larsen, chief European economist of fixed income and currencies at RBC Capital Markets, says: “We continue to think that Portugal will face the need to go to Europe’s bailout fund unless market conditions improve significantly. If conditions deteriorate, then Spain is also at risk. In those circumstances, the European Central Bank may have to intervene in the markets on a much more significant scale than they have done so far.”By contrast, worries over central and eastern Europe’s economies are easing as countries such as Hungary, Latvia, Romania and Ukraine, which have all turned to the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance in the past two years, have made progress in addressing the imbalances and problems in their economies.This explains why Markit’s SovX Western Europe CDS index, launched in September 2009, converged for the first time with the SovX CEEMEA index, launched in January 2010. This latter index is made up of 15 countries, 11 from central and eastern Europe, and four from the Middle East and Africa.Individually, Hungary and Ukraine are deemed less risky than Ireland and Portugal, according to CDS prices, something that would have been considered unthinkable before the financial crisis when the risk that any eurozone country would default was thought to be minimal.Greek CDS prices are forecasting a more than 50 per cent chance that the country will default on its debt within the next five years, which would make it the first developed world country to default in 60 years. Hungary has only a 23 per cent chance.Critically for the eurozone periphery, the rising concern about public finances reflects the bleak outlook for their economies. This week, revised purchasing managers’ indices for December showed overall eurozone growth remaining robust at the end of 2010.But they pointed to increasingly alarming divergences in performance across the 17-country bloc.In Germany, growth is robust, powered by its industrial sector. But private sector economic activity in Spain and Ireland was contracting, with the global upturn in manufacturing offering limited relief.“The situation is getting worse, not better, in many peripheral countries and therefore governments’ financial problems are getting worse,” says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.In contrast, he says, countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland are benefiting more from Germany’s renaissance, and easing the pressure on their fiscal policies.Germany’s increasing appetite for exports from central and eastern Europe are boosting the Czech and Polish economies.For the peripheral economies, the latest data point to a likely continuation of the vicious circle, where yields or borrowing costs rise, putting strains on public finances that will then force yields even higher.In short, many analysts warn that the PMI data and the convergence of default risks between the economies in western Europe and those in central and eastern Europe suggest that the eurozone crisis will deepen rather than ease in the coming weeks.
822;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;World economy;The news is better, but daunting imbalances could bring grief;"The UK manufacturing sector is in its best shape for 16 years. More precisely, the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index in December was at the highest level since September 1994. The UK PMI was typical of an upward global economic trend; Goldman Sachs calculates that the most recent national PMI readings are consistent with a strong 4.5-5 per cent worldwide growth rate in gross domestic product.The trend during the past few months has been encouraging after almost a half-year of economic news that was, on balance, uncomfortably weak. Still, the stronger recovery needs to be set in two contexts.The first is economic: the scars of the recession still linger. Even if the good news continues (it did not last year after a similarly promising start), GDP in the eurozone, US and UK will not regain its 2008 peaks for another quarter or two. The US unemployment rate remains a disastrous 9.8 per cent, more than twice as high as the 2006 trough of 4.4 per cent. And UK manufacturing is only growing at the pace of 1994, but total output is no higher than it was early that year.The second context is financial: GDP growth would not be this strong without the aid of extensive stimulus programmes around the world. True, there are a few outposts of austerity (including the UK) and some lands where the official push is becoming less strong (much of the eurozone), but low policy interest rates and high fiscal deficits predominate.With so much money flowing, the mountain of government and financial sector leverage built up before the recession has hardly shrunk. The combination of more rapid growth and higher inflation (food and energy prices are up sharply) could now produce a healthy global deleveraging. But another combination of high debt levels and minimal or negative real interest rates makes the world vulnerable to uncontrolled inflation, speculative bubbles and sudden debt crises. This year is starting well, but could easily end badly.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
823;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-05T10:43:18Z;UK construction activity declines;;The UK construction sector contracted in December as snow and cold weather held back housebuilders, according to a closely watched index of activity.The purchasing managers index for construction registered a level of 49.1 last month, down from 51.8 in November. Any figure below 50 indicates that companies are reporting a fall in activity and December was the first month to show a decline in the sector in almost a year.The slipping activity was concentrated in the homebuilding industry, with the index for the sub-sector showing a sharper pace of decline of 43.1, down from 47.2 in November.Commercial building also slowed but continued to grow, while civil engineering activity declined slightly. Although the cold weather obstructed building, new orders continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace.Construction appears to have been experiencing a slowdown from the strong growth seen in the early summer. Employment is falling at an increasing pace – with the index for jobs declining to 45.5 last month from 46.6.Companies said that “staffing requirements continued to be assessed due to slow new order growth, with some companies indicating further redundancies”, according to Markit, the polling group which compiles the report.“Growth has been subdued in recent months, largely due to contractions in residential construction, signalling that business conditions in the sector were not conducive to a large overall expansion in activity,” said Sarah Ledger, economist at Markit.The weakness in construction underlines the risks of much slower growth in the coming quarters. Construction, although it makes up only 6 per cent of the economy, contributed a large share of the growth in the strong second and third quarters of last year.With output now close to its pre-recession peak, a stagnant housing market and sharp cuts in public sector investment to come, construction is unlikely to drive the economy forward in the near future.“The December purchasing managers survey points to contracting construction activity, which reinforces belief that the construction sector will have made nothing like the contribution to UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 that it did it in the third and second quarters,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
824;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2011-01-04T11:33:48Z;UK manufacturing ends 2010 on a high;;The UK’s manufacturing sector finished 2010 on a high with output, export orders and employment all rising rapidly, according to a closely watched survey.The purchasing managers’ index for the sector hit a new 16-year high in December reaching 58.3, up from 57.5 in November. A figure above 50 means that companies are reporting rising output.The figures suggest that the manufacturing sector grew at a strong pace in the fourth quarter of the year and shrugged off the heavy snow that hit parts of the country during December.Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, which produces the figures, said: “The UK manufacturing sector saw a truly spectacular end to 2010”.Growth in the sector appears to have recovered after a slowdown over the summer and early autumn and bodes well for hopes that the private sector will be expanding strongly enough to offset public sector austerity.Output growth was at the highest since May, while export orders are increasing at close to a record pace. Jobs growth was a little slower than the record seen in November, but still well above the long-term average. Employment has been rising for the last nine months.One dark cloud over the figures was the pace of price rises. Input prices are now rising at their highest since the PMI started in 1992, and although the prices manufacturers charge their customers are not rising quite as rapidly, inflation is not far off a series high. Markit said that companies were reporting higher prices for cotton, food products and energy.Mr Dobson said: “The hawks on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will be further unnerved by these rising price pressures”.Separate figures from the Bank of England pointed to continuing weakness in the housing market in November.Mortgage approvals remained depressed at just over 48,000, close to their average in the past six months and less than half the number of mortgages agreed on average every month in the decade before the financial crisis.Net lending to companies continued to fall and lending to households grew at a weaker pace. Both businesses and households are pushing money into reducing debt, but the damaged banking sector is both less willing and less able to lend.M4 money – which includes notes and coins in circulation, deposits and shorter-term bonds – excluding financial sector distortions rose at a 3.5 per cent annualised rate in the three months to November.That is more than earlier in the year, but still well below the 6-9 per cent pace that the Bank hoped it could achieve through its £200bn of cash injections into the economy through quantitative easing.The weakness in the money supply comes mainly through so-called intermediate financial institutions, such as pension funds and insurance companies, who seem to be reducing their holdings of cash. But household’s and companies’ deposits are showing weak growth as well, compared with historical patterns.Neville Hill, economist at Credit Suisse, said: “Broad money continued to grow slower than the MPC would like”.
825;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-20T23:27:19Z;December rally stutters amid downgrade fears;Uncertainty continues over eurozone debt;US and European stocks found it hard going to maintain their December rally against a backdrop of continued uncertainty over eurozone debt, fresh tensions on the Korean peninsular and slowing activity ahead of the holiday break.The mood of underlying caution in the markets was reflected in a strong rally for the havens of “core” government bonds and gains for the yen and precious metals.Sentiment towards the eurozone’s periphery was not helped by “serious concerns” expressed by the European Central Bank that its liquidity operations could be affected by Ireland’s bank rescue package.Further unease was sparked by talk of a possible downgrade to France’s credit rating after a series of negative ratings moves for European sovereigns last week and a cut to the senior debt ratings of two Dublin-based lenders.“Already the rating implied by trading in the insurance market for French bondholders is seven notches below its actual rating and so just three notches above junk status,” said Andrew Wilkinson, of Interactive Brokers.“With an Irish downgrade by Moody’s, along with its demotion to negative watch for Spain – and a similar fate for Belgian debt from S&P – investors are treading carefully as though another shoe was set to drop.”Eurozone peripheral government bond yields were little changed but the cost of insuring French sovereign debt against default rose to a record high – and the Markit iTraxx SovX index of Western European credit spreads widened back out towards its record high above the 200 basis point level.The fresh unease over the eurozone helped push the euro down 0.5 per cent against the dollar, although it managed to hold above the $1.31 level.The single currency also shed 0.8 per cent against the yen and hit a fresh record low against the Swiss franc.One sign that the escalating sovereign debt crisis had begun to affect the real economy came from an unexpected decline in the “flash” eurozone consumer confidence index for December, according to analysts.Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, noted that sentiment remained above its long-term average, mainly due to the brighter consumer mood in Germany, where unemployment is falling. “Stronger consumer spending in Germany provides a welcome boost to overall eurozone domestic demand,” he said.“But it will likely be insufficient to offset the drag on growth from slower external demand and the draconian austerity measures in the peripheral economies.”The fresh concerns over peripheral eurozone debt heightened demand for core government bonds, calling a halt to the sell-off seen in the past couple of weeks.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was flat at 3.33 per cent, having reached a seven-month high above 3.5 per cent last week.The yield on the 10-year German Bund was 5bp lower at 2.96 per cent and that on the 10-year UK Gilt fell 7bp to 3.48 per cent.Gold also looked increasingly attractive to investors. The price of the metal briefly rose above $1,388 a troy ounce from $1.370 on Friday, although it trimmed its advance as the session wore on. Silver followed in its wake, rising 1 per cent to $29.44.Among industrial commodities, US crude oil futures recovered from an early slide below $88 a barrel while copper pushed back towards a record high struck last week.Global equity markets put in a mixed performances.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent after recovering from early weakness while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.7 per cent to a 27-month closing peak – although it gave back much of an earlier advance.The Vix US equity volatility index closed down 0.1 per cent at 16.09.Asian stocks were mostly lower as markets fretted over further policy tightening in China and a rekindling of tensions between North and South Korea.

The mildly hostile response to latest moves of the EU’s Council of Ministers in the campaign to support weak eurozone members looks like one. The Markit index of credit default spreads on western European sovereign debt widened on Friday by 5.5 basis points to 192.5bp, close to the 203bp peak on November 30.Investors had not expected much from the politicians, and not much was what they got. Ministers agreed that the ESM will replace the ESFS and ESFM (the initials stand for some combination of European, financial, stability, stabilisation, facility and mechanism), but dodged the hard questions: how the ESM will actually work and how the Council would respond in the (likely) event of more market pressure in the two years before it starts in 2013. The leaders have put off those issues until a later date. Government bond buyers may accept the European authorities’ intellectual case – that defaults would ultimately be costlier than intra-eurozone rescues – but they fear parochial politicians would not do the right thing.Eurozone politicians have fudged and mumbled their way through this crisis. Coming from corporate leaders, such fudging would justify an aggressive market response. Still, there has been steady progress: fiscal austerity plans that were widely considered unbearable a few months ago are now installed in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Projects recently considered impossible, such as treaty revisions or eurozone bonds, are now under way or under serious consideration.Most important, investors may be underestimating the resolve and the means of the European Central Bank, which is committed both to supporting the currency and to forcing governments to behave. It announced a doubling of its capital last week to provide the required financial firepower. Investors should be giving all of this a little Christmas cheer.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
827;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Investors shun banks’ junior bonds;;Investors are shunning the junior debt of European banks as officials in Ireland and elsewhere move forward with plans to force losses on holders of riskier subordinated bonds.The spread, or gap, between the cost of protecting senior European bank debt against default and that for subordinated debt has hit its widest level since March 2009.According to the Markit iTraxx Senior/Sub Financials index, which measures credit default swap prices, the cost of insuring junior debt has risen by 14 per cent this month – compared with just 3 per cent for senior debt. It now costs €325,000 ($436,000) a year to insure €10m of bank junior bonds over five years.Spreads on risky junior debt tend to widen when markets are skittish, but analysts put the recent increase down to governments’ increased powers over troubled institutions – including greater authority to force losses on junior bondholders.Junior debt ranks above equity, but provides a cushion below senior debt. The bonds pay a higher rate of interest to compensate for the extra risk.“We don’t see this swing in the sub-senior differential correcting itself any time soon, and there is a risk it could widen further,” said John Raymond, analyst at CreditSights. “People used to think they were overcompensated for holding sub debt, but that hasn’t turned out to be true in a lot of cases.”On Tuesday, Ireland proposed legislation that would give the government wide-ranging powers over subordinated debtholders in its struggling banks, including potentially the ability to modify their interest rates, the repayment of the principal and when they might be repaid. The Dail will vote on Wednesday.Last month, Germany followed the UK and Denmark and passed legislation creating a special resolution regime that will give officials greater scope to restructure a struggling bank, including imposing haircuts on senior bondholders.
828;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-14T19:39:36Z;Food and clothing price rises lift inflation;;"Prices rose unexpectedly fast in November, driven mainly by the higher cost of staple consumer goods, official data have revealed.The consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent, more than it had for any previous November since the start of the index in 1997, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.Prices are now 3.3 per cent higher than a year ago, up from 3.2 per cent in October; economists had expected inflation to remain steady. In particular, prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages and those for clothing and footwear posted strong gains.The retail price index – an inflation measure that includes some housing costs but does not take account of consumers’ ability to switch to cheaper goods as prices rise – also increased, rising to 4.7 per cent year-on-year from 4.5 per cent in October.The stubborn persistence of inflation has confounded economists and is almost unique among developed industrial economies.Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, noted that inflation had been stronger than economists’ forecasts in 22 out of the past 32 months, and was far above the level expected by the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. A year ago, the MPC said inflation would be 1.6-1.7 per cent by now – about half what it is today.Mr Saunders said the overshoot was far bigger than it should be, even after taking account of conventional explanations such as rising prices for oil and other commodities. The persistent overshoots, coupled with the Bank’s habit of playing down rising inflation, could undermine the credibility of the inflation target in the longer term, he added.Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: “The big danger is that the temporary factors which are stoking inflation in the short run, such as higher food and clothing prices, may become entrenched in higher longer-term inflation expectations.”Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas, did not expect the MPC to make more efforts to stimulate the economy through purchases of gilts. The pace of gross domestic product growth over the past year, coupled with higher inflation than expected, cast doubt on the need for such stimulus, he said.According to the ONS, prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages drove the increases, rising 1.6 per cent during the month – the largest gain for an October to November period. Fruit prices in particular rose sharply, the ONS said.The cost of clothing and footwear also jumped at a record pace for an October-November period for November, with a 2 per cent gain month on month. The price of furniture and furnishings was the sharpest riser, up 3.7 per cent. However, falls in the prices of alcohol and tobacco, recreation and culture and health and transport helped offset the rises in other categories.One explanation for the rises in the cost of food, particularly for bread and cereals, was a weather-related jump in wheat prices, said the ONS. High grain prices fed through to strong rises in meat.The ONS said it was not clear what was causing price rises in clothes and shoes, the cost of which had fallen consistently for almost two years. There is some evidence imports may be to blame: higher oil prices make transporting goods more expensive, and there are strong pressures for higher wages in Asia.There are signs retailers are beginning to raise prices ahead of the increase in value added tax to 20 per cent in January.Also showing a sharp rise were prices for furniture, household equipment and maintenance where prices rose 1.6 per cent month on month. The largest upward effect came from furniture and furnishings, where prices rose 3.7 per cent.Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said there might be some comfort in that the main drivers of the rise in inflation were likely to be temporary, volatile factors. Core inflation, which strips these out, is unchanged at 2.7 per cent.Indeed, the ONS, in explaining the year-on-year rise in food price inflation, noted that the most notable contributors to the food price inflation came in prices for items containing wheat where recent shortages have led to record spikes on the commodities futures markets. And although fruit prices rose sharply in the month, they came nowhere near the record 11.7 per cent rise seen between October and November of 2009.“The Bank of England will undoubtedly be concerned by the November consumer price inflation data, although it will not be a major surprise to them as they forecast inflation to average 3.2 to 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter (of 2010) and to rise just above 3.5 per cent early in 2011,” Mr Archer said.“The big worry for the Bank is that rising inflation will fuel inflation expectations, although it is questionable whether that would feed through to lift wages given high unemployment.”"

830;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-09T22:31:32Z;Overview: Treasuries stage modest rebound;;Treasury bonds staged a modest rebound following the steep sell-off of the past two sessions, although the drop in US yields failed to halt a rally for the dollar against the euro as worries over peripheral eurozone debt resurfaced.High on the list of concerns were reports that Ireland’s centre-left Labour party opposition would vote against the country’s €85bn European Union/International Monetary Fund bail-out package when it is put before parliament next week.Earlier in the day, Fitch lowered Ireland’s sovereign debt rating by three notches, citing the fiscal costs of restructuring and supporting the banking system and risks to the country’s economic outlook.Ireland’s five-year credit default swap spreads, which measure the cost of insuring against a sovereign debt default, widened 11 basis points to 547 bps. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese spreads also widened.Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit, pointed to evidence of further disunity among EU leaders, notably on the subject of joint European government bonds, as a factor behind the moves in spreads.“The lack of a comprehensive approach [on “E-bonds”] is worrying for investors,” Mr Nolan said.On the currency markets, the euro sank back below the $1.32 level as the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was flat. It fell against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.Weekly US jobless claims data offered a further fillip to those in the market hoping to see economic growth gather pace following this week’s proposed tax cut extensions.Initial claims fell 17,000 last week to a fresh two-year low of 421,000 while the four-week moving average continued its downward trend.“In a week with little net new economic data, the weekly claims report takes on added significance,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities US. “As such, the December 4 claims report is another sign that the unexpectedly weak November jobs report was more likely a temporary setback in an otherwise reviving labour market.”Meanwhile, an upward revision to Japanese third-quarter GDP also boosted optimism about the prospects for the global recovery – although several analysts suggested that growth was likely to contract again in the current quarter.The mood was helped by robust jobs data out of Australia, which helped push the Aussie dollar higher against its US counterpart.US government bonds bounced, albeit relatively modestly, as bargain hunters moved in following the biggest two-day sell-off in two years.The 10-year yield fell 6bp to 3.21 per cent, with prices buoyed even further by very strong demand at a $13bn auction of 30-year paper, which saw the highest bid-to-cover ratio in four months.“There appears to be some determined buying as yield-starved investors attempt to lock in to higher rates,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The move helped push the German Bund yield down 6 bps to 2.96 per cent while, in the UK, the 10-year Gilt yield ended 7 bps lower at 3.48 per cent.The Bank of England sprang no surprises as it left interest rates unchanged at 0.5 per cent and the size of its asset purchase facility at £200bn.James Knightley, economist at ING, said: “We continue to doubt that the Bank of England will look to raise interest rates next year but acknowledge that the prospect of a second round of quantitative easing has clearly receded.“This should therefore help to provide a more supportive environment for sterling, while putting more upward pressure on gilt yields,” he said.Global equities put in broadly positive performances amid the better tone of the day’s economic releases. In New York, the S&P 500 index was up 0.4 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.4 per cent to a fresh 26-month high and the Nikkei 225 Average added 0.5 per cent to a seven-month peak.In commodities, US oil prices failed to hold $89 a barrel after a choppy session, while copper touched a record high before easing back. Gold also saw volatile trading as it edged higher.
831;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
832;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-03T11:10:43Z;UK service sector shows modest growth;;Growth in the UK services sector was modest in the first two months of the third quarter while activity in the construction sector looks set to fall, according to data published on Friday.The service sector purchasing managers’ index was little changed at 53 in November, down from 53.2 in October. That compares with a long term average of more than 55 although it is above the 50 figure that indicates companies are seeing rising activity. But it is above the growth seen in the third quarter.After the manufacturing PMI showed that growth in industry hit a 16 year high in November, the weaker figures for private sector, non-retail services is a sign that demand is less than robust in much of the domestic economy. The services PMI covers businesses that make up close to half the UK economy.The sub-index for employment fell to 48.9, indicating that companies were cutting jobs for the second month in a row, and new business growth remained modest.Markit, which produces the survey, said that companies were reducing workforces because they held excess capacity.Businesses reported that their clients were “hesitant” to agree new contracts because of the uncertain economy and worries over public sector spending cuts.Paul Smith, Markit economist, said: “The sector’s present growth profile suggests it is unlikely to generate any meaningful job creation and help to offset expected employment cuts in the public sector.“Compare this to the manufacturing sector where output is rising markedly in line with strong new export order growth and employment is being created at a record rate.“This is hardly unexpected – the service sector is naturally more exposed to internal UK demand, which continues to face severe headwinds.”Markit said the combined indices for services, construction and manufacturing, that have all been published this week point to growth of about 0.4 per cent in the final quarter of the year, compared with the third quarter’s 0.8 per cent growth.Manufacturing and trade were driving the recovery, while construction and services are being hit by weak household and investment spending, Markit said.In the construction sector, data from the Office for National Statistics showed that new orders fell by 4 per cent to £11.6bn compared with the previous quarter and were 14 per cent lower than a year earlier, driven by a sharp drop in public sector workOrders for new public sector housebuilding as well as public commercial building and largely public sector infrastructure development dropped by 25 per cent between August and September from £6.3bn to £4.7bn, somewhat offset by a near 50 per cent rise in orders for private sector housebuilding.Largely public sector orders are down by almost half in the year to the end of the third quarter – probably reflecting the government stimulus in 2009-10 and the paring back after the coalition came to power in May.After construction contributed an outsize proportion of growth in the last two quarters – in spite of making up only about 6 per cent of the economy – the weaker orders point to a slowdown in growth, or even a contraction in activity ahead.
833;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-02T01:42:19Z;MarkitSERV clears interest-rate swaps;;The universe of cleared interest-rate swaps has grown by two: MarkitSERV, an electronic trade notification platform, said on Wednesday that it had cleared rate swaps on the CME and the Singapore Exchange.MarkitSERV, co-owned by Markit and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, now connects to six clearing venues, the most of any independent platform. It has been facilitating dealer and client clearing of interest-rate swaps through LCH.Clearnet since the end of last year.The swaps on the CME involved Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities and their clients. The SGX trades were from the Development Bank of Singapore and United Overseas Bank.In recent weeks, dealers have cleared swaps directly through the exchanges. Tradeweb, a trade execution platform, has also announced clearing on the CME via its platform.The industry is still working out how most trades will be cleared. The CFTC and SEC are expected to release definitions surrounding swap execution facilities, or SEFs, next month. That will be followed by a comment period, which will enable the industry to weigh in.The clearing of a swap on the Singapore Exchange’s platform comes just weeks after SGX announced it. The CME began clearing rate swaps in mid-October.Over-the-counter swap trading volumes have been falling as the market moves toward a centrally cleared model, as mandated by Dodd-Frank bill. The interest-rate swap market, the largest derivatives market, has been stable.
834;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-01T23:10:32Z;US stocks climb sharply on economy hopes;Treasury bonds see highest yield since July;22.20 GMT: US and European stocks rose the most in three months on a combination of stronger economic data and the promise of further debt relief in Europe.China’s stronger-than-expected official purchasing managers index sparked a turnaround in Asian shares. The rallied carried into Europe, where the European Central Bank said it may unleash more firepower to support government debt markets. And it crescendoed in the US, where strong jobs and industrial data, and an optimistic survey of the economy by the Federal Reserve, lifted risk appetite across asset classes.Comments late on Tuesday by Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, that the ECB could step up its purchases of eurozone bonds were behind the moves, helped the Eurofirst 300 index jump 2.1 per cent, its best performance since September 1. Bank stocks soared 3.8 per cent, and peripheral eurozone sovereign debt yields fell sharply.Gains accelerated after positive jobs data in the US, and the US Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturing activity came in for November at just slightly below October’s, a level consistent with “a sustained period of muted economic growth”, said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Equities have been choppy, but they are still higher,” said John Brady, vice president of hedge fund sales at MF Global. “The real volatility pitfall between now and the end of the year is the income tax debate. The economic data should continue to be strong.”The S&P 500 index was up 2.2 per cent on the day, also its best one-day gain in three months. The energy sector is lead gains as oil rises more than 3 per cent, above $86 a barrel.A sell-off in bonds was sustained by the release of the Beige Book, a collection of the US Federal Reserve's anecdotal evidence of the economy, found expansion in 10 of the 12 regions it tracks. The 10-year bond yield rose currently up 17 basis points, to 2.97 per cent, its highest since July 30.Seven-year Treasuries, despite a purchase by the Fed as part of its “quantitative easing” programme, saw their highest yields since August 2, at 2.32 per cent.“If the Fed wants to solidify inflation expectations at 2 per cent, it is essentially trying to push the 10-year toward 4 per cent. The idea the market has defied the Fed is the wrong interpretation,” said Michael Dueker, head economist at Russell Investments.Earlier, Mr Trichet left open the possibility of the ECB significantly expanding its government bond purchases, warning markets not to underestimate Europe’s determination to resolve the escalating eurozone crisis. Some traders believe this could see the central bank announce an expanded bond buying remit on Thursday.The euro reached $1.3143 on its biggest one-day gain since October, buoyed further by US support for an expanded European stabilisation fund with IMF money, US officials told Reuters. The report was later denied, taking the euro and other risk assets off their high. But the single currency was still up 1.2 per cent at $1.3142, up from its 11-week low seen on Tuesday.Meanwhile, prices of “peripheral” European sovereign credit default swaps– a measure of the risks of a country default – rallied strongly on the back of Mr Trichet’s comments. Five-year CDS spreads fell 59 basis points to 485bp on Portugal and were 42bp lower on Spain trading at 323bp.Gavan Nolan, Markit analyst, said: “There’s a possibility that there might be an [ECB] announcement tomorrow and that’s triggered some short covering”.Peripheral sovereign bonds also rallied with yields on 10-year Portuguese government debt falling 30bp to 6.39 per cent. Portuguese bonds had performed almost as strongly on Tuesday as traders said the eurozone central bank had been an active buyer.On Wednesday, the positive sentiment spread to Italy with the country’s 10-year debt declining 15bp to 4.49 per cent. Spanish 10-year yields fell 19bp to 5.24 per cent. However, 10-year German Bund yields climbed 10bp to 2.78 per cent, reflecting fears that bail-out costs on core eurozone members would continue to rise.Portugal succeeded on Wednesday in getting away its €500m auction of 12-month bills with a healthy bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 times, in spite of a warning late on Tuesday by rating agency Standard & Poor’s that it could cut Portugal’s rating in the next three months if growth prospects weakened. However the 5.28 per cent yield on the issue was 47bp higher than its previous comparable auction in mid-November.Equity markets in Europe performed equally strongly. The FTSE 100 was up 2.1 per cent at 5,642. Spanish stock markets were among the biggest gainers with the Ibex 35 index rebounding 4.4 per cent, led by the country’s banks. Both BBVA and Santander climbed more than 7 per cent. Greece’s market was up 3.9 per cent, as National Bank of Greece shares rose 8.8 per cent.In Asia, stock markets were also higher with the Nikkei 225 almost recapturing the 10,000 mark, climbing 0.5 per cent to 9,988.05. Oil also climbed after China’s PMI surprise. It is now up 3.1 per cent o $86.65 a barrel.China’s Purchasing Managers Index climbed to 55.2 in November, a seven month high, helping turn around earlier losses in mainland Chinese equities. The Shanghai Composite closed up 0.1 per cent.Gold fell back from session highs to trade higher by 0.2 per cent, at $1,388 a troy ounce. It hit fresh all-time highs in euros and sterling in earlier trading of €1,070 and £895 a troy ounce respectively, before falling off slightly.
835;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-12-01T19:07:58Z;Global manufacturing powers ahead;;Global manufacturing roared ahead in November after a summer lull in activity faded away, powered by northern European countries, China and India.Manufacturing in the UK, Germany and France shrugged off the re-emerging crisis in the eurozone, according to surveys of purchasing managers published on Wednesday.Economists said the growth in northern European was particularly encouraging, indicating domestic demand was now supporting the recovery as well as the performance of exports.But faultlines were emerging between nations seeking an exit from recession as smaller Asian economies and crisis-hit peripheral European countries suffered weaker growth than their larger neighbours.The picture in Europe is divided between countries such as Spain, Greece and Ireland that are carrying out drastic austerity programmes and those such as France and Germany whose recoveries are accelerating. In the US, growth is emerging from its summer soft patch, but manufacturing activity still appears muted according to the closely watched Institute for Supply Management index.As yet the eurozone crisis shows little sign of spilling over into the larger European economies. “For the moment the momentum is holding up,” said Lavinia Santovetti, economist at Nomura.“The data highlight how domestic demand holds the key to these euro country growth divergences,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, which produces the eurozone PMIs. “Austerity measures and growing political uncertainties led to weaker domestic order book inflows, offsetting any export gains and subduing recoveries, in all cases except France and Germany.”Purchasing managers’ survey data suggests that Asia is also dividing into two economic camps as growth steams ahead in China and India, but weakens or remains relatively flat in Japan and much of emerging Asia.China’s official PMI data showed a seventh successive month of manufacturing expansion, while the unofficial HSBC Markit index also improved at the strongest pace for eight months.The robust Chinese figures suggest that demand is continuing to rise, in spite of Beijing’s attempts to slow the economy by raising interest rates and increasing the level of reserves that banks are required to hold as a way of discouraging lending.Background figures published with the two surveys suggested that output and export orders were continuing to rise, but were being outpaced by input prices, which moved up firmly.Hongbin Qu, HSBC’s chief China economist, said the more rapid rise in input prices, against the backdrop of loose monetary policy in the US, was likely to prompt further concern about inflation among Chinese policymakers.The detailed figures showed that China’s official PMI rose to a seven-month high of 55.2 in November. The unofficial HSBC China PMI rose to 55.3 from 54.8 a month earlier.The strong figures for China and India follow a sharp decline in the comparable manufacturing index for Japan, published on Tuesday. HSBC’s PMI indices for South Korea and Taiwan, published on Wednesday, suggested continuing weakness, although both indicated an improvement over October.In Europe the manufacturing PMI for the UK reached a 16 year high of 58, while revised figures for Germany and France showed similarily strong growth. However, Spanish production declined for the first time in nine months, Greek manufacturing continued to contract and Italian and Irish industry suffered weak growth.
836;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-30T22:54:27Z;Overview: Eurozone frozen in grip of contagion fears;;Persistent concerns about contagion risks in the eurozone periphery left equity and credit indices and the euro to close out the month with a negative tone as investors sought safety in gold and “core” German and US government bonds.“What little risk appetite is left in Europe appears to be dwindling as we head into year-end,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit.The pressure on peripheral sovereign debt drove the spread of Spanish and Italian government bonds over German Bunds to their widest levels since the introduction of the euro.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell 2 basis points to 2.80 per cent and the Bund yield dropped 7bp to 2.68 per cent.The Markit iTraxx SovX index, a gauge of the cost of insuring against western European sovereign debt defaults, widened above 200bp for the first time ever with the concerns over the periphery showing signs of spreading to core eurozone nations such as Belgium. Corporate credit spreads also hit multi-month wides.Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank, said there was extremely low appetite among investors to take fresh peripheral sovereign or financial exposure given current levels of uncertainty.“That’s the worrying sign for those that think that a lot of these problems are overstated,” he said. “You can have a well articulated view on why ‘x’ or ‘y’ is solvent but, if the buyers have completely dried up because of all the fear and uncertainty, then micro analysis becomes secondary.”On the currency markets, the euro sank below $1.30 to its lowest level for 11 weeks as risk aversion bolstered the dollar, the yen and the Swiss franc.“Euro/dollar’s 200-day moving average at $1.3129 has given way for the first time since January and though we don’t foresee this leading to another 17 per cent drop in the pair as it did back then, this is certainly a fearful short-term trading signal,” warned Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital.John Higgins, of Capital Economics, said there were three main reasons to expect the euro to fall to parity with the dollar at some point next year.“First, the Federal Reserve’s decision to undertake further quantitative easing will probably come to be seen by investors as the right thing to have done to support the US economy.“Second, fears of the eurozone breaking up are likely to intensify – and third, expectations of tighter European Central Bank policy should be scaled back as the eurozone’s economic recovery peters out.”Indeed, many in the markets suggested the ECB might be poised to increase its purchases of eurozone government bonds significantly in an attempt to defuse the crisis.“A ‘muddle through’ option could involve the ECB announcing a ‘shock and awe’ amount of quantitative easing to hoover up a significant part of government issuance,” said Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities. “With the ECB expected to scale back extraordinary measures at this week’s meeting, such an option would require the sharpest of U-turns but might well be the most flexible and easy to implement in the short-run.”But Mr Jenkins also warned more radical action might be necessary. “If bond yields keep rising like this, then we may see a much faster move towards a de facto fiscal union with a central debt management office and a single European government bond, possibly under the auspices of the European Financial Stability Facility initially.”Global equities ended the month on the back foot. New York’s S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, helped some by news that President Barack Obama was opening negotiations with Republicans on tax cuts. The index was heading for a flat finish for November as a whole.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 eased 0.2 per cent for a November drop of 1.6 per cent, its first monthly decline since August. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo tumbled 1.9 per cent but recorded a hefty 8 per cent gain for November.In commodities, gold was just short of its 2 week high at $1,385 an ounce, and reached a nominal record in euro terms. Oil drifted back near $84 a barrel but copper touched a one-week high.
837;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Relief at Ireland bail-out proves short lived;;The euro dipped to a two-month low, peripheral eurozone government bonds stayed under pressure and equities on both sides of the Atlantic suffered hefty sell-offs as the latest moves by European policymakers to ease the region’s debt crisis failed to calm market jitters.EU finance ministers on Sunday agreed an €85bn ($111bn) bail-out for Ireland and approved the outlines of a permanent mechanism to deal with future debt crises.The European Commission was adamant that senior holders of Irish debt would not be forced to accept losses.But any sense of relief among investors proved short-lived. On the currency markets, the euro briefly pushed above $1.33 before turning tail and sliding beneath $1.31 to its lowest level since mid-September.Irish government bonds also reversed an initial rise while contagion fears drove the costs of insuring against a sovereign default by Spain and Portugal – as measured by their sovereign credit default swap spreads – to record levels.The Markit iTraxx index of senior European financial CDS ended unchanged at 165 basis points after widening sharply last week.“Today proved just how ineffectual the Irish bail-out is as investors continued to fret over the risk of other European states that are likely to require similar treatment,” said Angus Campbell, of Capital Spreads. “There’s a real fear now that the balance has well and truly tipped against Portugal and Spain, who look increasingly more like suffering a similar fate to Greece and Ireland despite their protestations to the contrary.”There was a growing view that some EU ministers were urging Portugal to follow Ireland in accepting a bail-out in the belief that such a move might keep contagion from spreading to its Iberian neighbour.But Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, suggested that the most likely consequence of a rapidly executed Portuguese bail-out would be to hasten a Spanish crisis, not slow its progress.“If a third member were rescued without fuss, it would heighten the market’s sense that bail-outs had become commonplace and that, maybe, several more support packages might be in the offing,” he said. There were worrying signs that the markets were looking even further afield to identify those countries that may require help in the future.The premium demanded by investors to hold Italian rather than German debt reached the highest since the introduction of the euro as yields jumped at an auction of the country’s bonds. Belgium’s 10-year yield reached the highest level in nine months.The deterioration in risk appetite spread to US and European equity markets – in spite of signs that shoppers had been out in force over the Thanksgiving day holiday.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.14 per cent as the Vix equity volatility index – watched as a broad measure of risk aversion – jumped 5 per cent to trade above 23, its highest point since early October.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.6 per cent to a seven-week closing low as bank stocks came under renewed pressure.Asian markets enjoyed a stronger session with the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rising 0.9 per cent to a five-month high and Hong Kong rebounding 1.3 per cent from an eight-week low. The weakness for US and European stocks offered some support to US Treasury bonds with the yield on the 10-year note down 3bp at 2.84 per cent. The German Bund yield, by contrast, added 2bp to 2.76 per cent.Commodities had a more mixed session. US oil futures pushed back above $85 a barrel as freezing weather hit western Europe, although copper reversed an early rise as the dollar advanced. Gold held steady at $1.366 a troy ounce.Away from the eurozone periphery, Hungary wrong-footed market participants by raising interest rates 25bp to 5.5 per cent – after holding them at a record low for six months.But the forint currency fell sharply amid concerns that political tension between the central bank and Hungary’s government could have triggered the move.
838;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Attack by North Korea triggers flight to safety;Risk sentiment suffers serious deterioration;Risk sentiment suffered a serious deterioration as North Korea’s bombardment of a South Korean island added a fresh layer of uncertainty to markets already burdened with concerns about eurozone debt and the tightening of Chinese policy.Global equities, commodities and the euro came under heavy selling pressure as investors sought safety in the dollar and the “core” government bonds of the US, Germany and the UK. Gold also rose, in spite of the dollar’s firmer tone.“The market mood has darkened considerably as a cluster of headwind factors have resurrected fears about a fragile global financial system, outweighing the positive signals from economic figures that point to a continued expansion,” said Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon.News of the sudden escalation of tensions in the Korean peninsular came too late to have much immediate impact on Seoul’s stock market but left the Won currency sharply lower against the dollar.Analysts said the markets would remain sensitive to further developments in the region but the general view was that the situation would most likely be limited to “sabre-rattling”.“Despite the increasingly erratic behaviour of the North Korean regime, we still view a full-blown war between the two Koreas as only a remote possibility,” said Flemming Nielsen, senior analyst at Danske Bank. “The incident’s impact on the financial markets is likely to prove temporary.”Meanwhile, mounting concerns that Ireland’s debt crisis could yet spread to other eurozone nations continued to weigh on the euro and on peripheral government bonds.“The speed at which the European markets fell back into fearing sovereign and banking risks after Ireland agreed to a bail-out by its EU partners is a worry,” said Greg Gibbs, FX strategist at RBS.The single currency sank more than two cents to trade below $1.34, its weakest level since September.The yield spread between Irish and German 10-year government bonds widened 45 basis points to 589bp, while the five-year Irish credit default swap spread, a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign debt default, soared 46bp to 578bp, according to Markit.Portugal, widely seen as next in the market’s line of fire, saw its spreads approach 500bp with concerns heightened by news that the country’s budget deficit had widened in the first 10 months of 2010, in spite of higher tax revenues.Significantly, the Spanish-German 10-year spread widened to its highest level since the introduction of the euro.An auction of short-dated Spanish Treasury bills produced less than impressive results, with yields rising sharply.Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets, highlighted growing concerns about Spain’s banking system.“These concerns had subsided following the European [bank] stress tests in July but have made a comeback as the bail-out for Irish banks confirms that the stress tests were not stressful enough,” he said.The intensification of geopolitical and sovereign debt worries prompted a sharp sell-off in global equities.The S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was also 1.5 per cent lower.In Seoul, the Kospi index ended with a loss of 0.8 per cent but after-hours index futures tumbled and Hong Kong shed 2.7 per cent, its biggest drop in six months. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.The flight from risk triggered broad gains for core government bonds, with the 10-year US Treasury yield down 4bp to 2.76 per cent and the German Bund yield 11bp lower at 2.55 per cent.In commodities, oil recovered the $81 a barrel level but was still down, while copper neared a one-week low. Gold climbed to just above $1,375 an ounce.There was little market response to the day’s main economic releases. US third-quarter growth was revised up to an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent from 2 per cent. The Federal Reserve’s open market committee minutes stressed that its easing programme would not be tied to economic data.The eurozone purchasing managers’ indices came in stronger than expected, flagging a solid re-acceleration in both factory and services activity.
839;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-23T11:36:37Z;Germany drives eurozone rebound;;Germany has powered a marked revival in eurozone economic activity this month, according to a closely-watched indicator that showed the recovery was far from being blown-off course by the crisis in Ireland.The eurozone purchasing managers’ index, covering both manufacturing and services, rose unexpectedly strongly from 53.8 in October to 55.4 in November, reversing falls in previous months which had pointed to a slowdown in activity.Significantly, a record pace of job creation in German manufacturing shown by the survey could boost hopes of a lasting pick-up in consumer spending in Europe’s largest economy – which in turn would help ease so-called global economic “imbalances”.The results suggested the recovery in continental Europe’s largest economies had become more self-sustaining – offering possible relief for countries such as Ireland, Portugal and Greece, which have been worst hit by the crisis over public finances.They indicated the recovery could “move to a more mature, sustainable phase”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey. But he warned that the upturn remained exceptionally unbalanced, with growth beyond France and Germany “stagnating at best”.Eurozone growth prospects in coming months are expected to be hit by fiscal austerity measures planned by governments across the continent – although the recent weakness of the euro could provide an offsetting boost to exports.The purchasing managers survey stated that in Germany, job growth in manufacturing was the fastest since the survey began in 1996. In a clear sign that tumbling unemployment was feeding through into more spending in German high streets, the country’s statistics office reported separately that consumer spending had risen by 0.4 per cent in the three months to September – the third consecutive quarterly increase.France also saw a significant pick-up in economic activity this month, with its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index hitting 57.5 after 55.2 in October, the highest in ten years. A figure above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The results came as the European Central Bank prepared to unveil next week the latest steps in its “exit strategy” to unwind emergency measures taken to support the eurozone finance system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008.So far the crisis in Ireland, which accounts for less than 2 per cent of eurozone GDP, appears to have had little impact beyond the country’s borders. Eurozone GDP in the fourth quarter was on track to increase at a pace similar to the 0.4 per cent expansion seen in the third quarter, economists said. But ECB policymakers will remain wary of weaknesses in other eurozone “peripheral” countries, such as Portugal, and in the German banking system.
840;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-16T22:38:00Z;Equities sold off amid broad flight to safety;A toxic cocktail of lingering fears hit equities;"Financial markets had a very uncomfortable session as a toxic cocktail of lingering fears over eurozone debt, concerns about Chinese policy tightening and doubts about the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing triggered a broad flight from risk.Global equities, commodities and high-yielding currencies ran into heavy selling pressure, while US Treasury bonds recouped some of their recent losses and the trade-weighted dollar index climbed to its highest level since the start of October. Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets, said the fact that the dollar index had closed on Monday above its October highs suggested the correction in the US currency had further to run.“This in turn will make room for a further unwind of the ‘risk-on’ trade, given the correlation that has been seen with regards to the dollar and risk,” he said.The euro continued to lose ground against the dollar – touching a seven-week low – as the markets watched intently for any signs that Ireland might bow to pressure to accept some form of international bail-out to resolve its fiscal crisis. A robust reading on the German Zew index of business sentiment went largely unheeded.Ireland has repeatedly emphasised that it remains fully funded until next summer – although analysts have noted that it could use European Union funds to shore up its vulnerable banking system.“That would be an elegant solution for the government in Dublin; if they pretend that the bail-out was not really about the fiscal situation but about saving the banks, the government would be able to apply for the rescue package without suffering excessively domestically,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank.Nevertheless, doubts that an agreement would be reached sent Irish government bonds lower for the first day in three. The 10-year Irish-German yield spread widened 21 basis points to 561bp, while Ireland’s five-year credit default swaps, a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign default, widened 33bp to 530bp.But Greek CDS blew out a hefty 97bp to 950bp, according to Markit data, after a report that Austria was considering withholding a €190m tranche of assistance to Greece, citing the country’s failure to meet tax revenue targets. The report was denied by Austria’s finance ministry.“Without the disbursement of funds from the EU, Greece would struggle to fund itself,” said Gavan Nolan at Markit.Meanwhile, US Treasury bonds rebounded from a recent sell-off as Federal Reserve officials moved to counter recent criticism of the central bank’s expansion of its quantitative easing policy.A group of prominent Republican-leaning economists has launched a campaign urging the Fed to end its asset purchase plan.Tame US producer price data on Tuesday appeared to lend weight to the Fed’s dismissal of claims that QE could ignite inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury – which had soared as much as 50bp following the Fed’s QE2 confirmation – was down 12bp to 2.83 per cent, nearly erasing a sharp rise in yields on Monday.The better tone to Treasury bond prices and the dollar came as global equities took a severe beating.The sell-off started in Asia, where the Shanghai Composite index tumbled 4 per cent – following on from Friday’s 5 per cent drop – as rumours of aggressive action by the authorities to control inflation spooked the market.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average backed away from an intraday five-month high to close 0.3 per cent lower.The negative mood spilled over to Europe, where the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 2.3 per cent, its worst one-day fall since July. The S&P 500 index closed down 1.6 per cent as the market shrugged off positive earnings and comments from leading retail groups.Commodity prices also suffered significant losses as last week’s sell-off resumed. The Reuters- efferies CRB index of raw materials hit a three-week low, as US crude oil fell more than $2.50 a barrel to below $83 and copper retreated further from last week’s record high. Gold touched a two-week low of $1,329 an ounce."
841;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Unease lingers over eurozone sovereign debt;Markets watch for signs Ireland might accept aid;Peripheral eurozone debt concerns remained in the spotlight as the markets continued to watch for signs that Ireland’s government was moving closer to accepting aid to resolve its fiscal crisis.There was also a renewed focus on the US bond market as 10-year Treasury yields hit a three-month high amid mounting opposition among Republicans to the Federal Reserve’s second round of quantitative easing.But it was Dublin, Lisbon and Athens, rather than Washington, that generated most of the headlines as speculation remained rife that Ireland was on the point of requesting financial help from the European Union.“The bail-out for Ireland that many expected to be announced over the weekend didn’t materialise, though it was acknowledged for the first time that talks had taken place,” said Gavan Nolan, credit strategist at Markit.“Ireland’s government offered a public show of resistance, stating that it will stand alone. However, reports suggest that a decision could be reached at a meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday.”This speculation helped narrow the yield spread between Irish 10-year government bonds and German Bunds to 539 basis points, the lowest for a week. Five-year Irish credit default swaps, a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign default, narrowed 45bp to 495bp, according to Markit.But on the currency markets, the sense of unease over the eurozone debt crisis helped drive the euro to below $1.36 to a six-week low.Portugal’s finance minister warned that the growing danger of contagion in financial markets had increased the risk his country would be forced to seek international assistance.Further bad news came as Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, said Greece’s 2010 budget deficit and public debt would be significantly higher than forecast.Across the Atlantic, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose 16p to 2.95 per cent – the highest since early August – after reports that a group of economists and former government officials had called on the Federal Reserve to halt its programme of bond purchases.The 10-year yield touched a low of 2.46 per cent shortly after the US central bank announced its latest move.“The driving force behind the rise in yields has been an increase in the market’s inflation expectations on the back of the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy,” said Peter Possing Andersen, senior analyst at Danske Bank.“Furthermore, US economic data have come in better than expected and the reporting season has proved robust.” Indeed, data released on Monday showed that headline US retail sales rose by 1.2 per cent in October – the biggest increase in seven months – bolstered by a 5 per cent increase in purchases of cars.Excluding autos and gas, and building materials, “core” sales rose 0.2 per cent, in line with forecasts.“Today’s number is welcome news and will probably result in higher expectations for what is shaping up to be the first solid holiday shopping season in three years,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.However, a report on manufacturing activity in the New York region was significantly weaker than expected. The New York Fed’s “Empire State” index fell to minus 11.14 in November from plus 15.73.European equity markets were content to focus on the sales data, but the S&P 500 index in New York closed 0.1 per cent lower, falling as Treasury yields jumped.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.8 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.1 per cent while the Shanghai Composite added 1 per cent as both markets bounced back from a sharp sell-off at the end of last week.The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodities index rose 0.8 per cent, its first rise in four days, as copper and softs rose. But oil fell below $85 a barrel and gold slipped $12 to around $1,356 an ounce, a day after recording its biggest fall for four months. Copper edged up 0.1 per cent but was still down 4 per cent from Thursday’s nominal record high of $8,966 a tonne.
842;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-11T22:49:21Z;Overview: Irish woes feed EU contagion fears;;Eurozone debt woes dominated the market agenda as concerns intensified that Ireland might soon be forced to follow Greece in turning to international financial support.Across the Atlantic, US stocks fell as a bleak outlook from Cisco Systems triggered a sell-off in the technology sector, while the price of copper reached a record high as robust activity data from China bolstered optimism about global growth.But the key focus in the markets remained the relentless rise in peripheral eurozone government bond yields, which helped drive the euro beneath $1.37 to a five-week low on the currency markets.Highlighting the tensions surrounding the region, Don Smith at Icap Europe said liquidity in the euro swap market had “dropped off a cliff” this week, with trading conditions turning extremely volatile.“It’s quite a while since we’ve seen an environment like this,” he said. “There is an ominous scent in the air of an impending ‘event’.”The yield on the Irish 10-year government bond jumped 27 basis points to 8.90 per cent, taking its spread over the German Bund yield to a post-euro record of 647bp, according to Bloomberg data. Five-year Irish credit default swaps, a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign default, rose 12bp to a record 609bp, according to Markit data.“Irish yields are now well above both the levels faced by Greece just before it was bailed out in the spring and the rates at which it might receive funds from the European Financial Stability Facility,” said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics.“Admittedly, Ireland reportedly has enough funds to last it until next summer. But should yields continue to rise, the pressure will surely mount for it to accept the inevitable and seek help well before then.”Indeed, some in the markets felt the level of Irish 10-year spreads and CDS prices suggested a bail-out of the country could be just a matter of weeks away. “This could be sooner should European policymakers feel the need to pre-emptively avoid a total exclusion of Ireland from funding in the bond markets as has occurred to Greece,” said Divyang Shah at IFR Markets.Meanwhile, there were growing concerns about the risk of contagion from Ireland and Portugal to Spain. These were heightened by news that the Spanish economy had stalled in the third quarter of the year as austerity measures aimed at cutting the country’s fiscal deficit kicked in.“Spain’s recovery from the 2008-09 recession has been painfully slow and there is a real prospect of double-dip in the Iberian nation,” said Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com. “Although its financing problems are considered less urgent than those in Ireland and Portugal, persistent pressure on Spanish bond yields may be the canary in the coal mine for the single currency as Spain makes up about 10 per cent of the eurozone’s economic output.”The yield spread on 10-year Spanish bonds over German Bunds climbed 12bp to 218bp and at one point was at a record high.However, eurozone debt concerns had only muted impact on European equity indices – in spite of sharp losses for Irish bank stocks. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended just a fraction lower, while Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax inched higher.On Wall Street, Cisco Systems’ shares tumbled 16 per cent, helping to drive the S&P 500 down 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.9 per cent lower.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.3 per cent to its highest level for more than four months, while Shanghai was lifted by a batch of Chinese economic data, including industrial production figures, that pointed to continued economic growth.The markets appeared relatively unperturbed by news that Chinese inflation had jumped to the highest for more than two years, stoking expectations for further monetary tightening.Indeed, copper led a broad rally in commodity prices as it climbed to a record high of $8,966 a tonne. Oil was flat after rising more than $1 a barrel on Wednesday, while gold regained the $1,400 an ounce level but pulled back from early highs.
843;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-03T11:15:58Z;Services sector sustains growth momentum;;The services sector saw an increase in growth in October for the second month in a row, indicating that the economy got off to a reasonable start in the final quarter of the year.Private sector services, which make up nearly half the UK economy, grew at a reasonable pace in the third quarter and the figures on Wednesday from Markit’s purchasing managers index for the sector suggest that the picture was if anything slightly brighter in the first month of the fourth quarter.The PMI for services nudged up to 53.2 from 52.8 in September, better than the third quarter average of 52.4. Any figure above 50 indicates that companies are reporting an increase in business activity. The index has fallen from a peak of 58.4 in February, however, suggesting significantly slower growth.The figures follow an improvement in manufacturing sector PMI in October, and a decline in construction growth. Overall, the three measures point to higher activity across the economy in October than in the prior month.“Rates of expansion remain soft compared to long-run averages, as companies continue to digest the true effects on the economy of the coalition government’s Comprehensive Spending Review,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit.Although this year has seen strong growth across the economy, many economists fear that some of its foundations are shaky, notably an unsustainable rise in construction output and support from government spending that is unlikely to last.But the government hopes that private sector growth will offset the cuts in public spending, and figures for the final quarter of the year suggest that private businesses outside of construction are performing relatively well.“It still looks like, while the recovery has slowed, the economy is in no imminent danger of a double-dip – further reducing the chances that the MPC announces any extra QE at tomorrow’s meeting,” said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics.One key question is whether private sector growth will sustain its momentum into next year after January’s hike in VAT, which is expected to eat into consumer spending, and when the cuts begin to bite with the onset of the next fiscal year in April.New business improved in the service sector in October, but employment fell slightly, while prices charged rose at the fastest pace in more than two years.Business expectations are well below their long-term average, and within the range that the survey recorded during the recession, probably reflecting uncertainty and fears about the impact of the cuts.“Whilst the private sector has been set the task of picking up the pieces and making up the shortfall of job losses in the public sector, it’s hard to tell at this point where the necessary demand and new contracts will come from to make this happen,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, which sponsors the figures.
844;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-02T11:58:00Z;Eurozone manufacturing picks up in October;;Eurozone manufacturing growth picked up faster than previously thought last month, adding to evidence of a global rebound in industrial activity.Upward revisions for purchasing managers’ indices suggested a stronger euro has had little impact so far on manufacturing activity in the 16-country region and that the expected slowdown in eurozone economic growth may not be as severe as feared.Prospects appeared also to have brightened in Spain and Ireland, two of the eurozone countries worst hit by this year’s crisis over public finances – although Greek manufacturing contracted at a faster rate.The results came as the European Central Bank prepares for Thursday’s interest-rate setting meeting, when it is expected to reaffirm its gradual “exit strategy” to unwind emergency measures taken to support the economy after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to unveil fresh “quantitative easing” measures.The latest purchasing managers’ indices provided “much needed reassurance that manufacturing remains an important driver of the euro area recovery,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey. Together with data earlier this week on Chinese, US and UK manufacturing activity, they “suggest that manufacturing activity globally is re-accelerating,” added Ken Wattret at BNP Paribas.At 54.6 in October, the eurozone index was significantly higher than September’s reading of 53.7. It was also above the original “flash” estimate of 54.1, suggesting much of the improvement had come later in the month, boosted by export sales. A figure higher than 50 indicates an expansion in activity.However, October’s index was still down sharply from the peak of 57.6 hit in April, which was then the highest reading for almost four years. That showed how “the recovery has moved down a gear,” said Mr Williamson. The latest readings were consistent with eurozone manufacturing expanding at an annual rate of 3 per cent to 4 per cent, down from almost 10 per cent in April.Details of the survey showed the manufacturing upswing being powered by Germany, which saw its purchasing managers’ index reach 56.6. But the upswing was also broadening. Readings for Spain and Ireland had dipped below 50 in September but rose back above that threshold in October.Greece’s index, however, sank to 43.6 in October, from 44.7 in September. That largely reflected the impact of a lorry drivers’ strike on orders and Markit warned that disruptions and uncertainty in the country would continue to undermine manufacturing activity.
845;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-11-01T11:37:56Z;Manufacturers report accelerated growth;;The UK manufacturing sector saw an accelerated pace of growth at the beginning of the fourth quarter for the first time in six months, according to a closely watched index.The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose from a level of 53.52 in September to 54.93 in October , with a figure above 50 indicating that companies are reporting increased activity. The survey also indicated the strongest boost to employment on record.Growth in manufacturing as measured by the PMI had been slowing since June and although the series is quite volatile from month-to-month, the pick up in October will raise hopes that the sector will continue to provide a lift to the economy in the fourth quarter.Another recent business survey of manufacturing by the CBI suggested that although growth slowed during the third quarter, the slowdown was not profound nor expected to deepen. Retail surveys suggest that the fourth quarter kicked off on the high street at a similar pace to growth seen at the end of the third quarter.The limited picture available so far suggests the economy in the fourth quarter started off at a decent pace of growth after its surprising strong expansion in the last two quarters.The PMI survey indicated that in addition to faster growth in activity, employment growth accelerated, with the sub-index for jobs rising from 48.97 to 54.97. That is close to the fastest rate of job creation since 1995 and bodes well for hopes that the recent rapid rises in employment across the economy may continue.The figures “will provide reassurance that manufacturing remained a driver of UK economic growth at the start of the final quarter,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, which produces the data.Increased output of intermediate goods – the materials and parts used to make other manufactured products – was particularly strong, while consumer and capital goods production grew less quickly. Intermediate goods producers increased employment sharply as a result and built up their stocks of goods – a factor that may also boost growth in the fourth quarter.Ross Walker of Royal Bank of Scotland said that the PMI measure of output correlated with about 2.5 per cent annualised growth in official manufacturing output data – well above its long term trend, albeit after the sector suffered a deep recession.The figures add to the sense that it will be hard for the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to justify additional monetary easing at its meeting on Thursday, even if some members of the committee believe that the current expansion in the economy cannot be maintained and that another injection of quantitative easing may be needed.
846;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Weighing up the value of fixed income bonds;;With investors looking for low-risk investments and concentrating harder on keeping costs down, passive fixed income investments seem like a no-brainer, especially as it is now almost a truism that it is difficult to add value as an active bond manager.However, closer inspection reveals a number of problems with passive fixed income investment, mostly to do with the choice, construction and use of indices.Traditionally bond indices, like their equity counterparts, have been cap-weighted, with those issuers with the largest amount of debt outstanding taking up most weight on the index. But this is a problem. Although it is possible a company has more debt than its sectoral peers because it is bigger, it might equally imply the company has more debt to equity, not necessarily an attraction for investors.Recently there have been a number of attempts to solve or at least mitigate this problem. The Pimco Gladi family of indices weights international bonds by the gross domestic product of their respective countries of issue, so at least the economic environment where the issuers do business is reflected in the index.Research Affiliates, the company which pioneered the fundamental weightings principle for equity indices, whereby constituents are weighted according to metrics other than market capitalisation, has also brought a set of exchange traded funds based on fundamentally weighted bond indices to the market.The Rafi US corporate bond indices are calculated by Ryan ALM, a company specialising in solving the various problems of fixed income benchmarks.The issue of how to weight the various constituents of an index is just one of many such problems. Equity indices are relatively easily constructed because their components are traded on exchanges, with price discovery just a question of linking to the exchange. Bonds, on the other hand, are over-the-counter instruments, so finding out the indicative price of each security is a hit-or-miss affair.For this reason, bond indices have traditionally been the preserve of investment banks, which can see the prices at which their clients are trading bonds. This has two disadvantages: the banks rely on a single pricing source (their own trading desks) and there are inevitable conflicts of interest between the index business and the trading floors. Although such conflicts can of course be managed, investors are now less comfortable with this situation than they used to be.This is where Markit’s iBoxx indices come in – Markit bases its indices on averages of prices sourced from a number of investment banks, making it in theory more representative of the market and more independent.Unfortunately, Markit then runs into the problem that has deterred traditional equity index providers from entering the fixed- income world: it is expensive to source this information.MSCI Barra, for example, withdrew from the fixed income index business when it found it could not compete on price with the investment banks that could source the information for free and offset any costs against revenue from other parts of the business.So investors need to weigh the benefits of independence against the cost – in many cases, the latter will outweigh the former and investment bank indices will look the most attractive.Another issue is that historically many of the fixed income indices from investment banks were developed for a specific, internal purpose, such as measuring performance of a particular portfolio. This may mean an index is not particularly appropriate for an investor’s purposes or that it is simply not tradeable.An index is said to be tradeable if it is possible to trade all its constituents at the price implied by the index – not necessarily practicable in the case of an aggregate index that may have more than 1,000 constituents, or where some constituents are illiquid.In the case of some securities, the investors who bought most of a bond issue may plan to hold it to maturity, which will make it particularly difficult to trade at a price commensurate with its market-implied price.For the first bond ETFs, providers used specially designed liquid or compact indices in order to be able to trade the index freely without too large a gap appearing between the value of the index and the price paid for the ETF (the bid-offer spread).Since then, two alternative approaches have been developed to overcome the problem of difficult-to-trade indices: partial replication and synthetic replication.Partial replication involves working out a representative sample of the bonds in the index and buying just those, which carries the risk of tracking error arising if the sample turns out not to be representative.Synthetic replication involves using derivatives to reproduce the index returns. Although this is widely used in Europe, where Ucits funds can use derivatives, it is less popular in the US, where it would put the ETF using it outside the mutual fund pigeonhole. It also relies on the availability and liquidity of derivatives (futures or swaps) on the relevant index.One final surprise for many innocent investors who thought passive bond investing was a straightforward game is that many indices will include a broad variety of instruments, including interest rate swaps and asset-backed securities.While there may be nothing wrong with investing in these instruments, it is important for investors to understand what is in their portfolios and what risks they are facing.

848;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-10-17T23:01:52Z;Government cuts shadow over ad market;;Cuts to the government’s advertising budget have deepened substantially since the summer as UK marketers put their plans on hold ahead of this week’s comprehensive spending review.The Cabinet Office said in August that the government had halved its spending on advertising and marketing since freezing all but a few “essential” communications in July.Since then, several advertising agencies have told the Financial Times that government spending has fallen by about three-quarters compared with the same period last year.With a total marketing budget of more than £500m last year, the government has been the UK’s biggest advertiser. It spent about £200m buying media space on TV, radio, newspapers, websites and posters in the year to March.The latest IPA/BDO Bellwether survey, published on Monday, provides only modest cheer for media owners and agencies.The third quarter saw a “marginal” 0.5 per cent aggregate increase in companies’ marketing budgets, with as many cutting as raising their ad spend.A short-lived increase in the first quarter’s Bellwether was followed by a reduction in the second, since when little has changed, the latest survey found.In a positive indicator for broadcasters and publishers, companies increased their investment in media-buying by the greatest amount for three years, as many cut back sales promotions and discounts. But Markit Economics, the report’s compiler, also found that companies were becoming less confident about their prospects.“It’s a wait-and-see mode that companies are in at the moment,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “The government is such a big advertiser that it will drag down the market.”As part of its cost-saving drive, the Cabinet Office has discussed running public service announcements on the BBC, instead of paying commercial broadcasters, such as ITV, for airtime.“Publicly funded channels such as government websites currently carry limited public service messages and we are keen to explore opportunities to do things differently and save money for the taxpayer,” the Cabinet Office said. “As part of this, we are having discussions with the BBC on the census.”The BBC’s governing body has argued against the Cabinet Office’s proposal. “While the [licence fee] agreement sets out the BBC’s role in providing public information in emergencies, and the BBC may cover government activity in its programming, it is for the BBC alone to decide what it broadcasts and when,” said the BBC Trust.Any change to this arrangement, it added, “would have serious implications for the corporation’s independence and impartiality”. In addition, the trust warned, if the BBC were to broadcast free-of-charge advertising content that could otherwise appear on commercial channels “that would be likely to have an adverse impact on the wider market”.Ad agencies expect the government’s austerity to continue until mid-2011.“Most estimates are that they have cut spend by 75 to 80 per cent,” said David Kershaw, chief executive of M&C Saatchi.In its review of public bodies last week, the Cabinet Office raised the prospect that the Central Office of Information, which handles many departments’ marketing, could itself be scrapped, after putting it “under review”.Mark Lund, chief executive of the COI, said that it was already reducing its workforce by 40 per cent.In spite of the cuts and the gloomy outlook, many analysts are still expecting total advertising spending to rise in the UK this year, after a strong first half.
849;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
850;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-10-05T16:22:01Z;Employers fear recovery is at risk;;The economy grew at a reasonable pace in the third quarter but businesses are increasingly alarmed about the prospects for another recession or much weaker growth, according to a closely watched survey of companies.Growth between July and September looks likely to have been 0.4 to 0.5 per cent, according to polling company Markit, an estimate based on its surveys of purchasing managers in the service, manufacturing and construction sectors.That is not far from the 0.6 per cent long-run average pace at which the UK has grown, but it is much slower than the 1.2 per cent growth in the second quarter. Markit warned that many companies are worried about spending cuts, with greater detail on the austerity measures due later this month in the government’s spending review.“There are widespread worries that the economy is losing steam rapidly and that the recovery is at risk,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “Orders are not coming through at anything like their pace before and public sector contracts are being cut. Businesses believe these cuts are arriving at the wrong time.”But Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI employers’ group, said companies he spoke to supported the cuts.“There is more uncertainty around than in the second quarter, but businesses still want the government to get on with it,” he said.The evidence of business fears came as Markit published its combined index of activity in services, manufacturing and construction which rose to a level of 53.2 in September, up from 52.3 in August, although still below its long-term average and well down on earlier this year. A figure above 50 indicates that companies are reporting growth.Services sector data published on Tuesday showed weak business confidence and new orders rising at the slowest pace in 15 months, though overall activity rose to 52.8 from 51.3.Earlier figures showed a slight improvement in construction and little change in . Manufacturing has slowed down significantly from earlier in the year, however, and the purchasing managers’ index is now little above its long-run average, a level consistent with no growth.Meanwhile, Mr Williamson says that “construction is expecting an armageddon” after a huge second quarter expansion, and growth in business investment had disappeared in the third quarter.Other data measures have been less clear that the economy is slowing - data from the CBI and the EEF engineers group suggest that manufacturing has performed well in recent months, while retail sales data have been extremely strong. Employment was growing early in the second quarter, although more people were claiming unemployment benefits.On Thursday, the Bank of England announces its latest decision on interest rates and quantitative easing, after signs have emerged that further stimulus is under discussion within its monetary policy committee. Adam Posen last week became the first member of committee to call for a fresh round of quantitative easing, arguing that the outlook for growth was weak. But no action is expected until the Bank’s next forecasts are available in November.
851;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;UK manufacturing activity falters;;"UK manufacturing activity was weaker than expected in September, according to a closely watched survey, and export orders fell to their lowest level since July 2009 as recovery was getting under way.Markit noted that the overall rate of expansion, while positive, is the weakest since September 2009 and well below the 15-year high seen in March.The Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey of purchasing managers saw its headline reading slip to 53.4 in September, below the average forecast of economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Export orders, which had been strong owing to the weakness of sterling, slipped below the key 50 reading which indicates that demand is neither rising nor falling.At 49.28, it was the weakest in more than a year. Markit said that the decline was mainly in orders from abroad for consumer goods; demand for intermediate and investment goods remained fairly strong. There were declines in sales to customers based in Europe, the US and Russia.But the picture for new orders generally was brighter; these were higher in September at 52.44, although much weaker than they had been earlier in the year and below the average of the previous 15 months, when they had been expanding.The latest manufacturing survey comes amid signs that the burst of activity seen in the spring is slowing. Manufacturing and export orders are key to government efforts to rebalance Britain’s debt-laden economy away from domestic consumption.There are other signs that the strong growth seen in the second quarter is flagging. Earlier this week, official data on the UK’s much larger services sector for July - the first month of the third quarter - had slipped from June levels, and that activity was particularly weak in financial services and other business, its biggest single category. Next week, the forward-looking PMI services survey is to be released on Tuesday.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said that manufacturing was now expanding at its weakest rate for more than a year, which marked a slowdown from an exceptionally strong rate of growth.“However, more worrying is the order book trend, with total orders rising only slightly following the marked downshift in August and new export orders falling for the first time since July 2009,” he said.Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, noted that the employment reading within the index also fell, suggesting that the private sector will have difficulty absorbing workers made redundant in the public sector in months ahead..Another forward-looking component of the index, backlogs of orders, rose from levels in August but is still contracting, with a reading of 47.07."
852;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-09-23T09:23:11Z;Germany leads slowdown in eurozone;;Eurozone growth is slowing markedly, with Germany leading the deceleration, according to a closely watched survey.A larger-than-feared slump in purchasing managers’ indices for the 16-country region indicated that the pace of expansion had tumbled in September, presaging a significantly weaker final few months of the year.The weak data added to evidence that gloomier global prospects, a strengthening euro, and the crises conditions facing the Greek and Irish economies are taking a toll on eurozone prospects. They did not point to a double-dip recession in continental Europe as a whole – but highlighted the vulnerability of countries still struggling to bring their public finances under control. “The turn in the world trade cycle has finally reached the eurozone,” said Nick Kounis, economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.The eurozone economy expanded rapidly in the second quarter of this year, when gross domestic product surged 1 per cent compared with the previous three months, and by 2.2 per cent in Germany. However, the composite purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and service sectors and published on Thursday, fell from 56.2 in August to 53.8 in September – the lowest since February.The survey is regarded as a good indicator of likely trends in growth, with a figure above 50 indicating an expansion in activity. Germany saw a particularly sharp fall, with its composite index dropping from 58.4 in August to 54.8 in September.The latest readings were consistent with eurozone GDP growing 0.6 per cent in the third quarter but then slowing to 0.3 per cent in the final three months of the year, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.He added: “Growth in France remained reassuringly resilient, and a sharp slowing in Germany may merely represent an expected cooling from the surging pace of expansion seen earlier in the year. However, outside of these two countries, double-dip recession fears will be heightened by a renewed contraction of economic activity.”Earlier this week, the Bundesbank warned that the pace of German economic growth had weakened “markedly”. But it ascribed the slowdown to weaker global prospects and said the recovery remained “intact”. Although German policymakers worry about the county’s exposure to a fall in demand for its export goods, evidence is growing that the recovery is broadening with increases in real wages and falling unemployment gradually feeding through into stronger consumer spending.
853;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-09-22T21:28:21Z;Fed stance on easing sends dollar into retreat;Fed stance on easing sends dollar into retreat;Central bank policy was the chief theme of Wednesday’s session as global investors digested statements from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.The dollar hit a six-month low, gold raced to a record high and emerging market assets rallied after the US central bank’s open market committee on Tuesday signalled its willingness to provide “additional accommodation” if needed to support the economic recovery.“The statement has been widely interpreted as paving the way for the next stage of quantitative easing, with November being touted as the most likely date,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit. “The acknowledgement that the economy is weak, as well as the below-target inflation level, makes the economic data between now and February more important than ever.”Jim Reid, of Deutsche Bank, agreed that future QE would be data-dependent, adding: “There does seem to be an element of ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ about it at the moment as good economic data will no doubt be cheered but with bad data increasing the certainty of more QE and an injection of liquidity.”But Stephen Lewis, economist at Monument Securities, took a different tack on the FOMC statement.He noted that, in his recent Jackson Hole speech, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had identified three options for the Fed to “provide additional monetary accommodation” – through asset purchases, through cutting the interest it pays on bank reserves and through communication. “On the last of these, [Mr Bernanke] said – specifically – a ‘policy option for the FOMC would be to ease financial conditions through its communication, for example, by modifying its post-meeting statement’,” Mr Lewis said. “The question for markets is whether they have just seen Mr Bernanke exercising that option. It could just be that the change in wording is meant to be the policy response.”The Bank of England appeared to echo the Fed as the minutes of its last policy meeting heightened speculation that it, too, might act to stimulate the economy.“Should the global recovery take a turn for the worse, it is clear the Bank is prepared to take further action, either through buying gilts, or ‘credit easing’ through buying private sector assets,” said James Knightley, of ING.But some in the markets highlighted that UK inflation was proving far “stickier” than in the US. “The Fed thinks core inflation will plot a course below its ‘comfort zone’ into 2011 and the central projection of the Bank of England has UK consumer price inflation flirting with the upper boundary of the zone for a while longer,” said Sam Hill, UK fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The UK government bonds market, however, was unequivocal in its response to the central banks’ remarks.The 10-year gilt yield fell 14 basis points to 2.98 per cent – not far from August’s record low of 2.79 per cent. It was the biggest one-day slide for more than a year.In the US, the two-year Treasury yield rose 1 basis point off its all-time low, to 0.41 per cent.The 10-year German Bund yield slid 11bp to 2.34 per cent while the gap with the Portuguese 10-year yield narrowed 2bp to 383bp after Lisbon managed to sell €750m of debt – albeit at record high yields.On the currency markets, the auction offered a further plank of support to the euro as the dollar suffered a widespread sell-off.The trade-weighted dollar index fell below 80 for the first time since March as the euro rose to a five-month high above $1.3411 and the yen pushed towards the Y83 level that appeared to prompt Japan’s intervention last week.Equity markets came under pressure as investors fretted over the global economic outlook. The S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent, with losses picking up going into the close, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.5 per cent as bank shares tumbled. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.4 per cent. But emerging markets stocks inched up to their highest levels since July 2008, with Brazilian equities outperforming.In commodities, oil fell below $75 a barrel after news of a rise in US crude and product inventories last week. Spot gold hit a record high for a fifth successive session, reaching $1,296.30 an ounce.
854;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-09-15T21:30:32Z;Overview: Japan acts on yen but focus turns to Fed;Gold eases back from record high;Japanese intervention to halt the recent surge in the yen might have been the talk of the currency markets but had relatively muted impact elsewhere as the focus remained on the outlook for the US economy and the likelihood of fresh asset purchases by the Federal Reserve.“On the second anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, investors received a timely reminder of governments’ more active role in managing the global economy,” Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit, pointed out. “But, unlike September 15 2008, a government intervening in the economy – or not, as the case may be – had little impact beyond the currency markets.”The unilateral move by Japan – its first intervention in six years – helped drive the yen down more than 3 per cent from a 15-year high against the dollar. The Japanese currency also fell against the euro and sterling.Most analysts agreed the action had been very well-timed and had an impressive initial impact. But scepticism abounded as to whether a turning point had been reached.“As economic uncertainty still grips the world, it is likely that flows into the yen could remain strong for some time,” said Dan Cook, senior analyst at IG Markets. “As we have seen with intervention attempts by the Swiss National Bank, it probably takes a lot more money than any central bank is willing to print to defy the larger economic forces at work.”Indeed, the day’s US economic releases did little to quell the mood of uncertainty among investors.The Empire State survey showed that manufacturing in the New York area expanded this month at its slowest pace for more than a year. Industrial output in the US as a whole rose just 0.2 per cent in August, less than expected, after a downwardly revised 0.6 per cent gain in July.In spite of the uncertain picture painted by Wednesday’s US releases, Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, said the slightly stronger tone of the data of the past few weeks should have damped speculation that the Fed would soon countenance a second round of quantitative easing. “That said, the bond and equity markets still seem to be bewitched by the possibility that the Fed could resume its asset purchases within another few months,” Mr Ashworth said.“We don’t anticipate any major announcement at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday. We doubt the statement accompanying the decision will change much either.”A burst of speculation that the Fed’s “QE2” was imminent helped drive US government bond yields and the dollar sharply lower on Tuesday.Ten-year Treasuries reversed that trend on Wednesday, with the yield edging up 1 basis point to 2.68 per cent. But talk that Japan might reinvest its dollar purchases into short-dated US debt helped nudge the two-year yield down 1bp to 0.48 per cent. Long-dated 30-year bond yields rose 7bp to 3.87 per cent.The 10-year German Bund yield rose 3bp to 2.41 per cent while the 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 8bp to 1.05 per cent.The steep drop in the yen helped Japanese equities jump to their highest close for a month. The Nikkei 225 Average climbed 2.3 per cent, its best performance since the end of July.But the firmer tone in Tokyo failed to filter through to Europe as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged down 0.3 per cent.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent. Despite the modest advance on Wall Street, the Vix volatility index – often used as a proxy for broad investor risk aversion – jumped 3.1 per cent to 22.2.Sovereign credit spreads lagged corporates with the gap between the Markit iTraxx SovX western Europe index and the Markit iTraxx Europe widening further. A lacklustre auction of Portuguese T-bills did little to help sentiment for peripheral sovereigns, analysts said.Uncertainty over the global recovery put pressure on commodity prices. Oil retreated in spite of news of a larger-than-expected fall in US crude oil inventories last week.Copper did not make a decisive move, while gold fell to $1,267 an ounce from the previous session’s record high of $1,274.75.
855;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-09-13T21:53:16Z;Overview: Basel III and China data bolster confidence;;A wave of confidence swept through financial markets as investors took encouragement from robust Chinese economic data and breathed a sigh of relief that there were no unpleasant surprises in the Basel III rules on capital ratios for banks.Global equities reached their highest levels for a month on Monday, with the MSCI benchmark emerging market stock index registering a 20 per cent rise from its May low – the standard definition of a bull market. Commodity prices and “riskier” currencies such as the euro and the Australian dollar also advanced.“With the market comforted on the regulatory landscape as well as the China slowdown story the focus is once again on the potential that we will get a more significant resurgence in risk taking,” said Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets.The Vix volatility index – watched by many people as a broad indicator of investor risk aversion – was down 4 per cent and hovering just above its lowest level since early May.“The ‘fear gauge’ has managed to stay above 21 for the past few months and attempts at breaking this level have been met with failure,” said Mr Shah.“A break might provide an early indication that the tide has truly turned and the risk-on phase will promote a more violent correction on bonds.” The view in the markets was that the Basel III standards were less onerous than they could have been – not least because of their long implementation period. “Overall, the new capital requirements appear to have struck a balance between the obvious need for more stringency and the crucial role that banks have in supplying credit to a struggling global economy,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit. “The extended phase-in arrangements are also welcome as they lessen the pressure on banks that do need to raise capital.”Not surprisingly, gains for bank stocks provided the main boost to equity market indices. By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent and above its 200-day moving average, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.6 per cent to its highest close since April.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average gained 0.9 per cent. Mumbai hit a 32-month peak.Chinese stocks also advanced after Chinese data releases at the weekend were greeted positively by the markets – most notably a jump of 13.9 per cent in August industrial production from a year earlier, the most in three months.Chinese retail sales and bank lending also picked up, while consumer price inflation reached its highest level since October 2008.“The August data together suggest that policymakers have managed to slow growth from the unsustainably fast pace seen at the start of the year without pushing the economy into a severe downturn,” said Brian Jackson at RBC Capital Markets.More good news came as the European Commission almost doubled its forecast for eurozone growth in 2010, largely due to a robust performance from Germany.The improved outlook for the global economy offered a broad boost to commodities markets. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of 19 raw materials touched a five-week high, with West Texas oil briefly climbing above $78 a barrel and copper rallying sharply.Gold dipped slightly to $1,244 a troy ounce as the improved tone to risk appetite was offset by physical demand for the metal.Commodity-linked currency markets had a strong session, with the Australian dollar hitting a five-month high against its US counterpart, and the Canadian dollar also gaining ground. The euro, meanwhile, climbed above $1.28 and rose 1.1 per cent against the recently buoyant yen.Peripheral eurozone government bonds outperformed German paper, with the 10-year Bund yield rising 2 basis points to 2.42 per cent and the 30-year yield climbing back above 3 per cent for the first time in three weeks.But US Treasury bond prices rose as bargain hunters moved in after last week’s losses and the Federal Reserve purchased $3.4bn of debt to support the economy. The 10-year yield fell 5bp at 2.73 per cent. The 30-year yield was 3bp lower at 3.84 per cent.
856;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-09-01T18:33:09Z;Sharp slowdown in UK manufacturing;;Manufacturing suffered a sharp slowdown last month amid uncertainty about the nature and extent of public spending cuts, adding to fears that the economy was weakening.The manufacturing sector purchasing managers index slipped from 56.9 to 54.3, where a figure above 50 means that companies are reporting rising activity.This is still above the long-term average, and suggests the sector is growing, but comes as other signs pointing to slower expansion in the second half of the year.The fall in the index continues a trend of slowing growth in the sector since reaching a peak in May. Growth in activity is at its lowest in nine months and manufacturing output is now expanding at its slowest rate in 11 months.A rapid deceleration in new orders lay behind much of the slowing activity, which suggests there may be further weakness ahead. Employment growth also slowed in the month to its weakest since March.“The looming public sector spending cuts are keeping UK manufacturers on tenterhooks and slowing the pace of the recovery,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which produces the data with Markit, the polling company.“Businesses are taking a more cautious approach to new orders, with growth of order books slowing sharply in August. The government spending review in October should bring more clarity to the situation.”Ben Broadbent, of Goldman Sachs, said: “Growth looks to have slowed from the spring, closer to around its long-term average.”The slower growth came as the equivalent index for the eurozone hit a six-month low. The measure of export orders in the UK data continues to disappoint. “The hoped for support from exports has been fizzling out in recent months,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit.“The latest PMI survey will add to market jitters about the risks of a double-dip,” said Ross Walker, economist at RBS.The measure for the services side of the economy showed a sharp fall in confidence in June, and other measures of business confidence appear to have been hit by fears over the nature of the spending cuts. But the figures jar slightly with data from the CBI employers’ group suggesting growth in manufacturing is still strong in August.
857;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-08-30T19:32:04Z;Britain sings its economic blues;The UK economy is doing better than people think;The British are among the gloomiest in the west about the prospects of their economy. And yet the country’s economic data are stronger than for many years. British cynicism, at least in this case, seems rather unjustified.The latest figures are encouraging. Second quarter growth, revised up to 1.2 per cent last week by the Office for National Statistics, was the strongest since 2001. Manufacturing output – a bellwether of overall economic performance – is powering back to pre-crisis levels on the back of robust domestic demand. Job creation hit its highest rate in 21 years in July, resulting in a 0.2 percentage point drop in unemployment.Most significant, British exporters are finally beginning to benefit from sterling’s depreciation. Export volumes grew by 15.5 per cent in the second quarter, the fastest rate in nearly 30 years. For too long exporters have been content to pocket the profits from foreign currency revenues. Only now is the lower exchange rate feeding through into lower export prices. These can fall much further still.Curiously, these trends have not inspired confidence in British consumers. According to a Markit/YouGov index, 47 per cent of households expect their finances to deteriorate over the next yea r – twice as many as those predicting an improvement. Nor have businesses been cheered by the data. Several surveys indicate that business confidence has taken a big hit in recent months.So why the pessimism? It is true that inflation has remained stubbornly high since the crisis began. So has unemployment: the recent drop only brings it down to 7.8 per cent, and many of the new jobs being created are only part-time.But the key factor is the planned cuts in public spending. Consumers expect them to squeeze their incomes, while businesses expect them to constrain demand. These concerns have only been compounded by the Con-Lib coalition’s fearsome austerity rhetoric and the opposition’s warnings about what cuts might lead to. Revealingly, household confidence only began to fall after the new government came to power.It would, of course, be naïve to ignore the potential threats to economic recovery. This newspaper has repeatedly argued that the government needs a credible contingency plan in case things turn sour. But extreme pessimism is unwarranted. It can even become, in worst-case scenarios, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The British must be careful that they do not talk themselves back into recession.
858;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Eurozone austerity takes toll on growth;;The eurozone’s growth spurt lost momentum this month, as an expansion in output in Germany and France failed to make up for a near standstill elsewhere in the 16-country region.A closely followed barometer of business activity on Monday pointed to a slower but still solid expansion in private sector activity, with the region’s prospects hanging largely on Germany and France, its two largest economies.“Growth in the rest of the euro area slowed to near stagnation and services even contracted again as austerity measures bit,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.The purchasing managers’ indices are regarded as an early indicator of business trends, and the latest readings contained some hope of growth continuing at a brisk pace, even if the US economy slows.But they intensified worries that the region will be marred increasingly by weaker growth in the peripheral eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, where fears remain over the stability of public finances.“If the US is sort of treading water and surviving, as it seems to be doing now, then Europe can decouple,” said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit. “The question is whether growth in Germany and France will be enough to pull the peripherals out of the slump …My hunch is that it is not and that we will see divergences widening.”The European Central Bank reported on Monday it had stepped up purchases of eurozone government bonds last week. The €338m it spent compared with just €10m in the previous week. That revived speculation the ECB had intervened in Irish bond markets.However, the total was still small compared with the €60.5bn it has spent since the emergency programme was launched at the height of the eurozone debt crisis in May.The composite eurozone purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and services, fell from 56.7 in July to 56.1 in August, a two-month low. Markit said August’s figure was consistent with gross domestic product expanding at a quarterly rate of 0.7 per cent.Excluding Germany and France, the indices showed growth was extremely modest in August and weaker than in July. Germany’s composite index rose to a four-month high of 59.3, up from 59.0 in July, a result of a rapid pick-up in the service sector. In contrast, France’s composite index dipped from 59.7 in July to 59.0 in August, the lowest for five months. But Markit argued that the survey still pointed to a robust recovery continuing.
859;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-08-22T23:02:36Z;Pessimism remains over UK economy;;Pessimism about the British economy continues to worry households and businesses, according to two surveys.As many as 47 per cent of households in August expected their personal finances to worsen in the next 12 months, almost twice as many as the 25 per cent who forecast an improvement, according to the Markit/YouGov Household Finance Index.The proportion of pessimists is marginally lower than in July, but is higher than in any other month since March last year.Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, attributed the gloom to “a backdrop of squeezed disposable income, stubbornly high inflation and ongoing public sector spending cuts”, as well as a “renewed bout of employment concerns”.The number who see things improving, however, recovered from a low of 21 per cent in July. And more respondents expect their income from employment to rise than to fall.But fears are rising over the safety of those incomes. Of those asked, 25 per cent thought their job security would worsen, against only 6 per cent expecting an improvement. Public sector workers were especially fearful, with 29 per cent foreseeing a decline in job security.Separately, a quarterly survey of business professionals revealed weakening confidence in the recovery.Respondents questioned in the Business Confidence Monitor, conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales and the advisory firm Grant Thornton, on balance expect the economic prospects for their businesses to continue to improve. But their confidence has lost strength since the second quarter of the year, when the UK economy surprisingly grew by 1.1 per cent.These concerns may yet prove unfounded. Exports grew at the fastest rate in almost 30 years in the second quarter. Exporters will hope this heralds the long-awaited export boom many expected to follow sterling’s depreciation from its high levels before the crisis.In the manufacturing and transport industries, which stand to gain most from greater exports, confidence is stronger than in the second quarter, bucking the overall trend in the BCM measures.
860;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-08-13T14:25:15Z;Fearful markets;Alarm is dangerous, even when it’s justified;Investors have turned against Ireland. Between August 3 and August 12 the spread on its sovereign credit default swaps rose by 41 per cent, to 282 basis points, according to Markit. The problem was not local. The most recent news has not suggested any change in the encouraging trends in gross domestic product and prices.Rather, Ireland was caught up in a new wave of fear. The nation’s sovereign spreads widened in tandem with those of Germany, the UK, Italy and France, and with the Markit index of European senior financial debt: all up by more than a fifth in the same period.The tidal move crossed markets and oceans: oil and US stocks fell by 7 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Conversely, most government bonds gained ground, classified as safe in investors’ Manichean logic. It was, as they say, “risk off”.On Friday it was once again “risk on”, after relatively good GDP numbers from the EU. But there is still much to be afraid of. The global balance sheet is so leveraged that a period of falling prices and GDP decline could easily lead to financial tragedy.Ironically, investors make such a tragedy more likely by their attempts to dodge its possible effects. The Irish government, for example, has managed its financing well, but in 2011 will still have to fund most of its deficit, which Moody’s expects will be 7 per cent of GDP. The European Central Bank and the EU stand as backups, but they too have to persuade investors to play along if something worse – defaults or pure money-printing – is to be avoided.In the markets, there is much more to fear than fear itself. But negative emotional extremism could prove just as dangerous as its positive counterpart did in the credit bubble.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
861;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-08-09T22:24:17Z;Anadarko looks beyond spill with $2bn issue;;Anadarko, the US partner to BP in the oil well at the centre of the Gulf of Mexico spill, sold $2bn in bonds on Monday, highlighting renewed confidence in the sector as well as strong demand for corporate debt in the US.In recent days, the cost of funding for companies caught up in the oil spill – as illustrated by the price of credit default swaps – such as BP, Anadarko, Halliburton and Transocean has fallen. The share prices of both BP and Anadarko are up more than 50 per cent from their recent lows.All four companies have seen their CDS levels – which provide a form of insurance against default on debt – fall back to levels not seen since the end of May, when BP abandoned efforts to stem the leak using a process called “top kill”.Five-year credit default swaps for BP, which have implied the company had a junk credit rating, have fallen to 212 basis points from a record high of more than 600bp, although they are more than quadruple the levels seen before the crisis. This month, the company said it had plugged the Gulf of Mexico leak.Bankers managing bond sales use the price of CDS, as well as the market price of outstanding bonds, to price new issues.Anadarko sold $2bn of seven-year bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to refinance bank debt. JPMorgan and Barclays Capital arranged the sale. Banks had received orders in excess of $6bn, and the bond was increased from an original size of $1.5bn. The yield was reduced to 6.375 per cent from initial price talk of 6.5 per cent.BP had also been considering a bond sale among its many funding options.Anadarko has a triple B minus rating by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, the lowest investment grade rating. Its CDS price has fallen to 297bp. It reached an end-of-day high of 735bp at the end of June, according to data provider Markit.Some bankers believe that, with the well plugged, companies that have felt shut out of debt markets could come back.“Despite the moratorium [on drilling] we are continuing to be strong . . . stuff happens but its business as usual,” said one bond investor. “The world needs oil.”The fundraising also highlights extremely strong demand from US investors for bonds, with the weekly volume of bonds sold last week reaching their highest levels all year, according to data provider Dealogic.The robust demand has allowed US companies to secure some of the cheapest bond market funding, with IBM last week selling bonds to investors at the lowest rate for any corporate bond, according to bankers.It raised $1.5bn in three-year bonds with a coupon of 1 per cent, or just 30bp over Treasuries. According to Barclays, the coupon is the lowest of all 3,500 bonds in its US corporate index.
862;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Service sector confidence dips in July;;Service sector companies reported weaker activity in July compared with the previous month, disappointing economists who said the rapid recovery in the second quarter was “a blip” that would disappear in the autumn.The closely watched purchasing managers survey for private services dropped to 53.1 last month from 54.4 in June. Although the figure is still associated with a growing service sector, the result was the weakest in this survey for 13 months and was below economists’ expectations of an unchanged figure.In contrast to a weakening service sector in the UK, the equivalent eurozone PMI rose in July to 55.8, a touch higher than 55.5 the previous month. The relative strength in the eurozone was the result of rapidly rising sentiment in France and Germany offsetting weaker readings in southern Europe, particularly Italy.With the business expectations component of the UK PMI index recovering only slightly in July after a plunge in June following the emergency Budget, economists said looming public spending cuts were damping private sector companies’ expectations of demand growth, employment and investment.“Behind the weaker growth profile for the service sector is a failure of confidence to rebound from the record fall seen in the aftermath of the emergency Budget,” said Paul Smith, an economist at Markit.He added: “Expectations about prospects for the coming year appear to have down-shifted in response to the austerity measures announced in June, with reports of cancelled contracts and reduced enquiries adding to the sense that tough times lie ahead.”Economists disagreed about what the figure implied for growth in the third quarter. Capital Economics said the data suggested the economy was currently growing at a rate of about 0.5 per cent, Malcolm Barr at JP Morgan opted for a 0.6 per cent rate of growth, while Ben Broadbent of Goldman Sachs reckoned the economy was expanding at a rate of around 0.8 to 0.9 per cent. The majority of economists saw the data as disappointing and believed the economy was slowing.Alan Clarke of BNP Paribas said the strong second quarter now appeared to be “a blip”. His view was that the economy was heading at best for a “soft patch” and that was not the environment in which the monetary policy committee should be worrying about inflation and thinking about raising interest rates.A slightly brighter piece of data came from Halifax, the mortgage lender, on Wednesday when it reported that house prices rose by 0.6 per cent in July, reversing the fall in June.The various house price indices have been volatile this year, showing few consistent patterns, and Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said the fluctuating rate was “in line with our view that house prices will be broadly unchanged over 2010 as a whole”.The abolition of Home Information Packs had increased the supply of properties on the market, Mr Ellis said, which had “relieved much of the pressure that was driving up prices in 2009”.
863;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Slowdown in global factory output;;The global industrial recovery remains patchy and may be losing momentum, a raft of reports released on Monday suggested.Surveys of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector released in the US, the eurozone, Britain and across Asia showed that while industrial output continued to expand, it had slowed from the rapid pace of earlier months.The purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone in July was revised slightly higher from a preliminary estimate. But while it showed few signs of the recovery stalling, the survey revealed that growth was heavily dependent on Germany’s export-driven manufacturing sector. Growth prospects remained weak elsewhere, with the French index dropping to the lowest for 10 months.“This is clearly a very uneven recovery,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the research company which produces the survey. “Only in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria are manufacturers taking on staff in significant numbers.”The equivalent measure for the US showed manufacturing slowing in July for the third month running, adding to evidence that the recovery is cooling. The Institute of Supply Management said on Monday its index of factory activity fell to 55.5 in July from 56.2 in June. It was the 12th consecutive month that the measure was above 50, signifying an expansion in output, but was the lowest reading since December.Indices for China, Taiwan and South Korea also showed a slowdown, but this generally involved a return to normal growth rather than dipping below trend. In India manufacturing activity expanded, albeit marginally.While the global recovery has continued steadily this year, the pattern of industrial output has largely recreated the imbalanced economic growth of the decade before the global financial crisis, with the eurozone largely dependent on German manufacturing.Separate to the purchasing managers’ survey, the VDMA German engineering association reported that orders placed with its members in June were 62 per cent higher than a year before. The rise largely reflected the extraordinary weakness of business in mid-2009. But Hannes Hesse, the VDMA’s director, said they underscored the “dynamism” of the sector.Britain provided a bright spot in an otherwise clouded picture for global manufacturing, with output continuing to grow in July.The measure of activity edged down to 57.3 in July from 57.6 in June, still a high reading that beat financial market forecasts of a drop to 57.0. As manufacturing recovers from the recession, these readings are naturally high. The July figure was not far from the 15-year high of 58.1 in May.Rob Dobson of Markit said the July data “suggest manufacturing will remain a strong contributor to gross domestic product in the third quarter, raising hopes that the growth of the economy may not slow significantly from the 1.1 per cent bumper figure for GDP [gross domestic product] in the second quarter”.In Asia, economists said growth would remain resilient, thanks to the solid fiscal fundamentals and strong domestic demand.Dong Tao, chief economist for non-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse, said “deceleration is in the picture already” as governments around the world cut back on fiscal spending, but Asian economies would outperform because they generally did not have debt problems and their banking system remained healthy.By Alan Beattie in Washington, Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt, Alan Rappeport in New York, Chris Giles in London and Justine Lau in Hong Kong
864;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-08-01T22:55:29Z;Companies plan to lift capital spending;;"Companies across the world remain confident that the economic recovery is durable, with increasing numbers now planning additional capital expenditure in the year ahead.In a survey conducted in June of more than 6,000 manufacturing and service sector companies across all leading economies, confidence about business activity in the next 12 months was as high as in February, despite renewed turbulence following the Greek crisis.With few exceptions, such as Greece, companies were overwhelmingly positive about the future and the survey indicates that they are planning on the basis that the expected slowdown in the second half of this year does not persist.Most encouraging will be the finding that a growing majority of companies think it is the right time to plan higher capital expenditure and increase employment.The research, conducted by Markit on behalf of KPMG, the professional services company, is based on the same sample of companies used in monthly purchasing managers’ indices, but asks questions about the coming year rather than current conditions.The net balance of companies expecting a rise in activity stayed at very high levels in June and almost unchanged from February, with 50 per cent more manufacturing companies expecting output to rise than those expecting a fall. This is the equivalent of three in four companies with an optimistic outlook.The net balance for companies in the service sector was equally strong at 43.9 per cent, again unchanged from February. But in the composition of these headline rates, the outlook has brightened with the net balance for manufacturing employment rising from 14.6 per cent in February to 20.9 per cent in June and a slightly smaller increase in the service sector.Plans for capital expenditure in manufacturing are rising with a net balance of 21.7 per cent compared with 15.5 per cent in February, with the largest gains in the advanced economies of the US, Europe and Japan. Industries seeing the largest rise in confidence about investment include electrical and optical equipment, transport, and chemicals and plastics.Alan Buckle of KPMG said the results “add up to a growing feeling of a quality upturn; the sort of upturn which was hinted at in the previous Outlook survey but which needed further evidence of sustained confidence, increased investment and improved employment prospects before it felt convincing.“It is particularly encouraging that businesses now appear ready to invest. There is an increased expectation of higher employment and capital investment in many countries, suggesting many businesses are ready to put their cash reserves to good use, taking the baton from governments, which are keen to unwind stimulus packages,” he said.When results are broken down by country, US companies are shrugging off fears of a double-dip recession and preparing to hire and invest in both the manufacturing and services sectors.Most European companies are also confident and recovering from the shock of the crisis with the important German manufacturers leading the way, but European business confidence reflects the recent performance of each country.Following the sovereign debt crisis, the majority of Greek companies see little to be positive about. Confidence in Greek manufacturing has been falling since last October and the net balance stands at -43 per cent with companies expecting falling profits and planning to cut back on employment and investment.Of other peripheral eurozone economies, only Spain seems to have been hit by the Greek crisis. Confidence in manufacturing there has fallen from +36 per cent in February to +27 per cent in June.Among emerging economies, Brazilian and Russian companies see the outlook improving significantly, with India closing the gap. In China, there is concern over the slowing economy."
865;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-27T22:07:13Z;Contradictory figures feed investor uncertainty;;Robust earnings news and positive developments on the banking regulatory front provided a positive backdrop for the markets on Tuesday, although data showing a steep drop in US consumer confidence offered a reminder of some of the headwinds facing the global recovery.News that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision had relaxed some of its proposals and delayed others was welcomed by investors.“In particular, a relaxation of the net stable funding ratio should reduce the potential funding gap and lower term debt supply expectations,” said Gavan Nolan, credit strategist at Markit. “This shift in stance from Basel is clearly a positive development for banks.”The mood further improved with the release of encouraging quarterly results from Deutsche Bank and UBS. The figures heightened the increasingly positive sentiment towards European banks following the results of “stress tests” on the sector, published late last week.And there was positive corporate news away from financials, as quarterly earnings from US chemicals group DuPont easily outstripped expectations. Worries about the US housing market eased slightly after data showed a second successive monthly rise in US home prices in May – although some economists said this trend was unsustainable.The broadly market-friendly newsflow came to an abrupt halt, however, as the Conference Board said its confidence index had fallen to 50.4 in July, a five-month low, from an upwardly revised 54.3 in June. The expectations component of the report dropped to 66.6 from 72.7.“Falling consumer confidence and the growing likelihood of a double-dip in house prices have put a further dent in the already deteriorating outlook for consumption growth,” said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. “Without consumers on board, the economic recovery is looking dangerously vulnerable.”The data unsettled US and European equity markets. In New York, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index pared an earlier advance to end 0.5 per cent higher – although banking stocks held the bulk of their gains.Asian markets had a similarly uncertain session, with the Nikkei 225 Average slipping 0.1 per cent and the Shanghai Composite snapping a six-day run of gains.But in spite of the wobbles in equity markets, core government bonds suffered further losses as their haven appeal continued to wane. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 5 basis points at 3.05 per cent while the 10-year German Bund yield rose 2bp to 2.77 per cent, having touched a two-month high of 2.79 per cent.Increasing risk appetite was in evidence among peripheral sovereign bonds. The spread between 10-year Spanish and German yields narrowed 9bp to 132bp, the lowest since May 20. Spain sold €971m of three-month bills at an average yield of 0.672 per cent, compared with 0.913 per cent at an auction in June,The continued easing of concerns over eurozone sovereign debt was also in evidence on the currency markets. The euro climbed above $1.30 to touch an 11-week high against the dollar before easing back slightly.Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon, noted that the euro had been the easiest route for investors to translate sentiment about Europe’s structural imbalances and their impact on the global economy.“Given improving global equities sentiment and easing concerns about Europe’s systemic risk amid tightening spreads on Spanish debt after the bank stress tests, it is unsurprising that the euro is back trying to overcome the $1.30 psychological level,” she said.The fading concerns about sovereign eurozone debt also dented the attractiveness of gold. The metal dipped to a three-month low of $1,159 a troy ounce.Other commodity prices lost ground as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index of 19 commodity prices suffered its biggest one-day loss for a month. US oil fell more than 2 per cent to $77.37 a barrel, though it held within its recent range. Copper shed 1.5 per cent.
866;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-23T21:01:51Z;Equity traders breathe a sigh of stress relief;Encouraging earnings and robust European data helped bolster confidence;Encouraging earnings reports and robust European data releases helped to bolster market confidence this week, with investors shrugging off Friday’s news that seven European banks had failed stress tests.“Corporate USA generally delivered second-quarter results at or above market expectations which in turn kept stock markets supported,” said Ole Hansen at Saxo Bank.The results of the stress tests, published after European markets had closed yesterday, had little initial impact.The disclosure that seven out of the 91 institutions examined had failed the tests was roughly in line with expectations in the markets – although there remained plenty of scepticism about the methodology used.“The long-awaited bank stress tests do not seem to have been that stressful after all,” said Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities.“This is not surprising. The last thing the authorities would have wanted to do was to set a series of assumptions that would have led to a broad failure across the euro area, as this could only do more damage to the already frail markets.”Gavan Nolan, credit strategist at Markit, said: “Whether the tests produce the cathartic effect that we saw last year in the US remains to be seen – for an exercise in transparency the process has been remarkably opaque.”“But bank spreads have been tightening in recent weeks amid tentative optimism that the tests will ease concerns about balance sheet weakness, at least for the near time being.”Worries about a double-dip recession in the US remained at the fore after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, described the outlook as “unusually uncertain”.He also indicated that the US central bank stood ready to take further policy action to stimulate the economy – but only if required.“The Fed still believes the US is in a moderate economic recovery – as do we – and that no additional easing steps will be necessary,” said Dean Maki, economist at Barclays Capital.“Only if growth fell persistently below trend would the Fed be likely to implement additional measures, and we view that as unlikely.”Mr Bernanke’s comments came hard on the heels of a string of disappointing data on the US housing market. By contrast, robust European releases triggered suggestions by analysts that the region may avoid a potential double-dip.Encouraging purchasing managers’ surveys on eurozone manufacturing and services activity, plus a strong reading from the German Ifo business confidence index, offered support to the euro this week.The single currency was further bolstered by strong demand in a number of peripheral eurozone sovereign debt auctions through the week.The euro touched a two-month high against the dollar above $1.30, although it retreated slightly by the end of the week.Sterling, meanwhile, was buoyed by data showing the UK economy had grown at its fastest pace for more than four years in the second quarter. “Along with the stronger PMI and Ifo surveys in Europe this week the upside surprise on UK GDP may allay fears of a double-dip,” said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank.Meanwhile, a welter of forecast-beating quarterly results and upbeat outlook statements provided the driving force for a positive week for equity markets – although there were some high-profile disappointments.At midday in New York, the S&P 500 was sporting a weekly gain of 2.8 per cent, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 3.1 per cent.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 ended a shortened trading week with a gain of just 0.2 per cent, in spite of a 2.3 per cent jump yesterday.Shanghai stole the show in Asia when it rallied 6.1 per cent – its biggest weekly rise since December – amid growing hopes that the authorities could adopt a looser policy stance in months to come.Commodity markets put in a broadly strong showing, with the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global benchmark for prices, reaching a one-month high.US oil climbed to within a whisker of $80 a barrel, helped by a storm threat to the Gulf of Mexico’s energy infrastructure, while copper pushed above the $7,000 a tonne mark.But the general improvement in investor risk appetite, and the firmer tone of the dollar, pushed gold back below $1,200 an ounce.Government bonds also lost some of their haven appeal, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury edging up 2 basis points to 2.96 per cent over the week and the 10-year German Bund yield jumping 9bp to 2.70 per cent. But the two-year US Treasury yield touched a record low of 0.56 per cent in the aftermath of Mr Bernanke’s cautious comments, and retreated 2bp to 0.58 per cent.
867;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-22T11:12:05Z;Eurozone data ease double-dip fears;;Both manufacturing and services output in the eurozone grew faster than expected in July, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indices, driven by a strong performance in both sectors in Germany and in the services industry in France.The figures suggest that the danger of a double-dip recession in continental Europe is receding, although economists continue to expect a slowdown later in the year as government stimulus measures start to run down.Despite slower growth of export orders, the strong performance of the service sector indicates improving private consumption in the heart of the eurozone.Taken in isolation, the indices suggest a real growth rate of gross domestic product in the eurozone of 0.7 per cent in the third quarter – above the 0.5 per cent for the second quarter – but analysts warned against extrapolating the figures for the full quarter.“The flash PMIs for July show surprising improvements in rates of increase of both output and new orders, following two months of slower growth,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the information services company that compiles the data. “It’s a good start for the second half of the year. But we still really suspect that an easing in GDP growth is on the cards.“For the eurozone as a whole, it suggests a double dip will be avoided.”One factor behind the surprisingly strong recovery could have been a temporary boost from the recent World Cup, analysts said, during which there was a minor surge in consumer spending on goods and services.Markit’s Flash Eurozone PMI composite index, based on data collected from about 4,500 companies in the eurozone manufacturing and service sectors, rose to a three-month high of 56.7, compared with 56.0 in June, against expectations of a decline to 55.5 per cent.The eurozone manufacturing sector saw an acceleration in growth from 55.6 in June to 56.5 in July, and the services activity index rose from 55.5 to 56.0, according to the Markit indices.Both sectors showed an improved performance in Germany, the motor economy of the eurozone, with the services activity index rising to 57.3 from 54.8 last month, registering a 35-month high. Manufacturing continued to be the principal growth driver, with the manufacturing output index reaching 63.1, compared with 60.3 in June, the fastest expansion since a record high posted in April.In France, manufacturing output slipped to 56.6 from 56.9 in June, but services activity rose to 61.3 compared with 60.8 in the previous month, pushing up the composite index to 59.9 (59.6 in June). Growth of employment in the French private sector was recorded for the third consecutive month, with the rate of expansion of staffing levels – though still modest – improving faster than for any month since April 2008.The figures do not include any breakdown for the peripheral economies in the eurozone, where drastic budget austerity measures have caused a sharp slowdown in growth.“The full impact of the enormous fiscal tightening in large parts of the region has yet to be felt,” said Ben May, economist at Capital Economics. He said there was “encouragement that the recovery and the core eurozone has momentum, but concerns about the periphery are set to linger, if not deepen”.According to a separate indicator published by the European Commission in Brussels on Thursday, consumer confidence in the eurozone rose to a 26-month high in July, although it still remains relatively subdued. The eurozone index rose to -14.1 from -17.3 in June, according to the Commission, and to -13.8 from -14.9 for the European Union as a whole.
868;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Advertising cuts fuel double-dip recession fears;;Advertisers began cutting their budgets again in the second quarter, fuelling concerns about a double-dip recession. The IPA/BDO Bellwether report, which surveys 300 marketing managers every quarter, found 20 per cent had reduced their spending plans, compared with 15 per cent who were raising budgets.That marks a reversal on the previous quarter, which saw more companies setting higher budgets than lowering them for the first time since 2007.“The downward revision to marketing budgets in the second quarter is disappointing as it fails to build on the return to growth seen earlier in the year and highlights the fragility of the UK economic recovery,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and author of the Bellwether.Although marketing spending is still expected to increase during 2010, that rise comes from a low base, after the precipitous falls in last year’s media markets.“It is clear that there are increasing signs that uncertainty over economic prospects continue and that corporates remain focused on cost control against a backdrop of the risk of a double dip,” said Andy Viner, head of media at BDO.Advertising spending is seen as an indicator of broader economic confidence, because it is often the first item companies cut when they are concerned about growth. Fluctuations in marketing budgets have broadly tracked gross domestic product over the Bellwether’s 10 years in production, while the report correctly called the bottom of the market last July.The advertising market saw a strong start to the year, with television channels such as ITV benefiting from the resumption in spending. Indications of spending at ITV suggest a continuation of that good performance into September, with June’s advertising revenues up by more than 40 per cent thanks to the World Cup. But if the pessimists are right, media vulnerable to shorter-term planning, such as news­papers, could see the recovery stall later this year.Positive sentiment among the companies surveyed for the report hit its lowest for a year, with the proportion indicating a negative outlook rising to 25 per cent. Cuts were concentrated in sales promotions rather than media spending, suggesting fewer companies were discounting their wares to attract customers.Internet advertising saw a strong recovery, driven by the popularity of social networks. Search engine advertising also saw continued growth. But ad agencies say the procurement departments brought in to negotiate hard bargains during the recession are now a permanent fixture of the marketing landscape.“There was a brief reprieve where everybody caught their breath and the Pavlovian response was to knee-jerk back into mindless optimism,” said Robert Senior, UK chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi Fallon, an agency group. “Actually, it was no more than that: a brief reprieve. This is going to last a while now, I think. Everybody is being asked to do more for less.”
869;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-08T19:22:41Z;Asian bond markets;Countries should try to develop deeper more liquid debt markets;"Asian policymakers are entitled to look askance at foreign bondholders. Those countries most badly affected by panicked selling 13 years ago learned harsh lessons in leverage, several of them under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund. Those that avoided a visit from the IMF, such as largely internally-funded India, saw their escape as validation of a more insular approach.In spite of those reservations, governments should consider giving a little ground. In some instances, an aversion to debt is retarding growth. Take Indonesia, subject to a huge public and private-sector deleveraging since the late 90s, where successive administrations have acknowledged the need to upgrade the country’s creaking infrastructure. Yet Jakarta continues to finance projects through tax revenues, rather than inviting overseas bond funds to chip in. Emerging Asia as a whole, representing a quarter of the world’s gross domestic product, has less than 8 per cent of its outstanding bonds.Developing deeper, more liquid bond markets will take time; in India and China, it will also involve relaxing strict quotas for foreigners. But anyone doubting that it makes sense should look to Korea, Asia’s biggest local-currency bond market as a percentage of GDP. The sharp post-Lehman slump in the won could have been a lot sharper had flows out of equities not re-directed into bonds, as they did.Meantime, Asia need not question foreigners’ appetite. For example, the five-year credit default swap of the Philippines, a double-B rated country with four fiscal surpluses in the past 25 years, is currently trading 30 per cent more cheaply than double-A Spain, and just inside single-A, G7 Italy. An index of CDS on 50 investment-grade Asian corporate borrowers outside Japan, tracked by Markit, has been practically flat to the equivalent European index since May.The eurozone’s crisis should remind borrowers of all stripes that you get credit problems and/or a plunging currency only if you give investors good reasons to take fright.

870;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Overview: Sentiment boosted as recession fears retreat;Equities and riskier currencies surge;A burst of confidence swept through the markets on Tuesday, lifting equities and riskier currencies as investors retreated from their most dire fears about a double-dip global recession. However, another poor US data release quelled the enthusiastic mood.Early in the session, investors latched on to upbeat comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia on the outlook for the domestic economy and, crucially, for growth in China and Latin America.“We can thank the Australians for a firmer tone to risk on Tuesday,” said Andrew Wilkinson at Interactive Brokers. “The statement underscored the health of the Asian economy and indicated that businesses were strengthening spending, as were consumers.”In Europe, further positives came from growing optimism that eurozone banks would weather “stress tests”, figures indicating that Greece’s fiscal plan was on track and reports that a syndicated 10-year bond issue by Spain had attracted solid demand.“Anecdotal evidence suggests the deal was oversubscribed and international demand was strong,” said Gavan Nolan, a credit strategist at Markit. “The latter point is key – earlier bond sales indicated the country was reliant on domestic banks to fund its deficit.”Spanish sovereign credit default swaps outperformed, tightening 13 basis points to 247bp, compared with a 6bp tightening for the Markit SovX Western Europe index.But worrying signals about the global recovery remained. The Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of dry bulk commodity shipping costs seen by many as a leading indicator for growth, fell for a 29th successive session to its lowest level for more than a year.A weak reading of activity in the crucial US services sector– was the latest in a succession of disappointing economic releases.The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses fell to a four-month low of 53.8 last month – still above the 50 level that indicates expansion, but down from 55.4 in May and well below the consensus forecast for a reading of 55.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, noted the huge importance of the services sector from a US jobs standpoint. “If the sector slows, it’s hard to make a case for robust expansion in labour market indicators,” he said.“Without that expansion, it’s hard to make a case for a sustained pick up in incomes, which in turn makes it difficult to argue for a robust pace of consumer spending.”Overall, global equities rallied. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 jumped 2.6 per cent from a six-week low, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose a more modest 0.8 per cent and emerging market stocks rose 2 per cent.US markets opened sharply higher, rising as much as 2 per cent. But they sank steadily thereafter. The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent after closing last Friday at a 10-month low.The Vix index of US equity volatility, closely watched as a measure of risk aversion, ended the session above 30, a level widely seen as a key threshold.“The best rallies come in bear markets. The market gets so oversold, the pessimism gets so thick, and with a lot of short-sellers in a down market, you get big short-term rallies,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co.He cautioned: “The fundamentals are weakening, and the technical backdrop is deteriorating. The primary trend, and the path of least resistance, is now down.”Commodity prices also initially rose strongly, with US oil futures back within striking distance of $74 a barrel and copper touching its highest level for a week. But oil prices reversed, ending near $72, and copper gave up 1.5 percentage points of its gain.Gold dropped below $1,200 an ounce, although US government bonds continued to see buying, with the 10-year yield down 4bp to 2.93 per cent. The 10-year German Bund yield, however, rose 4bp to 2.59 per cent.On the currency markets, the ISM services figures undermined demand for the dollar, while commodity-linked currencies – most notably the Australian and Canadian dollars – rallied strongly in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s remarks.
871;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-06T16:44:45Z;Bloomberg to launch derivatives valuation tool;;Bloomberg, the privately held news and information company, is making a further push into over-the-counter derivatives amid growing calls from regulators and lawmakers for increased transparency in the $615,000bn market.A new derivatives valuation service expected to be launched by Bloomberg this week will analyse derivative instruments and price them, allowing users to also look at the models and assumptions that underpin the instruments.The new service, which will charge users according to complexity and the size of the derivatives portfolio that has to be valued, is aimed at tapping into demand for more independent valuations of these contracts, which have been widely criticised for being too opaque.Users of derivatives, from corporate treasurers to institutional investors, have traditionally relied on valuation and pricing given by the banks which have structured and sold the deals.Jean-Paul Zammitt, global head of core product development at Bloomberg, said there were growing calls for a second opinion, even as the exact future shape of the derivatives industry remains unclear as regulators prepare to write many detailed new laws for privately-traded markets.“We do not know what the market will look like after financial regulation reform, whether it will be bigger or smaller. But we do know there is a need for more transparency and a need for independent valuations,” said Mr Zammitt.Numerous valuation specialists have emerged to try and value illiquid and complex securities and derivatives that were sold in the run-up to the financial crisis. Some consist of a handful of derivatives experts who have set up their own businesses. The Bloomberg service will also compete with larger rivals like Markit, which is owned by Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase.As efforts in the US and Europe to standardise derivatives and push more contracts through clearing houses and trading platforms move closer to finalisation, the new rules are expected to apply mostly to new derivatives contracts.This means there will still be large amounts of derivatives in the market that already exist – often referred to as legacy derivatives – which will have to be valued until they are unwound or expire. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the face value of over-the-counter derivatives contracts outstanding was $615,000bn at the end of last year.
872;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
873;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-05T23:14:20Z;Cuts to services seen as threat to economy;;Swingeing cuts to government spending risk upending the fragile business recovery, particularly in the services sector, a group of leading business figures warns in a fresh survey published on Monday.The British Chambers of Commerce’s quarterly economic outlook, follows on the heels of another private sector survey – known as the Markit/CIPS Services PMI survey – which on Monday showed businesses suffered their biggest one-month collapse in confidence in June. In particular, businesses cited fears about how cuts to government spending would affect demand for their services in the future.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiled the Markit/CIPS survey noted that in the 14-year history of the survey, “We have been through some tough times – 9/11, the collapse of Lehman Brothers.” No month has ever shown the fall in confidence seen since publication of the Government’s budget.The message that came through was “Government was almost walking away from supporting the recovery and moving towards settling their political agenda,” Mr Williamson said. Much of the data were collected before the Budget was unveiled on June 22, he said. Had the survey been conducted later, the drop in confidence might have even been bigger.The findings were startling because although labour unions and some public interest groups have lambasted the spending cuts, business groups have been active cheerleaders of government efforts to curb spending.The BCC did find increasing optimism in Britain’s manufacturing sector, which was particularly hard hit in the recession. A balance of 42 per cent more manufacturers reported confidence rising, rather than falling – the most upbeat outlook for the sector for more than two years.But the balance of those reporting rising optimism among services firms fell to 29 per cent. Several presidents of regional Chambers of Commerce expressed concern about the impact of government retrenchment.“With a number of companies in the region supplying the public sector, there are understandable concerns about the impact that budget cuts could have,” said Peter Brumby, chairman of the South Tyneside Committee.“Independent commentators predict our region will be one of the hardest hit by the public sector cuts ahead,” said Angie Robinson, chief executive of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, adding that corporate cash flow remained an issue.Richard Wightman, president of the Yorkshire & Humber Chambers of Commerce, said: “Many firms supplying local authorities and other public bodies are already noticing cutbacks, which is an issue given the importance of . . . public sector spending to [several] of our towns and cities.”Domestic orders also rose for manufacturers. Services account for the bulk of the UK’s private sector output. “The poor cash flow balances, for both manufacturing and services, indicate that many businesses are still facing serious financial difficulties,” the BCC said.
874;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-05T09:55:30Z;Service sector growth slows in UK;;Britain’s services sector expanded in June at the slowest rate in 10 months, according to a closely watched index, amid signs of growing nervousness about the impact of government spending cuts on economic activity.The Markit/CIPS UK services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for June was weaker than consensus forecasts among economists, showing a 54.4 headline reading, down from 55.4 in May. Economists had expected a more modest decline for June of 55.Sterling sank to $1.5160 against the dollar after the figures were announced, compared with $1.5170 beforehand.It was the weakest reading in the index since August 2009. Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said that fears about the effects of government spending cuts had led to the single largest recorded monthly fall in services providers’ confidence. Business expectations fell from a reading of 72.1 in May to 64.The services PMI is particularly closely watched because it accounts for the greatest share of private sector business output.“Worrying signs for the UK service sector appeared in June as growth slowed in response to another below-par increase in new business,” said Mr Smith. “Confidence declined to the greatest extent in 14 years of data collection in reaction to the government’s austere emergency budget, with concern expressed that the fiscal tightening could push the country back into recession.”New business continued to grow – the sub-component rose to 53.4 in June from 52.8 in May – but economists noted that the pace of growth appeared to be slowing.Another positive note came from a slight rise in the employment sub-component of the index, which rose to 50.1, just reaching the level at which it is seen to be expanding, from a reading of 49.7 the month before.However, other components within the index point to weakness. Order backlogs fell to 46.7 from 48.1 and prices charged to customers were almost unchanged.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), which co-sponsors the index, said there were signs that companies were increasingly hesitant to commit to expansion at a time of uncertainty. “June’s data painted a worrying picture for the UK services sector as confidence suffered a serious blow following the government’s emergency spending cuts,” Mr Noble said.
875;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-07-01T19:09:02Z;Slowing export growth adds to economic angst;;Fears for the economy rose on Thursday after surveys showed that export growth slowed in June and banks expected to cut mortgage lending in the next quarter.Manufacturing grew strongly in June, according to the index of purchasing managers but export growth dropped, in a sign that the European debt crisis was hitting demand in the biggest market for UK goods abroad.The purchasing managers index for manufacturing recorded a level of 57.5 in June, close to the 15-year highs seen in April and May. Employment in the sector grew at its fastest since early 1995, in a sign the recovery in activity is helping to boost jobs but the growth in exports slowed sharply.New export business rose only slightly in June, recording a level of 50.7, down from a series high of 59.9 two months ago, and at its lowest since August.The sharp slowdown came as “the fragile recovery in the eurozone and recent strengthening of the exchange rate against the euro had impacted on sales to mainland Europe”, the report noted.Hopes for a durable recovery in the UK rest substantially on the weak pound making goods more competitive and driving up export growth.“Most UK forecasts have been looking for net exports to play a key role in the recovery and that might already be in some doubt,” said Brian Hilliard, economist at Société Générale .“It’s been a tense month for the UK manufacturing sector,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which produces the data with polling company Markit.The report came amid signs that global manufacturing took a hit in June, with China, the US and the eurozone all seeing weaker growth in the sector.The slowdown in China was the biggest since after Lehman Brothers’ collapse, said Markit. Countries suffering from public sector cuts such as Spain and Ireland – also big export partners for the UK – were approaching stagnation in manufacturing.“The extent of the change in the UK is very worrying,” said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit. “It’s a global slowdown.” He said the slower growth partly reflected the fact that companies were making fewer orders to build up stocks, but it was also a result of weakening demand in the euro area and increased nervousness among companies and households.The report on exports came as a survey of credit conditions by the Bank of England underlined concern at prospects for demand in the UK. It pointed to a prospective slowdown in the supply of credit for buying houses, thanks to an anticipated tightening in wholesale funding markets caused by the euro crisis. Credit conditions were expected to deteriorate by the most since the first quarter of 2009, when the recession was at its deepest.

877;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Calmer mood as European fears recede;Depressing news keeps investors on defensive;Calmer conditions briefly prevailed in the markets on Wednesday as concerns about the health of the European banking system eased, but a fresh batch of depressing economic releases kept investors on the defensive amid worries about the global economic recovery.As a tumultuous quarter finally drew to a close, the euro was the chief beneficiary of an encouraging three-month tender operation by the European Central Bank.Banks borrowed just €131.9bn ($161bn) in three-month funds from the ECB, less than feared, soothing worries about a liquidity crunch when €442bn of one-year loans expire today.“The outcome is a sign that liquidity is not a major issue for the eurozone banking sector as a whole, although stresses remain in some countries,” said Nick Kounis, chief European economist at Fortis Bank.“In addition, counterparty risk is still a big issue and stress in the interbank market is likely to linger until trust returns.”Gavan Nolan, credit strategist at Markit, said the fact that only 171 banks had taken advantage of the ECB’s facility on Wednesday could be viewed positively.“But it could also be seen as worrying that an average of €771m was being borrowed by each bank. The ECB doesn’t reveal what banks participated, and there remains the possibility that the dependence is concentrated on the weakest parts of the European banking industry.”Meanwhile, there was unwelcome newsflow on the US labour market as ADP Employer Services said private sector jobs had increased by just 13,000 in June, the smallest amount for four months, after a 57,000 increase in May. The figures heightened concerns about Thursday’s June non-farm payrolls release, one of the most closely watched sets of economic data.Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS, said the ADP figures were consistent with a labour market that was ‘lethargic at best, moribund at worst.’“The data then play to a very cautious tone for risky assets, where many players are seeing whether the S&P can maintain closing levels above 1,040,” he said.“Technicals turn decidedly bearish beyond there and will thereafter tend to play toward selling upticks in the likes of the commodity currencies.”The June PMI for the Chicago region declined for the second straight month, which economists said augured bad news for the national ISM manufacturing index report due next week.Equities staged a brief turnaround at midday, but by close US stocks extended their fresh 2010 lows reached on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was down 1 per cent. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo tumbled 2 per cent.Bears received further support from Moody’s, which said it was considering a downgrade of Spain’s sovereign debt from Aaa, citing stretched fiscal conditions. That would match similar moves by Fitch and S&P earlier this year.With uncertainty still running high about the strength of the US labour and housing markets, analysts were not surprised to see government bond yields also reaching new lows.The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below the psychological 3 per cent level which it breached on Tuesday for the first time in 14 months. It fell 1 basis point to 2.95 per cent.The two-year yield was 2bp higher at 0.61 per cent, after hitting a record low of 0.59 per cent in the previous session.In Germany, the 10-year Bund yield rose 2bp to 2.57 per cent – reflecting the weak take-up at the ECB tender – while the 10-year Gilt yield fell 3bp to 3.35 per cent after data showed UK consumer confidence falling to the lowest level in six months.On the currency markets, the UK figures also weighed on sterling, along with comments by a Bank of England policymaker highlighting the fragility of the UK economy. The pound was particularly hard-hit against the buoyant euro.Industrial commodity prices fell again after Tuesday’s heavy losses. The benchmark US crude oil future was down 0.7 per cent at $74.50 a barrel, Copper touched its lowest for a week before recouping much of its decline.Gold rose for a second day as haven buying was prompted by the disappointing US jobs data.
878;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-06-25T13:13:55Z;BP’s shares hit 14-year low;;"BP’s shares fell to a 14-year low on Friday as concerns grew that the company would have to raise larger-than-expected cash funds to pay the costs associated with its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.BP’s share price at one point fell to below 300p, as traders also cited worries about a tropical storm that could further delay BP’s attempts to kill the leaking well and push more oil to Gulf’s shores.Credit markets were also increasingly concerned amid talk that the company may need to bolster its liquidity, according to analysts at data provider Markit.The cost of protecting against the default of BP on its bonds rose by $44,000 per annum to $580,000 (or 580 basis points, up 44 bps on the day) to protect $10m of bonds from default for five years.The price of credit default swaps for BP rose amid a worsening credit market generally, tracking weaker stock markets.BP said on Friday that it had spent $2.35bn on the clean-up so far, compared with $2bn announced at the start of this week.However, the market is more concerned about the costs BP could incur because of its broader liabilities towards those affected by the spill.BP last week set up a $20bn escrow account in an agreement with the White House.At the time, it said the company had $5bn in cash and $10bn in committed banking facilities. Those amounts are now believed to be considerably higher.BP has cancelled its dividend for three quarters and pledged to raise at least $10bn by selling assets, with further funds coming from reduction in capital expenditure, much of which analysts believe will be connected to the sold assets.BP has not yet decided which assets it will sell, but said it would reach the $10bn by the end of the year, suggesting it will have to do more next year.Alastair Syme and his team of equity analysts at Nomura wrote in a note on Friday: “A heavy inversion of both credit yield and equity volatility suggests the market is concerned about a near-term credit event around BP. Creating a scenario that puts near-term liquidity [of US$11bn-plus] at risk looks remote; however, we recognise that with an uncapped well, hurricane season and continued media focus the market will struggle to get much comfort.”He added: “We think this perception of near-term credit risk is highly damaging for BP, likely leading to constraints around counterparty trading, the attractive roll of drawn commercial paper and the ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices.”Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, in his speech to employees on Thursday spent some time explaining that BP needed to show a strong cash position to persuade the market the company could meet the costs and liabilities of the spill.He said: “You will see in a month from now that our operating results are very strong.” He was referring to BP’s second-quarter earnings announcement at the end of July.Additional reporting by Jamie Chisholm"
879;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-06-23T10:04:22Z;Eurozone growth spurt starts to splutter;;The eurozone’s economic growth spurt is showing fresh signs of losing momentum with a closely-watched survey flashing warnings of a slowdown ahead.June’s purchasing managers’ indices for the 16-country region indicated that the brisk pace of export-led economic expansion seen in the second quarter of this year marked a peak in the upswing.The latest readings could heighten worries of a lacklustre eurozone economy being hit increasingly by recessionary conditions in southern Europe, as well as fiscal austerity measures and weaknesses in banking systems across the continent.The composite eurozone purchasing managers’ index, which covers manufacturing and services and is regarded as an early guide to trends in economic activity, fell from 56.4 in May to 56, the lowest level for three months.With a figure above 50 pointing to an expansion in economic activity, that was consistent with eurozone gross domestic product rising by 0.6 per cent or more in the second quarter compared with the previous three months – which would be the fastest since the start of 2008.The still-robust figure highlighted how Europe’s debt crisis has had little impact on real economic activity. “The eurozone economy retains plenty of forward momentum – a sign that the economic impact of the sovereign debt crisis has thus far remained fairly contained,” said Martin van Vliet at ING.However, details of the index showing growth in output, orders and exports weakening “suggest that economic growth will moderate as we move into the second half of the year”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.In turn, the slowdown could act as a break on labour market improvements, Mr Williamson added, “highlighting the region’s ongoing dependence on exports rather than domestic demand to sustain the recovery”.Germany’s purchasing managers’ indices confirmed the strength of its industry-led recovery, with the composite index edging up from 56.4 in May to 56.6 this month. German growth in the second quarter is also likely to have been boosted by catch-up effects after a severe winter, which hit construction activity. Earlier this week, the Munich-based Ifo institute reported its business climate index had risen to the highest for more than two years – but its survey also showed rising pessimism about the next six months.In contrast, the economic recovery in France is being driven more by the service sector. France’s composite index remained unchanged at May’s 60.1, but the service sector index rose from 61.4 to 61.6 – the highest level for almost four years.Earlier this month, the European Central Bank revised up its forecast for eurozone growth this year, which it expected to be about 1 per cent. But it revised down its forecasts for 2011 growth to within a range with a mid point of 1.2 per cent, because of the weaker prospects for domestic demand.
880;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-06-15T20:54:34Z;Investors overcome early caution to push rally on;Euro makes further gains;Tuesday 22:20 BST. Traders persisted with the risk rally of the past few sessions, fighting through mixed US economic data and the lurking presence of the eurozone debt crisis.The FTSE All-World equity index was up 1.4 per cent, and is set to record its sixth consecutive day of gains during which time it has risen nearly 6 per cent. Commodity prices are generally firmer.The euro resumed its drive higher, despite main sovereign and corporate credit default swap spreads for the region moving wider as investors remain wary about the continent’s financial health.The S&P 500 in New York was up 2.4 per cent, with its advance little affected by a downbeat report on US housebuilder sentiment.Instead, bulls were empowered by a tame inflation data point, as import prices fell 0.6 per cent in May, and a closely-watched barometer of industrial activity, the Empire State manufacturing survey, edging up in June. Energy shares also gained after executives defended the industry before Congress, and BP said it had allocated funds for covering some of its losses.“The market seems to be taking some comfort in BP’s announcement,” said analysts at Markit. ”If the …rally holds, this will only add fuel to the debate as to whether the markets have over-reached,” they said, as credit default swap spreads on BP continued to widen, while narrowing for Halliburton and Transocean.Investors also appeared somewhat inured over recent days to the niggling signs of stress related to the single currency bloc’s fiscal difficulties.For example, further talk about the problems Spanish institutions were having raising funds had been all but dismissed in the broader market, as optimists preferred to focus on the prospects for an improvement in global growth following recent good macroeconomic data out of Asia.Even Moody’s downgrading of Greece after the European close on Monday failed to hit a true nerve, undoing a rally on Monday, but clearly not holding shares back on Tuesday.Those analysts disappointed by the initial reaction to the rating agency’s move – many had hoped the market had discounted the fallout from the fiscal mess and was ready to move on – are likely to be pleased by the more phlegmatic approach witnessed on Tuesday.But over the slightly longer term, the consistent drip of negative budgetary news from the region is likely to prove debilitating.“We’ll take the gains, but as is our custom of late, leave the party hats in the box,” said John Stoltzfus, senior market strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.“It looks like a workout period with significant systemic and structural challenges [is] still in place, where two steps forward is often followed by one step back.”● Europe. Europe, which has outperformed Wall Street of late, was evidence of that lingering caution. Bourses fell at the open on disappointment that Wall Street overnight could not hold on to its gains, and by news that new passenger car sales in the European Union fell 9.3 per cent in May. Sentiment improved as the session wore on, partly prompted by some well-supported bond auctions from Spain, Ireland and Belgium, which marginally reduced concerns about the region’s funding needs, but still ultimately was restrained.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 0.7 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London was higher by 0.3 per cent. It was, however, the FTSE 100’s fifth day of gains, representing the best run since February, in spite of BP again proving a drag.● Forex. The rally in the euro – which had seen it advance 2.5 per cent in five sessions after bouncing off its cyclical lows last week – initially looked to be fading, as investors once again express concern about prospects for the eurozone. A weaker than forecast ZEW economic sentiment index was also a hindrance.However, the single currency, began to find its feet as the European session progressed following those auctions and ended the session up 1 per cent at $1.2350, closing just below its high point for June.Sterling slipped following news that inflation in the UK, while surprisingly sticky relative to international peers, fell more than forecast in May. The pound was down 0.5 per cent versus the euro at 83.33p, though it was up versus the US dollar, by 0.5 per cent, to $1.4818.The US dollar is down 0.8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Official data showed that foreign demand for US assets rose more than expected in April, a trend that one would think is likely to boost the dollar. However, the US unit tends these days to be driven more by its negative correlation to broader market risk appetite, hence the better mood is hurting the greenback.● Debt. Funds are moving out of Treasuries as equities gain traction. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was up 5 basis point at 3.30 per cent.In spite of the euro’s continued rally and those decent auctions, the bloc’s peripheral benchmark bond complex remains under pressure. The yield on 10-year Greek debt is up 99bp to 9.48 per cent. Spanish yields have reversed an early dip and are also moving higher again, up 2bp to 4.77 per cent, having earlier hit 4.78 per cent, the highest level since July 2008.● Commodities. Oil has been volatile as growth bulls and bears do battle. US-traded crude was up 2.6 per cent at $77.10 a barrel. Industrial metal prices are mainly higher and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB basket was up 1.4 per cent.Gold was up 1.2 per cent to $1,235 an ounce.● Asia. The cautious tone to the session was exemplified by a meagre 0.1 per cent rise for the FTSE Asia-Pacific index. With Shanghai again closed for a public holiday, trading was thin. Hong Kong added 0.3 per cent and Sydney fell just 0.01 per cent.The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo eked out a 0.1 per cent advance after the Bank of Japan unveiled its $33bn loan programme designed to boost targeted industries.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
881;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Fears over global economy hit sentiment;Euro and US Treasury yields hit fresh lows;Monday 21:10 BST. Risk asset investors think they may have lost their comforter. And they don’t like it. Not one bit.The FTSE All-World equity index was down 1.9 per cent to a fresh 10-month low. Gold, the world’s currency haven, saw its sharpest rise in nearly a month.While the euro bounced off fresh four-year lows, US markets followed the lead of Asian and European bourses and sold off sharply. The S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent to a new 2010 low. US Treasury yields were at 13-month lows.The cause of this latest caution seems clear. Throughout the period of recent market turmoil, caused primarily by worries over the impact of the eurozone’s fiscal difficulties, optimists have been able to use signs of improving underlying economic fundamentals as their security blanket.Sure, the austerity packages required to fix budget problems in Greece and others may crimp activity in the eurozone, but growth elsewhere was becoming sufficiently robust to ensure the world would not suffer a double-dip recession, they maintained.But after the disappointingly weak US jobs numbers on Friday, some are no longer so confident of that argument.“Specific fears about Europe and the banks have morphed into general fear,” said Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Collins Stewart in New York. “There’s no obvious resolution on the horizon for China’s slowdown, not for the US unemployment problem, or even the oil spill.”So markets were closely watching for concrete news of Europe’s near-term fiscal future. The message coming out of the G20 meeting over the weekend was that many developed-world governments, especially those of core Europe, believe they are too overextended to continue to support the recovery through stimulus.On Monday, 10-year French, Austrian and Belgian bond yields rose to one-year high spreads against benchmark German bunds. While Greek and Hungarian credit-default swap spreads narrowed, core Europe’s spreads widened out, according to Markit.News that Germany and France had late in the day agreed a eurozone rescue fund was offering some support for the single currency, but with Germany and the UK both announcing stiff austerity packages – David Cameron described it as an era of “pain” – investors are struggling to decide what the right balance is between fiscal clean-up and clamp-down.“Fiscal straightening out is necessary, but is the pace too aggressive?” said Sebastien Galy, strategist at BNP Paribas. “Nobody is sure yet.”● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index fell 3.3 per cent as traders in the region got the chance to react to concerns that growth in the US, their biggest export market, may be weaker than thought.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 3.8 per cent, with exporters also hurt by a jump in the yen. Tumbling commodity prices did for Sydney, where the S&P ASX 200 lost 2.8 per cent. Shanghai and Hong Kong dropped 1.6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, as the prospect of large fundraisings by Chinese banks also weighed on sentiment.● Europe. Bourses slumped at the open, partly tracking Wall Street’s 3.4 per cent stumble on Friday, though most are off worst levels. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 slid 0.9 per cent lower and London’s FTSE 100 was down 1.1 per cent, with resource stocks under pressure.Budapest stocks were down 0.5 per cent in spite of the government saying that in fiscal terms, Hungary is no Greece, attempting to backtrack from comments to the contrary made by high-ranking politicians last week. Athens was down 5.5 per cent.Though German industrial orders improved, Vincent Deluard, global equity strategist at TrimTabs, argued that any economic recovery could come under pressure after stimulus programmes like “cash for clunkers” in France and Italy, which has accelerated auto sales, expire.“These cuts are long overdue, but tighter fiscal policy in a number of countries stands to hammer aggregate demand,” said Mr Deluard. “We believe the European job market is more likely to worsen than improve in the near term.”● Forex. The euro continued to slide, hitting a fresh four-year low versus the dollar of $1.1878 in early Asian trading, as investors sought the perceived safety of the dollar and yen.However, worries about Hungary seemed to fade after German’s data showed industrial orders rising in April by more than expected, and the single currency ended now down 0.4 per cent at $1.1918. The Hungarian forint was up 0.8 per cent versus the euro after last week’s heavy falls, though it weakened toward the end of the session.The dollar index, which tracks the buck against a basket of its peers, rose 0.3 per cent to 88.50, just below its crisis high of 89.62 reached last April.Currencies that trade with a high positive correlation to growth prospects are struggling. The Aussie dollar, for example, is down 0.3 per cent versus the greenback.● Debt. The yield on US 10-year benchmark government bonds dropped to a 13-month low of 3.14 per cent, down 6bp. Trading was volatile ahead of $70bn in auctions later this week.Spanish and Italian 10-year yields are higher by 10 basis points to 4.68 per cent and 11 basis points to 4.35 per cent respectively as investors continue to fret about sovereign funding capabilities.A sale of €3.2bn in Belgian debt was poorly received, as 10-year bonds rose 9bp following the auction. Otis Casey, vice president at Markit, said that some were calling Belgium the “Greece of the North” following the auction, though he noted that CDS spreads narrowed throughout the day.● Commodities. Early selling in the complex, on worries about slower growth, seems to have moderated. Still, industrial metals are generally lower, led by copper, which is down 2.6 per cent in New York trading. Oil, meanwhile, is down 0.7 per cent to $71.02, after touching $72.50 – a gain of 1 per cent – earlier in the session.A sudden burst of buying in the New York morning has turned around gold’s fortunes. After trading lower for much of the global session, the precious metal is up 1.7 per cent at $1,240 an ounce, less than ten bucks short of its nominal high of $1,249 hit in May.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
882;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-06-03T11:16:23Z;Slowdown in new business hits services PMI;;The service sector saw new business rise at its slowest rate in nine months in May, raising fears about the strength and durability of the recovery.The purchasing managers’ index for services, a closely watched measure of industries that make up the largest part of the private sector, rose to a level of 55.4 from 55.3 in April. Any figure above 50 points to an increase in activity.But the still strong headline figure was undermined by a lower level of growth in new business, which fell to a level of 52.8 from 54.6 in April. New business has now slowed for three months in a row, and its level in May was the weakest since August 2009.Employment also cast a cloud over the report, with the jobs measure in the survey falling to 49.7 from 51.8 the previous month, and pointing to cuts in staffing for the first time since February.“Whilst on the surface the recovery of the UK services sector continued at a steady pace, a look under the bonnet reveals some worrying signs and raises concerns about the prospect of a double-dip recession,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which produces the report along with polling firm Markit.Paul Smith, economist at Markit, said: “The dominant service sector …remains on course to make a reasonable contribution to second-quarter GDP [gross domestic product]. However, the devil was in the detail, with weaker trends in new business and employment raising questions over the sector’s ability to maintain its current level of growth in the second-half of the year.”The absence of signs of more robust growth is also worrying because some services businesses had already been hit by the effects of the volcanic ash cloud in April.Companies reported that the weakness in new business and cuts in jobs came in part as price pressures started to push up costs. Input prices were still rising at a near-two-year high in May, according to the report, pushing up output prices for the second month in a row.It also reflected the election in May, which increased uncertainty about the political situation as well as fears about the durability of the recovery.The PMI survey of services covers the whole sector outside retail, wholesale and motor sales, and the government service sector.A CBI survey this week also pointed to a shaky recovery in services. Manufacturing appears to be experiencing a stronger pick-up, although it suffered a much deeper recession and is much smaller as a proportion of the UK economy.The services survey on Thursday “provides further evidence that the recovery in the biggest part of the economy is struggling to pick up pace,” said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics.
883;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-06-01T16:44:09Z;Industrial growth drives recovery hopes;;The UK manufacturing sector continued to rebound at a rapid pace in May and export orders jumped, according to a closely watched measure of industrial activity.The purchasing managers’ index remained at 58 last month, the same level it held in April. A figure above 50 points indicates an increase in business activity.The index is at its highest in more than 15 years and the sharp increases in April and May will raise expectations gross domestic product growth in the second quarter of this year should accelerate.“UK manufacturing maintained its blistering start to the second quarter,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, which produces the data. “Although production remains well below pre-recession levels, the sector is now recovering its losses at a surprisingly rapid pace.”The high level of the PMI is echoed by the pace of recovery in recent official data. Estimates by the Office for National Statistics point to annualised growth in manufacturing output of 7-8 per cent in the six months to March – close to what the PMI has been indicating, according to Goldman Sachs. However, manufacturing output in March was still more than 10 per cent below its pre-recession peak.New export orders remained close to record levels for the survey, while reports suggested that companies were rebuilding inventories, which should further support growth in the short term.Companies also cut inventories sharply in May, suggesting that the boost to output was not simply because businesses have depleted stocks. “It looks as if inventories fell rapidly in May,” said Neville Hill, economist at Credit Suisse. “That suggests companies are being surprised by the strength of demand and are being forced to cut their inventory accordingly.”Employment rose for the second month in a row and the fourth in the past five, after about two years of cuts in jobs.But there were some dark clouds on the horizon. Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which carry out the survey, warned that the eurozone crisis could hit demand for exports, and the impending cuts in public spending were also likely to damage the recovery.“Austerity measures announced in the UK may cool home demand, while export sales may be hit by the sovereign debt crisis in our largest trading partner, the eurozone,” said Mr Dobson.Meanwhile, costs appear to be rising more quickly. Input and output prices rose at their fastest rate since late summer 2008, when oil and other commodity prices were near record highs.Other data for the second quarter has been mixed. A CBI employers’ group survey of retail in May was weak, and consumer confidence also dipped in the month, but the PMI for the service sector looked generally buoyant in April.While consumer spending has looked damper this year, business spending picked up rapidly in the first quarter, with investment up by 6 per cent.The Bank of England central forecast is for 0.8 per cent growth in the second quarter, after the ONS reported 0.3 per cent growth in the first.
884;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-05-27T21:52:17Z;Euro’s rebound helps to boost stocks;Easing of credit worries trump fears over eurozone;"Thursday 21:35 BST. A rebounding euro and an ease in credit conditions has let loose animal spirits, allowing hopes for a broader global economic recovery to trump lingering fears about the eurozone.The FTSE All-World equity index was up 3.2 per cent, commodities prices are higher and high-yielding currencies are seeing a bid. The dollar and benchmark US Treasuries had their sharpest corrections of the year.A turnaround in the euro was a key element in improving sentiment, as global markets shrugged off a late-session reversal on Wall Street on Wednesday. After tumbling on that day following a report in the Financial Times that China was reviewing its holdings of eurozone debt, the euro began to climb again in early Asian trading on Thursday when Chinese government officials said that Beijing’s foreign exchange policy would continue to include the purchase of euro assets.The US dollar Libor rate – a key gauge of inter-bank lending risk – was unchanged overnight for the first time after three weeks of widening. The swap spread – measuring credit risk over Treasuries – also eased off its high.One closely watched bank, Spain’s BBVA, said that it was able to secure alternative financing, after reports on Wednesday that it was having difficulty renewing some of its short-term dollar-denominated debt, according to currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman.The Markit indices of European high-yield and bank credit default swaps were both tighter. Spreads on debt of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were in both cases also 20bp narrower.Analysts at BNP Paribas said the credit markets were slowly shifting out of “panic mode” – citing in particular the low bid for dollars by banks at the European Central Bank’s auction on Tuesday – but would still be subject to similar headline risks for some time.""The wave of fear about a possible scarcity of dollar funding has lost momentum,” said Cyril Beuzit, global head of interest rate strategy at BNPP. “[But] the market will remain sensitive to liquidity news, keeping in mind that liquidity conditions in the euro area are, and will remain, excessive for some time.”Wall Street is embracing the global trend and was up 3.3 per cent. The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 16 per cent to just under 30, having just last week hit a year’s high of 48.”No question this is a significant move,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. He noted that stocks were now nearly 5 per cent above their 200-day moving average, a key barrier suggesting a turnaround in sentiment.“It’s possible we’ve reached the end of the euro news thread, and next week’s US job numbers will take the market’s mind off Europe,” said Mr Ablin.News that the South Korean and Kuwaiti central banks also have no plans to cut euro holdings has given the single currency another leg-up.Meanwhile, investors can also note further signs of improving economic fundamentals bubbling below the surface. US durable goods orders and new home sales on Wednesday provided positive surprises and on Thursday Japan registered its fifth consecutive month of export growth, pointing to improved global demand.It should be noted, though, that the drop in US weekly jobless claims again disappointed and first-quarter GDP was revised lower.● Forex. The dollar was in retreat following its strong run of recent weeks. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, was off 1 per cent at 86.26 – its sharpest move, in percentage terms, since November 2009.The single currency was up 1.5 per cent versus the dollar at $1.2361 and up 2.7 per cent against the yen to Y112.42.Commodity currencies also rallied as risk-lovers returned to the carry trade. The Australian dollar was up 3.7 per cent versus the US buck, at $0.8515. The New Zealand dollar rose 2.9 per cent, and the Canadian loonie was 1.8 per cent higher. The Japanese yen, meanwhile, dipped 1 per cent against the dollar, to Y90.85.Sterling rose 1.3 per cent versus the dollar at $1.4574 on rumours that Prudential, the UK insurer, may be dropping its $36bn bid for AIA – a move that would have seen the Pru sell sterling to pay for its acquisition.● Europe. Bourses are tracking US equities and the euro. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is up 2.9 per cent and London’s FTSE 100 soared 3.1 per cent, with banks enjoying the improved sentiment towards Europe and miners benefiting from the dollar-induced bounce for commodities. A sharp rise in BP shares, on hopes the oil giant can plug the Gulf of Mexico leak, added extra impetus.● Debt. The US 10-year bond, considered the global sovereign debt haven benchmark, saw selling as traders sought riskier bets elsewhere, its yield rose 16 basis points to 3.33 per cent – the sharpest percentage jump in yield since June 2009.An auction of $31bn of new seven-year notes resulted in a yield of 1bp above the market rate. Seven-year notes in later trading were 12bp higher at 2.77 per cent.That follows poorly bid auctions for US two-year and five-year debts, as well as the cancelled German bund auction.“Auction performance suggests that the correction we’ve had over the last month has left Treasury yields at levels too low to be attractive to the market,” said Anshul Pradhan, fixed-income research analyst at Barclays.“Risk aversion metrics have declined from the highs, and yields are off their lows. Whether that can be sustained is unclear, as inflation data has weakened quite a bit.”Greek 10-year bond yields have dipped below 8 per cent, but Spanish benchmarks are up 1 basis point to 4.27 per cent after Madrid lawmakers only just passed the government’s austerity package.● Commodities. Oil was up 4.5 per cent to $74.73, surging due to warnings of a violent hurricane season. Copper climbed 3 per cent to $3.17 as global growth trades are put back on the table.Gold was flat at $1,211 an ounce.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 2 per cent as the region’s stocks continue to bounce off Tuesday’s 10-month low. Tokyo rose 1.2 per cent as the yen weakened against the euro, boosting export stocks. Sydney added 1.7 per cent on a rebound in mining stocks as investors speculated that Canberra would soften a proposed resources tax.Shanghai and Hong Kong each added 1.2 per cent.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm"
885;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-05-24T02:34:11Z;Six banks pledge dark pool disclosure;;Six banks operating a form of trading platform known as a “ dark pool” in Europe are from Monday to publicise daily volumes, country-by-country, in a further sign of moves to shed more light on what happens in such venues amid heightened regulatory scrutiny.Markit, the market data company, said the six banks - Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley and UBS – will report the volumes of cash equity trades crossed in their automated crossing systems via a service provided by Markit.At the end of each trading day Markit will collate the data from each bank, conduct “validation checks” on the information and publish the aggregated trading volumes the following afternoon.However the data does not break out volumes by crossing network, only country-by-country.The data will cover automated trades only, including trades matched on systems such as Citi Match, CS Crossfinder, DBA, JPM-X, MSPool and UBS PIN.The data will include trading between clients of the executing broker and trading between brokers and their clients. Volumes will be published on an aggregated basis and will be broken down by country.The system has been in a test period for the past two weks, during which time the daily percentage of trades reported in this way has ranged from 0.62-1.02 per cent of all European trading.John Serocold of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, the trade association for securities firms in Europe, said: “This initiative is designed to bring further transparency into this area of OTC [over-the-counter] trading by providing verified data where previously there has been only speculation, and by giving a clear indication of the actual levels of trading in crossing engines.”Afme was formed last year from a merger of the London Investment Banking Association and the European arm of the US-based Securities and Financial Markets Association.The move comes as regulators are scrutinising bank-run dark pools as part of a review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) .Nomura in December launched the first bank-owned dark pool in Europe to reveal publicly what trades have been done in a bid to “remove the mystery” from such trading facilities.Credit Suisse in January became the first bank to reveal the value of trading in its existing Europe “dark pool”, with Citi following soon afterwards.Dark pools are off-exchange facilities that allow trading of large blocks of shares, with prices posted publicly only after trades are done. Their popularity has grown because electronic trading has caused the average size of orders on exchanges to fall. Traders placing large orders run the risk that this signals they are a large buyer or seller – prompting the market to move against them and jeopardising the order.Dark pools fall into three categories: those operated by exchanges, by independent companies or by banks. Banks refer to theirs as “crossing networks”.
886;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
887;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-05-06T21:35:37Z;New York pulls back from turmoil;;The “flight to safety” in global markets on Thursday reached a peak during late trade in New York, with Wall Street dropping about 9 per cent at one point, before the bulk of the losses were pared.Volatility across equities, bonds and currencies surged to levels last seen during the worst of the financial crisis as investors fled risky assets. Traders blamed computer-based selling once the S&P 500 fell below the key level of 1,120.“There was a capitulation today: people panicked and just started selling,” said James Sarni, managing principal, Payden & Rygel.At one point in trading the S&P dropped as much as 8.6 per cent to 1,065.79, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 998.50 points, or 9.2 per cent. Gold surged above $1,200 an ounce, oil dropped more than $5 a barrel to below $75 a barrel, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 26 basis points to 3.28 per cent, while the yen soared by 6 per cent versus the dollar and 8 per cent against the euro.“It feels like someone made a large mistake in selling stock that exacerbated the trade in bonds,” said Tom di Galoma, head of trading at Guggenheim Partners. “In my 25 years in the business I have never seen bonds have that type of move in a 20-minute period.”Mark Benigno, managing partner at New York oil options dealer Hudson Capital Energy, said: “Oil and stocks are correlated to the same thing. When you saw the stock market rip lower, people just chose to let go of their holdings.”At the close in New York, the S&P was down 3.3 per cent, with the Vix, a measure of S&P volatility, up 40 per cent at 35, while the 10-year yield was at 3.38 per cent, down 17bps on the day.The febrile atmosphere came after European markets had closed and the European Central Bank had done little to halt the erosion of investor confidence fuelled by sovereign debt fears. “The negative feedback loop between states and their banking sectors has re-emerged and is having a seismic impact on the broader market,” said Gavan Nolan, credit strategist at Markit.The key focus for investors was the press conference following the European Central Bank’s policy meeting.Many in the markets had hoped to see signals that the ECB would undertake further unconventional policy support to offset the impact of fiscal tightening.But Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said that purchases of government bonds had not been discussed at the meeting, and he gave no indication that further measures to boost lending would be introduced.“Policymakers are still unconvinced about the scale and seriousness of the debt crisis hitting the periphery,” said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at RBS.Meanwhile, demand at Spain’s auction of five-year bonds was solid – although the yield pushed up sharply, highlighting concerns about rising financing costs for weaker eurozone members.Credit spreads – both sovereign and corporate – offered a telling indication of the seriousness of the situation as Greek and Spanish CDS also widened sharply.The Markit iTraxx SovX index of 10 western European sovereign credits widened to a record 168bp – 46bp above the iTraxx Europe index of investment-grade corporate credits.Greek, Portuguese and Spanish government bond yields continued to push higher, with the yield spread of Portuguese and Spanish 10-year paper over German Bunds hitting record wides.The flight away from peripheral Europe boosted core German and US government bonds. The yields on the 10-year Bund and two-year Schatz both hit record lows, of 0.49 per cent and 2.78 per cent respectively.Equity prices were hit by the broad shift away from risky assets. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo dropped 3.3 per cent, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 slid 1.5 per cent as UK voters went to the polls. Brazil’s stocks fell 3 per cent as emerging markets were also hit hard by risk aversion.Additional reporting by Greg Meyer, Nicole Bullock and Telis Demos.
888;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Volcanic ash takes its toll on UK economy;;Growth in the services sector slowed in April as the volcanic ash cloud cast a shadow over British businesses, according to a closely watched index published on Thursday.The purchasing managers index for services dropped to 55.3 from 56.5 in March, where any reading above 50 indicates an increase in activity.Leaving aside January’s dip after heavy snow and a rise in VAT, it was the weakest month for growth since last September.Markit, who produce the data, said that the majority of the drop could be blamed on the decline in activity when volcanic ash cloud shut down flights into and out of the UK for six days last month. The transport, storage and communications sub-sector recorded the weakest growth of any services industry.However, this is the second consecutive month that activity has increased at a slower pace, and the figures will raise fears for the incoming government about the strength of the recovery.“A slowdown in service sector growth shows that it wasn’t just planes that were grounded by the volcanic ash in April,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply. “Business operations and supply chains were heavily impacted by the shutdown of air travel, which led to a marked drop in growth.”“An easing in the rate of expansion compared to March will raise some concerns about the durability of the upturn,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit.But businesses taking part in the survey pointed to the ash cloud, the election and an early Easter as reasons for why activity grew less robustly in April.“Just like the impact of the heavy snow in January, this is only likely to be a temporary blip,” said Mr Noble.Other aspects of the report were more positive. While growth slowed, the index still suggested that the sector had expanded in April for the 12th month in a row. Growth in activity last month was close to its long term average, in spite of the volcanic interlude.Companies were also hiring again for the second month in a row, and at the fastest pace in two years, with the index for employment rising to 51.8 from 50.3 in March.Input prices rose more quickly – at their fastest since September 2008 – but prices charged barely increased.“One note of caution must be the inflation that seems to be lurking within the services sector,” said Mr Noble. He said that competition was stopping businesses from passing on rising input costs to their customers. “This situation cannot last forever and we will soon reach a tipping point where profit margins can no longer be squeezed and output prices have to rise.”The data comes after robust figures for the manufacturing purchasing managers index, which pointed to the fastest growth in the sector since 1994, albeit after a punishing recession. Capital Economics said that combining the service sector data with figures from the manufacturing and construction PMI surveys suggested that quarterly gross domestic product growth was close to 0.7 per cent.
889;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-05-05T22:25:54Z;Building activity jumps;;Builders have experienced the sharpest jump in activity in almost three years as demand for new housing and offices continues to gather momentum.Last month construction companies saw workloads across the sector increase from 53.1 in March to 58.2, according to the construction purchasing managers index. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion.Residential construction, which has contracted by about 40 per cent since the start of the recession, showed the strongest rise in activity, adding to recent expectations of a recovery in the housing market.Demand for new homes has been among the worst hit areas of the building industry, as limited finance and a lack of buyer confidence has caused new housing projects to plummet.But housebuilders have recently reported a strong improvement in both forward sales and buyer interest and many are forecasting a period of steady growth.Indeed, last week Taylor Wimpey, the second-biggest homebuilder by volume, said that its prices increased about 9 per cent in the first four months of the year and that it had achieved close to three-quarters of its sales target for 2010.David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, which produces the construction PMI with Markit, said: “It’s encouraging to see the construction sector show signs of recuperation for the second month running and suggests that the whole UK economic recovery has real substance.”Commercial construction also expanded during April, posting its second consecutive month of growth. Meanwhile, civil engineering and work on big infrastructure projects such as hospitals, roads and railways, declined during the month, albeit at the slowest rate in almost two years.However, unemployment in the building sector – the largest contributor to redundancies during the recession – continued to rise as companies looked to protect wearied finances and improve efficiency.The Construction Products Association, the industry’s main trade body, said the data were encouraging but warned that there could still be pain to come for building groups.“Construction faces a difficult year in 2010 because we expect to see a continued fall in private sector investment at a time when the recent boom in publicly funded work is slowing,” said Michael Ankers, chief executive of the CPA.The CPA’s latest forecasts indicate a further 3 per cent decline in overall construction activity during 2010, followed by a slight pick-up in 2011. But the group said it was unlikely that pre-recession levels of activity would be seen before 2017.
890;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-05-03T23:43:55Z;Cost of Goldman debt insurance soars;;The cost of insuring Goldman Sachs’ debt against default has risen to about the level of Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, two less profitable rivals,as Goldman’s regulatory woes take a toll on investors’ confidence and its standing on Wall Street.The risk ascribed to the bank by the derivatives markets has risen sharply following US regulators’ filing of civil fraud charges against Goldman last month.The cost of insuring $10m of Goldman’s debt using a five-year credit default swap (CDS) is $162,000 a year, according to Markit, an 80 per cent rise from the level before the charges were announced.Goldman’s CDSs now trade at the same level as those of Morgan Stanley, which emerged from the financial crisis in worse shape, and just below CDSs on Citi, which had to be bailed out by the US government.On April 15, the day before the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint against Goldman, it cost about $30,000 less annually to insure the debt of Goldman than Citi’s or Morgan Stanley’s. The CDSs of Goldman and Morgan Stanley have not traded at the same level since October 2007, Markit data show.At the height of the credit crisis in autumn 2008, the cost of default protection on all banks soared to levels far exceeding yesterday’s levels. As the capital markets calmed and Goldman prospered, the cost of insuring against its default was typically lower than Citi and Morgan Stanley.Goldman, which denies the SEC’s charges, declined to comment yesterday.Separately, Goldman yesterday revealed it had been hit by several lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders since the SEC’s charges. In a regulatory filing, Goldman said the bank, its executives and directors faced seven legal actions related to the bank’s mortgage-related trading activities.The lawsuits allege “breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, abuse of control, mismanagement and unjust enrichment”, the filing said.Goldman’s disclosure of the lawsuits contrasts with its decision not to reveal to shareholders the SEC’s formal warning in July that it intended to press civil charges. Some of the investors’ legal actions claim the directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by failing to police Goldman’s mortgage-trading desk and not revealing the SEC’s probe.
891;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-29T22:00:45Z;Confidence returns as Greek debt fears decline;;A more confident mood swept through global markets as sovereign debt concerns came off the boil amid growing optimism that a rescue deal for Greece could be imminent.US shares had their sharpest gain since early March. Support came from positive economic and earnings releases, plus the Federal Reserve’s reassurance on Wednesday that US interest rates would remain low for the time being.But the focus remained firmly on the eurozone debt crisis following credit ratings downgrades for Greece, Portugal and Spain within the past two days.Reports suggested Greek negotiations for a support package from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund would be concluded this weekend. Germany’s parliament is due to debate a Greek loan next week.But many analysts remained sceptical.“The capacity for participants in the Greek/EU/IMF bail-out to shoot themselves in the foot, and then repeat the exercise, should on recent evidence not be underestimated,” said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets.Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit, added: “There are serious concerns surrounding Greece, namely execution risk on the bail-out, possible debt restructurings, and whether the Greek public will accept the even more austere measures that are likely to be demanded by the IMF.”Nevertheless, Greek and other peripheral eurozone government bond prices rose on Thursday and the cost of insuring against sovereign debt default fell sharply.The yield spread of Greek 10-year bonds over German Bunds – the premium demanded by investors to hold Greek debt – narrowed 50 basis points to 750bp. Spanish and Portuguese yield premia over Bunds also narrowed.The 10-year German Bund yield inched up 1bp to 3.01 per cent while the 10-year US Treasury yield was down 3bp at 3.73 per cent after a well-bid sale of seven-year paper, the final in a series of $129bn of auctions.Greece’s five-year credit default swap plunged 184bp to 625bp, according to data from Markit. Portugal’s CDS fell by 19bp to 308bp and Spain’s by 13bp to 176bp.On the currency markets, the euro rallied off a one-year low against the dollar and pulled back above the $1.32 level.Support for the single currency also came from an improvement in the European Commission’s business and consumer surveys in April, and a fifth successive monthly fall in German unemployment.Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said: “The big risk, of course, is that the improvement in sentiment will reverse once the fiscal squeeze tightens and widens.”In the US, weekly jobless claims data appeared to confirm that the labour market was improving only gradually, offering some justification for the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain its pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period”.Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said: “A bland US FOMC statement at the latest meeting does not rule out a substantial change in text and market reaction at the June 23 meeting.”However, he said the events in Europe of the past few days had raised the risk of contagion across the Atlantic. “We should not assume that events in Greece will remain solely European in nature.”But for Thursday at least the bulls were firmly back in charge of US and European equity markets as corporate earnings supported a broadly rosy view of the global recovery.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.3 per cent, while in Europe, the Eurofirst 300 index climbed 1.3 per cent.Tokyo was closed for a holiday but Shanghai remained on the back foot as it declined for a sixth successive session.The Vix volatility index shed another 11 per cent to take it back below 19, its steepest one-day drop since February 2009.In commodities, gold was in focus as it hovered near a 2010 high. The metal was trading at $1,167 an ounce, down from Wednesday’s peak of $1,174.18 but steady on the day. US crude oil climbed $2.09 to $85.31 a barrel, a monthly high, although copper eased back.
892;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-25T07:27:37Z;Markit launches global ETF database;;"Exchange traded fund users are about to get a new reference bible, courtesy of Markit, a financial information provider.Markit, which is owned by a consortium of financial services players, will this week launch a global ETF database, offering more than 300 pieces of information per product. At the end of March, there were 2,721 products on 43 exchanges around the world.“It’s a very fast-growing market and we feel it could benefit from a stronger infrastructure,"" said Niall Cameron, executive vice-president at Markit. “This is a fairly forensic database of ETFs – it gives users a one-stop shop.”The information will cover all exchange traded products – commodities, notes, special investment vehicles – not just funds.The industry has welcomed the initiative, said Mr Cameron. The service will rely on information being given to Markit by the product providers, but so far this has not posed a problem. “Providers have been very forthcoming with their data,” said Bernie Thurston, a director of equities at Markit.Future regulatory updates could make even more information available, if European ETF trade-reporting becomes mandatory under the next iteration of Mifid, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive."
893;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-22T09:59:19Z;Eurozone manufacturing powers ahead;;Eurozone manufacturers are expanding production at the highest pace for a decade, according to a closely watched survey that shows industry reaping the benefits of the euro’s Greece-related slide.April’s purchasing managers’ surveys showed the 16-country zone’s recovery firmly on track. Growth is being powered by manufacturing companies, which are benefiting from a strong pick-up in demand from emerging economies as well as the weaker currency.German manufacturers expanded production this month at the fastest since the survey began in 1996. But growth in the eurozone service sector also accelerated.The results highlight the silver lining to the crisis over Greece’s public finances, which has fuelled fears about the stability of Europe’s 11-year-old monetary union. Since early December, the euro has fallen about 8 per cent on trade-weighted basis.They also suggest that the pace of the overall economic recovery is accelerating. First-quarter eurozone gross domestic product figures, due for release next month, were hit by the exceptionally bitter winter especially in Germany, where GDP might even have contracted.The latest purchasing managers’ indices, however, suggested the rise in second-quarter GDP compared with the previous three months could easily exceed 0.4 per cent, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the surveys. “Manufacturers are showing the best performance for 10 years,” he said.However, the recovery in the eurozone is still expected to lag behind the world’s other main regions. International Monetary Fund forecasts this week showed the global economy growing 4.2 per cent in 2010 and the US economy 3.1 per cent. But the Washington-based forecasters expected only 1 per cent in the eurozone, where prospects have been dragged down by the weaker southern European countries, including Spain and Greece.Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: “We are still a long way from normal economic conditions.”The eurozone would probably not return to pre-crisis production levels until the end of 2012, he said, and would “have to battle with mass unemployment for some years yet”.Meanwhile, fears about a pick-up in inflation pressures could mount after the purchasing managers’ survey showed bottlenecks forming in eurozone manufacturing and rising input costs resulting from the weaker euro. But with eurozone inflation, at 1.4 per cent, still well below the European Central Bank’s target of an annual rate “below but close to” 2 per cent, no early rise in interest rates is expected.The purchasing managers’ indices are regarded as good up-to-date indicators of trends in private sector activity. The composite eurozone index, covering manufacturing and service sectors, rose from 55.9 in March to 57.3. With a figure over 50 representing an expansion in activity, that was the fastest increase since August 2007.The eurozone manufacturing index jumped from 56.6 in March to 57.5, the highest since June 2006. The German manufacturing index rose from 60.2 to a record 61.3.
894;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greek worries shake resilient mood;;Financial markets were caught in a two-way pull on Wednesday as resurgent fears about sovereign debt default vied with mounting evidence of US corporate strength.While no clear winner emerged on the day, there was little doubt that heightened concerns over Greece’s financial position – as evidenced by a sharp rise in Greek bond yields – had shaken the resilient mood seen in global markets this week.“Greek yields continue to drift out alarmingly,” said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS. “The situation is yet to be contained and remains the number one risk factor for global markets.”The latest turbulence in Greek bonds came as Athens began talks with European and International Monetary Fund officials over an emergency aid package. There was a widespread view that Greece could trigger the aid mechanism sooner rather than later.“Current market yields imply that it is a matter of when and not if the package will be activated,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit.The yield on the Greek 10-year government bond climbed past 8 per cent to its highest for 12 years, taking the spread over German Bunds above 500 basis points.The cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign debt default, as measured by five-year credit default swaps, reached a record wide of 495bp before easing back.And there were signs of growing concerns about contagion from Greece spreading to other peripheral eurozone nations. Portugal’s five-year CDS moved to within striking distance of the record 245bp seen in February, and Spanish spreads also widened.But Mr Gibbs at RBS said contagion was occurring without getting out of control.“Basically, global recovery and generally upbeat sentiment in global markets is working to keep what is a very troubling situation from spreading,” he said.Meanwhile, the US Treasury yield curve continued to flatten as speculation continued that a Federal Reserve rate rise might come sooner than many in the markets had been anticipating – particularly after the Bank of Canada signalled on Tuesday that it might tighten as early as June.The yield on the two-year note fell 1bp to a flat 1.00 per cent while the 30-year fell 6bp to 4.61 per cent.The default concerns were a key driver of moves in the currency markets. The euro dropped below $1.34 – extending its recent weakness against the dollar – and also lost ground against the yen and pound.“The market is losing confidence in the prospect for Greece, which should weigh on the euro,” said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital. “In addition, near-term rallies should be limited by ongoing fears over the impact of the EU weaker states generally.”Commodity prices were volatile, moving alongside equities.Base metals suffered a broad decline, with copper finishing up 0.3 per cent, while the US oil price ended flat at $83.84 a barrel after spending much of the day in the red after an unexpected rise in crude inventories last week.Gold was 0.6 per cent higher as Greek worries offset the dollar’s firmer tone.But the concerns about the eurozone had relatively little impact on US equities, as the focus remained firmly on the quarterly reporting season.Sparkling figures from Apple, released after the close of trade on Tuesday, provided a strong boost to global stocks, particularly in Asia. And encouraging results on Wednesday from Morgan Stanley and Boeing offered further reasons for optimism about the global recovery.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 per cent and Shanghai recorded its biggest one-day rise for three weeks. Europe fared poorly, as hefty losses for banks – largely on the back of the latest worries about Greece – drove the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index down 0.7 per cent.The Vix US equity volatility index – closely watched by the markets as a measure of risk aversion – rose 4.8 per cent to 16.48, but remained within easy striking distance of the near three-year low struck last week.

896;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-19T12:21:17Z;Advertisers now more willing to spend money;;Confidence has returned to a majority of UK advertisers for the first time since 2007, according to a survey regarded as an indicator for the wider economy as well as the advertising industry.In the quarterly report for the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising by BDO, some 21 per cent of marketing directors surveyed reported they had increased their advertising budget in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 16 per cent who had cut it.A total of 36 per cent plan to raise their spending in the new financial year, compared with 24 per cent who have again reduced their budgets after the worst advertising recession for decades.Although the recovery remains modest, the news marks the first uptick in overall confidence recorded by the IPA/BDO bellwether report since the third quarter of 2007.“This is very encouraging news for the UK economy as it suggests that companies are at last beginning to increase their spending and move away from the aggressive cost control measures which characterised the recession,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, who wrote the report.“This is a necessary ingredient of a more sustainable recovery and bodes well for economic growth in coming quarters.”Internet advertising spending had begun to resume growth nine months ago, but traditional media budgets have also now been revised upwards for the first time in 10 quarters. Sales promotion and direct marketing is yet to see any real improvement.“It’s good to see that businesses are now increasing their investment in marketing as a route to growth – a welcome change in sentiment compared to this time last year,” said Rory Sutherland, IPA president and vice-chairman of Ogilvy Group UK, the advertising agency.“While online activities are leading the turnaround this year, the findings show that conventional advertising has now also turned the corner.”Asked about their views on the outlook for their companies generally as well as the marketing industry, those surveyed reported a continued improvement in confidence that began in the middle of last year. Around 31 per cent of marketing executives were more optimistic about growth in the media sector, while 24 per cent were more sceptical.Around 42 per cent were more optimistic about their own company’s financial prospects than they were at the end of 2009.“These results are a clear sign that renewed business confidence is translating into real budget increases and tangible economic recovery,” said Andy Viner, head of media at BDO.“The last three quarters saw an increase in optimism without an increase in spending, but the survey shows that marketing budgets have been revised up for the first time in two-and-a- half years so that they have finally caught up with business confidence.”Search engine advertising remains the most dynamic part of the ad market. Analysts at Enders, a media research firm, said last week that they were likely to raise their forecasts for advertising spending with Google in the UK after the search engine company’s results last week were better than expected.
897;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-07T17:59:10Z;Venezuela heads debt default risk list;;Venezuela has topped a list of the most risky sovereign borrowers, with Lithuania, Lebanon and Romania dropping out of the top 10 riskiest nations to be replaced by Pakistan, Egypt and Iraq.The report by CMA Datavision is based on the default risk of countries as determined by the price at which their credit default swaps trade in the market. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, the data provider estimated Venezuela had a 48.5 per cent chance of default over the next five years, while Greece which ranked 9th, had a 25.4 per cent probability.On Wednesday, worries around Greece pushed up the cost of protection against default on its bonds above that of Iceland for the first time, according to data provider Markit.“It is not a surprise that Venezuela tops the list,” said Nigel Rendell, senior emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “What is surprising is that western European countries like Greece and Iceland are now in the top 10. It is a reminder that these regions do have sovereign risk and that just because a country is ‘developed’ does not mean that circumstances cannot change drastically.”Jerome Booth, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, thinks the markets are starting to price in the underlying default risk of developed nations. He believes Greece has a greater default risk than Venezuela and expects CDS markets will start to price in a greater risk of default for Greece.Norway led the list of safest sovereign borrowers. The US fell three spots to rank as the 10th safest sovereign borrower. Analysts at CMA said in the report that spreads on US CDS had increased slightly since the successful passing of the healthcare bill, which commits the government to significant financial investment in health infrastructure and services.But the UK failed to make the top 10 of the safest sovereign nations. It ranked 21st with a probability of default of 6.7 per cent, according to CMA.Globally, Portugal saw the greatest deterioration in its creditworthiness as determined in CDS markets over the past quarter.However, some analysts cautioned against reading too much into the data.“While I would agree with the ordering of the countries in the top 10, there are other countries that are far more likely to default than Greece that do not appear in the top 10,” said Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citi.“The implied probabilities of default over the next five-year period, however, are overstated – a 25 per cent chance of Greece defaulting, close to that of Iraq, is ludicrous. It is a useful report, but it reflects the fact that financial markets are driven by nervous investors who invariably over-react in one direction or another.”
898;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-07T11:15:25Z;Eurozone recovery stalled at end of last year;;The eurozone economic recovery stalled at the end of last year, according to revised official figures showing the 16-country region performed worse than previously reported.Gross domestic product was unchanged in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three months, said Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office. Previously, it had reported a 0.1 per cent increase.The latest revision highlighted the lacklustre rebound experienced by continental Europe, with domestic demand hit by the phasing out of government emergency support measures.In contrast, the US economy proved far more dynamic in the three final months of 2009, when the country saw a 1.4 per cent rise in GDP. The UK escaped from recession later than the eurozone, but also notched up a better performance in the fourth quarter, reporting an 0.4 per cent rise in GDP.However, signs have emerged of a substantial improvement since the start of this year. Concerns about the eurozone have focused recently on the weakness of its southern European members – especially Greece, which has been hit by a crisis over its public finances. But the latest economic indicators suggest that the first quarter of 2010 saw robust growth, with eurozone manufacturers helped by the pick-up in the global economy and the fall in the euro that has been caused by the Greek crisis.Revised purchasing managers’ indices for March showed private sector economic activity expanding at the fastest rate since August 2007. The “composite” index, covering manufacturing and services, rose from 53.7 in February to 55.9 – indicating the eight consecutive month of growth.The latest readings were consistent with GDP rising by between 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, according to Markit, which produces the survey. The weak final quarter of 2009 appeared “more a temporary blip than a reversal of fortunes”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.He added: “There are also signs that growth is becoming better balanced, which should help build a basis for a more sustainable recovery. Although still led by manufacturing, especially in Germany, services growth picked up to the strongest since late 2007.”The strong purchasing managers’ indices will ease worries that the bitter winter had put the recovery on hold.
899;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-04-01T10:26:04Z;Manufacturing sector bounces back;;UK manufacturing output in March rose at its fastest pace since 1994, according to a closely watched index, with companies reporting solid demand from both domestic and overseas customers.The purchasing managers’ index compiled by CIPS/Markit Manufacturing showed a headline reading of 57.2, up from 56.5 in February and the highest reading since October 1994.David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: “To see such a fast-paced recovery in the manufacturing sector is hugely encouraging. Exports are clearly a main driver of growth but we are also seeing recovery across the whole sector.”Mr Noble said the strongest growth came among companies in the intermediate goods sector, but that expansion appeared to be broad-based.“However, even at this level of bounce-back, there is still a long way to go before manufacturing returns to pre-recession levels,” he added.The latest readings for the UK come along side strong growth in eurozone manufacturing. A similar survey earlier on Thursday from CIPS/Markit for the eurozone showed manufacturing output at its fastest pace since November 2006, led by Germany and France.All Europe’s major economies reported further expansion in their industrial output, many of them at record levels. The only country to reduce output was Greece, which is currently battling a fiscal crisis. The strong figures are partly due to the sharpest rise in new export orders since April 2000.Managers at the 3,000 European companies polled said the bounce was on the back of global recovery, they also cited relative weakness in the euro – down 6 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year – as a factor.Neville Hill, economist at Credit Suisse, noted that within the UK index, the output component jumped strongly in the month to 61.88, the first time it has registered a higher reading than 60 since 1994 when Britain was emerging from a recession and enjoying the benefits of a sterling devaluation.Mr Hill noted that that component has historically correlated best with gross domestic product.However, there were signs of some weaknesses. Employment, for example, fell back in March to 49.20. A reading below 50 suggests a contraction while readings above that level suggest growth.Moreover, the index points to rising price pressures that economists believe the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee will feel compelled to address. The average input prices component registered 68.08 and rose at the quickest rate since September 2008. There were reports of higher prices for chemicals, food, oil, timber and utilities.Output prices also rose, registering 55.26, suggesting that manufacturers are now passing on costs to customers. Mr Hill said that the key headline and prices readings on the PMI Index are historically correlated with strong rises in interest rates.“In our view, this combination of strong growth and rising prices is not one that can sit comfortably for long with policy rates at just 0.5 per cent,” Mr Hill said.
900;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit plans scores for trade rating;;Investors will have new tools to assess the trade-ability of their holdings in corporate bonds and credit default swaps following the launch of “liquidity scores” by Markit, the financial data provider.The move comes as regulators are forcing traders and investors to pay more attention to liquidity following the severe problems caused by the freezing of various credit markets during the financial crisis.Markit will score bonds and CDS on a scale of one to five, with five being the least liquid (based on the spread between the bid and offer prices, the number of dealers who have provided the data and the number of price points it has been given).The scores are new for the corporate bond world but other providers produce something similar for CDS.Markit will also provide liquidity measures for the 6,500 loans that it offers pricing data on and is looking at developing a similar score for European asset-backed securities.The score will indicate liquidity relative to other securities in that asset class but it will not be possible to consider a bond and a CDS contract with the same score as equally liquid, owing to the different trading conditions of those markets. The measures are expected to prove popular with investors and product control teams in banks, who can use the data to challenge traders’ prices.“Irrespective of regulation, banks and ‘buy’ side companies are seeking better views of liquidity for managing risk and their portfolio,” said David Austin, director of the credit products group at Markit, who said clients had shown interest in the new scores.
901;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-25T18:51:14Z;Japan auctions $1.3bn worth of Aiful CDS;;Japan held Asia’s first credit event auction on Thursday to clear up an estimated $1.3bn worth of credit default swaps from Aiful, a consumer finance company.The event looks set to act as a precedent for future settlements, including recently bankrupt Japan Airlines.Dealers settled on a value of Y33.875 for every Y100 worth of Aiful bonds in an auction that went smoothly, according to Markit which, together with Creditex, ran the sale. That means sellers of CDS, a form of insurance that pays out in the event of default, must pay the holders the shortfall of Y66.13.The success of the auction, which included loans as well as bonds, could help bolster domestic investors’ confidence in Japan’s CDS market, which is tiny compared with that of the US and Europe, analysts said.In the first part of the auction, market makers made bids and offers on Y200m of bonds and loans to create an initial market and benchmark price against which CDS holders could settle their positions. This left Y17bn worth of bonds to be disposed of, which were sold off in the second part of the auction, determining the final price of the bonds.Aiful last year asked creditors for financial assistance and halted payments on Y279.1bn ($3bn) of loans under an out-of-court alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure.Although the International Swaps and Derivatives Association initially did not recognise this move as a “credit event”, it later altered its stance.“This will set a precedent for the settlement of CDS and also more importantly set a precedent for companies going into the ADR process in Japan, where a credit event will automatically be triggered,” said Kristine Li, a credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.Many investors are now looking to JAL, which filed for bankruptcy protection this year. However, there are some differences with the airline’s case given that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and has more assets, whereas Aiful is undergoing an out-of-court restructuring, analysts said.
902;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-24T22:26:14Z;Downgrade intensifies eurozone woes;;The euro’s woes took centre stage on Wednesday as a ratings agency downgrade for Portugal and further uncertainty about a support package for Greece heightened concerns about sovereign debt, particularly in the eurozone.“There appears to be an accelerated and impending sense of doom about the status of the euro,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers. “The single currency is sitting on the edge of a precipice.”On the currency markets, the euro sank to a 10-month low against the dollar and touched a fresh record low against the Swiss franc after Fitch cut Portugal’s sovereign credit rating one notch to double A minus. Portuguese five-year credit default swaps widened 5 basis points to 139bp, according to Markit data, while the 10-year government bond yield rose 3bp to 4.34 per cent.Fitch’s move came amid intensifying fears about the potential implications of International Monetary Fund participation in any aid package for Greece.“Any IMF-backed deal for Greece may prevent further credit downgrades from the rating agencies but could also imply the fund would require a more austere economic plan considering that Athens cannot devalue its currency,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. “This may raise speculation of a temporary Greek exit from the eurozone to address the currency issue.”Relatively buoyant economic figures provided little support for the euro.German business sentiment this month improved to its best level since June 2008, according to the Ifo institute, while “flash’ estimates of the eurozone purchasing managers’ indices for March came in stronger than expected. Nick Kounis, economist at Fortis Bank, said the surveys suggested the eurozone economy had picked up steam at the end of the first quarter, but warned that weak domestic demand should limit the pace of recovery. “Although we think that global growth will remain buoyant, which should continue to underpin exports, domestic demand is likely to be lacklustre,” he said.Meanwhile, Norway’s central bank left interest rates unchanged due to fears that the country’s economic recovery might be fading.In the UK markets reacted relatively calmly to the Budget, which was viewed by many as little more than “political theatre” in the run-up to the general election.“The weakness in sterling and gilts today owes more to the concerns over the euro and resulting rally in the US dollar and rise in Treasury yields than the budget presentation itself,” said Stuart Thomson, chief economist at Ignis Asset Management.The pound touched a two-week low below $1.49, while the 10-year UK government bond yield rose 6bp to 3.98 per cent.In the US the 10-year Treasury yield shot up 15bp to 3.83 per cent as prices extended early losses after a weak auction of $42bn of five-year paper. The 10-year US swap spread was negative for a second day.Analysts said the debt problems of Greece and Portugal had underlined growing anxiety about the huge levels of borrowing elsewhere.Little real guidance for the Treasury market came from Wednesday’s US economic reports. New home sales fell to a record low last month, while headline durable goods orders increased for a third successive month but showed weakness in the equipment spending and shipments components.“Overall, these figures support our view that the peak in gross domestic product growth is behind us and that the recovery in the housing market is faltering,” said Paul Dales at Capital Economics.US equities faltered but overall showed resilience in the face of the turbulence elsewhere. At close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, as the Vix volatility index – a closely watched measure of risk aversion – jumped 7 per cent.Elsewhere, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent.Commodities were undermined by the firmer dollar. Oil fell to about $81 a barrel, further hurt by weekly US data showing a larger than expected rise in crude inventories, while gold slid 1.7 per cent to a six-week low below $1,086 an ounce.
903;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-24T17:30:50Z;Eurozone growth surges on back of euro slide;;The lower euro has given the eurozone economic recovery a new lease of life, with German manufacturing leading an unexpectedly strong growth spurt this month, according to data published on Wednesday.German manufacturing output expanded in March at the fastest pace since at least the mid-1990s and business confidence in Europe’s largest economy jumped to the highest in almost two years, according to several key surveys.The results revealed a silver lining in the crisis over Greek public finances, which has sent the euro sharply lower. Eurozone manufacturers have also benefited from the pick-up in activity. But the strength of Germany’s industrial sector could encourage calls for Berlin to do more to boost still-subdued domestic demand and help less-competitive neighbours.The Munich-based Ifo institute said its German business climate index had risen from 95.2 in February to 98.1 in March, the highest since June 2008. “Spring has also broken out in the economy,” said Hans-Werner Sinn, Ifo president.Separately, eurozone purchasing managers’ indices added to the evidence that the recovery was proving stronger than expected. Germany’s manufacturing output expanded at the fastest pace since 1996, with export orders also expanding at a record speed.Across the eurozone, “the combination of rising demand in key export markets and a competitive exchange rate has helped to boost manufacturing growth to a pace seen only once before in the past 10 years”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the PMI surveys.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at Unicredit, said the effect of the European single currency’s decline since last year was already being felt. “But it builds up over time – there is more in the pipeline,” he said.The “composite” purchasing managers’ index, covering services as well as manufacturing, rose from 53.7 in February to 55.5. That indicated private sector activity had increased for an eighth consecutive month.The latest index readings suggested eurozone gross domestic product rose by about 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year – up from just 0.1 per cent in the final three months of 2009, according to Markit. Official GDP figures will not be released until May.A weak spot remained the service sector, especially in France, which almost certainly reflected sluggish domestic demand.
904;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-24T14:27:15Z;Overview: Investors watch for signs of concern at IMF’s Greek role;All eyes on European Union summit starting on Thursday;"Greece’s fiscal woes dominated financial markets on Tuesday as investors watched for signs as to whether a financial aid package for the embattled nation might be forthcoming at a European Union summit starting on Thursday.Reports suggested that Germany had for the first time agreed to back an aid mechanism for Greece but only under tough conditions – including International Monetary Fund contributions to any rescue.Ulrich Leuchtmann, strategist at Commerzbank, warned that the currency markets were likely to remain extremely wary about IMF aid as opposed to a purely European solution.“Markets assume the likelihood of a Greek default under the IMF programme to be higher than in case of aid from the euro group,” Mr Leuchtmann said.“Investors expect the IMF to be stricter with Greece than its European neighbours would be. The IMF suspends payments as soon as a country deviates too far from the projected consolidation programmes.”Indeed, the euro eased back to stand within striking distance of a 10-month low against the dollar and touched its lowest level on record against the Swiss franc.But the spread between Greek and German 10-year government bond yields – the premium demanded by investors to hold Greek debt – narrowed 17 basis points to 325bp.The cost of insuring against a Greek debt default, as measured by five-year credit default swaps, fell 12bp to 328bp, according to Markit data.The UK – also a recent focus for investors’ sovereign debt concerns – was in the news as data showed that the country’s annual rate of consumer price inflation had slowed to
3 per cent in February from a 14-month high of 3.5 per cent. Analysts had expected a drop to 3.1 per cent.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said he suspected that UK interest rates would stay at 0.5 per cent through 2010 given ongoing concerns within the Bank of England over the strength and sustainability of the recovery.He said: “Furthermore, when interest rates finally do start to rise, the increases are likely to be gradual and limited due to the need to offset the marked tightening in fiscal policy that will start in 2011 at the latest.”The figures kept sterling below $1.50 for much of the day, although it rallied back above that level as the session wore on.US equities, meanwhile, offered a relatively muted response to further signs of fragility in housing.Existing home sales fell 0.6 per cent last month to an annual rate of 5.02m units, the lowest level in eight months and a third decline in a row – although the drop was smaller than many had feared.However, analysts noted a troubling jump in inventories to 8.6 months’ worth of supply from 7.8 in January, which they said was probably a result of distressed properties coming on to the market.Teunis Brosens, economist at ING, noted that existing home sales were 20 per cent below their November peak.“The excess amount of 1.5m foreclosed homes that mortgage lenders are sitting on casts a shadow over the market,” he said. “A strong housing market recovery therefore seems unlikely.”But by close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent, to an 18-month high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 0.7 per cent.There was a more subdued tone in Japan where the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.5 per cent.Mislav Matejka, strategist at JP Morgan Cazenove, said most investors he had spoken to took the view that equity markets were stuck in a range without a near-term catalyst for a break-out.But he said that, in spite of numerous headwinds, he remained positive on stocks in the near term.“We do not see a significant move up in bond yields, no Federal Reserve action for the foreseeable future and we think growth will continue recovering,” Mr Matejka said.In commodities, oil prices inched up 31 cents to $81.91 a barrel in choppy trading, although base metals eased back. Gold edged up to $1,104 an ounce after spending much of the day
below $1,100."
905;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-21T19:55:33Z;European groups’ dividends set to rise 18%;;Dividends at European groups are set to jump this year as profitability recovers from the credit crisis.Pay-outs to shareholders are expected to rise 18 per cent for large European companies, according to a consensus forecast compiled by Factset, a data provider.The forecast reflects optimism about dividend payments after a large number of companies declared higher dividends than expected for the past year.Of the 354 members of the Stoxx Euro 600 index to report dividends so far, 51 per cent have beaten analysts’ expectations and only 21 per cent have missed them, according to ING.Among the companies that surprised the most were Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker, and Swiss Re, the reinsurance group.Factset estimates that, based on the current forecasts for 2010 pay-outs, shares in the Stoxx Euro 600 index were trading on a prospective dividend yield of 3.5 per cent.Chris Grigg, chief executive of British Land, the UK’s second-largest property group, said the increased pay-outs by European groups were a sign of confidence.“The sensible companies have done it because it is a signal that profits will recover.”But some analysts suggest it might reflect a lack of clarity on what to do with excess cash.Gareth Williams, ING European equity strategist, said shareholders were asking: “Is it a sign companies don’t know what to do with the money? Or that there is an absence of growth opportunities?”ING data show that the rolling average for the past six months of whether dividends have increased or decreased has moved positive for the first time in more than a year.For the past year as a whole, however, the biggest 50 European companies cut their dividends on average by 9 per cent, according to Markit, a data provider. It forecasts that 33 groups will raise pay-outs this year and none will cut them.Even those companies that have surprised negatively such as Daimler, the German carmaker which cancelled its dividend completely, are pledging to make increases a priority.Bodo Uebber, Daimler chief financial officer, said: “We didn’t do it with pleasure but because it was necessary. [Restoring it] is a priority.”The resilience of dividends last year as earnings collapsed means that half of the 50 largest groups’ pay-out ratios – dividends as a proportion of profits – are above historic levels. Factset estimated that the ratio for 2009 was 53 per cent but this is expected to fall to 44 per cent in 2010.The high pay-out ratio has led to concern in some countries that companies have been rewarding shareholders while cutting jobs. Some companies such as Fiat, the Italian carmaker, have even paid a dividend while reporting a net loss for the year.
906;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
907;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-08T22:41:30Z;Mood improves as eurozone debt fears recede;;"Investors showed signs of fatigue on Monday after last week’s improvement in confidence, although the underlying mood remained positive given a further easing of concerns about Greece and fresh optimism about the US economy.Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president, offered a strong signal over the weekend that eurozone countries would help Greece were its financial problems to worsen.“With political support for Greece increasing, markets are putting sovereign risk behind them,” said Camilla Sutton, strategist at Scotia Capital.This was reflected in further falls in the cost of insuring against debt default for most peripheral eurozone nations. Greece’s five-year credit default swap fell 16 basis points to 284bp – well down from recent highs above 400bp – while Portugal’s fell 7bp to 114bp, according to Markit data.The gap between the yields on 10-year Greek government bonds over German Bunds narrowed 7bp to 283bp – although it widened at one stage as Jürgen Stark, a member of the European Central Bank’s executive board, reportedly opposed the creation of a European Monetary Fund.Meanwhile, Friday’s encouraging US employment report offered a further plank of support for the recent better tone in the markets.Jan Loeys, global head of market strategy at JPMorgan, said confidence in the sustainability of the rally was growing as the biggest threats – from a weak global jobs environment and premature policy tightening – were easing.He said numerous countries were already reporting job gains and that the last few weeks had provided a number of signals that central banks recognised economic vulnerabilities and falling inflation and would thus stay on hold.“Risks are receding from high to not so high anymore, and are low compared to what is priced into asset markets,” he said. “We have moved from small to normal ‘overweights’ of risky assets.”But others were less optimistic about the longer-term outlook. “The foundation beneath investors’ improved sentiment about the health of the global economy is extremely thin,” warned Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon.“While excessive monetary liquidity, depressed volatilities and improving US labour figures make it unprofitable to bet against asset price appreciation in the short run, systemic risks surrounding the more vulnerable European states can easily resurface.”But for Monday, at least, the improved confidence over Greece kept the euro above the $1.36 level and helped it gain ground against the yen.Elsewhere in the currency markets, sterling reversed an early advance against the dollar as investors remained uncertain about the UK’s political and fiscal outlook.Asian equities enjoyed strong gains as investors got their first chance to respond to Friday’s US jobs figures. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose
2.1 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 2 per cent, with both indices closing at six-week highs.But the momentum faded, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 ending 0.1 per cent lower and the S&P 500 ending flat in New York on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the’s index’s bottom. The Vix volatility index bounced 1.2 per cent to 17.63 after ending last week at its lowest since May 2008.Corporate credit indices improved on both sides of the Atlantic, with the investment-grade Markit CDX North America index down 3.4bp at a seven-week low of 85bp. The iTraxx Europe fell 2.87bp to 78.01bp.The improving outlook for the US economy pushed government bond prices lower as the market braced for $74bn of issuance this week. The yield on the 10-year note rose 3bp to 3.71 per cent.The 10-year UK gilt yield rose 2bp to 4.09 per cent ahead of Tuesday’s £3bn ($4.5bn) auction of long-dated bonds. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 2bp to 3.16 per cent.In commodities, crude oil could not sustain an early advance to an eight-week high above $82 a barrel. In late trade, April WTI was up 37 cents at $81.87.Gold fell 1 per cent to $1,122."
908;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-02T22:42:25Z;Overview: Stocks rise on hopes of Greek rescue;Stocks in the US and UK in positive territory for the year;Further signs that Greece might be nearing a resolution with the European Union over a debt rescue deal offered a positive backdrop to risk assets on Tuesday, with stocks in the US and UK in positive territory for the year.The Vix volatility index – closely watched as a guide to risk aversion – fell 0.7 per cent to 19.12, not far away from a 20-month low struck in January.However, both sterling and the euro remained under some pressure following the weakness seen in both currencies on Monday.“The decoupling between foreign exchange rates and the broader sentiment in risk markets highlights the structural long-term concerns surrounding sovereign risk, notwithstanding optimism about growth or policy rates,” said Lena Komileva, G7 market economist at Tullett Prebon.On the currency markets, sterling failed to re-test Monday’s 10-month low of $1.4784 but still ended the day another 0.2 per cent weaker. But the UK’s five-year credit default swap narrowed 5 basis points to 82bp, while UK government bonds rallied. The yield on the 10-year Gilt fell 6bp to 4.02 per cent, with the spread over German Bunds narrowing to 90bp from 98bp.Worries over peripheral eurozone nations also showed signs of receding as the cost of insuring against sovereign debt default fell sharply. Indeed, the iTraxx SovX index of western European sovereign CDS prices fell below the investment-grade iTraxx Europe index for the first time since mid-January. Greece’s five-year credit default swap narrowed 32bp to 308bp, according to Markit data, while Portugal’s tightened 25bp. The Greek 10-year government bond yield fell a further 10bp to 6.16 per cent, off an earlier low of 6.08 per cent.But in spite of the apparently easing fears of contagion within the eurozone, the euro touched a fresh nine-month trough against the US currency, before paring its decline. Jessica Hoversen, foreign exchange analyst at MF Global, said that beyond the issue of sovereign risk, the economic backdrop as well as the outlook for interest rates was driving the euro’s weakness.“It is unlikely that the European Central Bank will be able to hike interest rates before the Federal Reserve, giving the dollar the interest rate differential and keeping monetary policy loose in the eurozone for some time,” she said.“Fiscal policy, on the other hand, is likely to tighten not because of economic improvements but due to austerity and the need to reduce public deficits.”Central bank exit strategies were in focus elsewhere as the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia held policy meetings.The BoC left interest rates unchanged at 0.25 per cent and reiterated a pledge to keep them on hold until June – but said inflation and growth had been stronger than expected, prompting some analysts to suggest rates could be on the way up later this year. The Canadian dollar hit a five-week high against its US counterpart.The Australian dollar inched up 0.2 per cent after the RBA raised rates by 25 basis points to 4 per cent – its fourth increase in five meetings – and signalled further tightening in coming months.Global equities enjoyed a positive day. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent. The FTSE 100 in London jumped 1.5 per cent, giving it a gain over the course of 2010.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.8 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.5 per cent. Emerging market stocks rose for a third day.Despite the push into positive territory for the year, John Higgins at Capital Economics warned US stocks faced a tough time and suggested the S&P 500 could end 2010 lower than it is now. He said valuations were no longer compellingly attractive, the economic recovery was likely to run out of steam, and that stocks could be hit by a scaling back of unconventional policy support.In commodities, oil made a fresh foray above $80 but fell back to end the day at $79.68, a gain of 1.25 per cent. Copper extended its rise amid worries over supplies from Chile. Gold touched its highest level since January in dollar terms and reached fresh record highs in euros and sterling.
909;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-03-01T11:35:44Z;UK manufacturing stays on recovery road;;Britain’s manufacturing sector appears on a firm road to recovery, with a closely watched index reporting that activity in February held at a 15-year high.The CIPS/Markit purchasing managers’ index for the manufacturing sector registered 56.6, with employers reporting a particularly strong jump in export orders. The export orders sub-component registered 60.5, up from 57.5 in January.“We’re really seeing signs that seem to point towards a full sector recovery,” said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. “Most notably, companies reported that higher demand from export markets wasn’t just on the back of the softer sterling but also improving global market conditions.”Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ”Manufacturing growth is still being supported by the rebuilding of inventories, which is providing a short term boost.”He also noted that the rise in export orders was a record for a single month and said this indicated exporters were now taking advantage of the weaker pound to gain market share overseas.The manufacturing figures were in line with those in the eurozone, which also grew slightly faster than previously thought last month, although Spain and Greece continued to lag far behind.The employment reading in the UK remained above 50, a level that indicates demand is neutral, but CIPS noted that it was only marginally so.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “It appears that manufacturers are currently benefiting appreciably from leaner stock levels, improved competitiveness in both domestic and foreign markets stemming from the weak pound, and firmer demand in key overseas markets.“There are also signs that domestic demand is picking up.”However, Mr Archer noted that manufacturing accounted for less than one-fifth of UK GDP, and warned against interpreting the strong reading as a guide to the wider economy.CIPS also identified some worrying trends building up on the inflation front. Input prices recorded a sharp jump, with that sub-component reading at 65.3, suggesting rapid rises.Manufacturers reported that higher commodity, energy, metal and paper prices are all placing pressure on their own costs. Also, the reversion of value added tax to its pre-crisis rate of 17.5 per cent is likely to add to inflation.Output prices also rose but by a more modest amount. That component registered 54.3, up from 53.2, suggesting that manufacturers are trying to hold the line on the prices they charge for finished goods in order to remain competitive.
910;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-21T18:31:05Z;Harsh winter hits European recovery hopes;;Severe winter weather could have have hit economic growth significantly in continental Europe, and especially Germany, at the start of this year, dealing another blow to the region’s recovery hopes.Disruption in the construction, retail and leisure industries caused by exceptionally low temperatures and persistent snow is likely to have set back further an economic turnround that had already shown signs of losing momentum in the final months of last year – before the bitter weather took grip.In Germany, growth in the first quarter of this year could have been reduced 0.3 percentage points, according to Frankfurt-based Commerzbank. January’s weather was the coldest since 1987 and the 12th coldest January since 1900, according to the German weather service.Axel Weber, Bundesbank president, told Reuters this month that German gross domestic product “could move sideways or even contract slightly in the first quarter”.Jörg Krämer, Commerzbank’s chief economist, said, however, that lost business could be made up, and “people’s perceptions of the performance of the German economy are driven by the data on manufacturing – that is, excluding construction”.Purchasing managers’ indices on Friday showed that German manufacturing “grew strongly” in February, he added.With the recovery largely export-led, and domestic demand still dependent on emergency government stimulus packages, GDP in the eurozone rose just 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, and was flat in Germany.Eurozone first-quarter growth could have been slowed 0.1 of a percentage point by the weather, according to Commerzbank. In the region’s service company sector, purchasing managers’ indices have shown growth slowing markedly so far in 2010 – and not just in Germany.Calculations by Markit, the information group that produces the indices, suggest that much of the deceleration was snow-related, at least in January.Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “Without the adverse weather conditions affecting northern Europe it is likely that the accelerating growth trend in German services would have continued in January and the deceleration in France would have been less pronounced.” The “snow effect” in January was also particularly large in Ireland.Nevertheless, Germany and France remained the eurozone’s best performers in February, helping offset weaker performances elsewhere, including by Spain and Greece. “Even the heavy snow couldn’t derail the two-track nature of the current recovery,” Mr Dobson said.FIEC, the European construction industry association, reported widespread evidence that the sector had been affected much more than normal this winter. “We expect that the seasonal downturn will be deepened,” it said. In Belgium, for instance, where worksites are not usually closed for more than 15-20 days, 30 “bad weather days” had been reported.Official figures for the building sector suggest that the effects were already being felt in December. After adjustment for normal seasonal variations, Germany and France reported falls in construction output of 2.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent in the month compared with November. But, overall, eurozone construction activity rose 0.5 per cent – boosted by a 6.2 per cent rise in Spain.
911;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-15T23:00:42Z;Euro at nine-month low ahead of EU meeting;Investors awaited further developments in Greece;"The euro remained under pressure on Monday as investors awaited further developments on European support measures for Greece, although market activity was light due to holidays in the US and much of Asia and Latin America.The single currency spent much of the day stuck below $1.36 and within striking distance of a nine-month low of $1.3529 hit on Friday.Eurozone finance ministers began a two-day meeting on Monday, although there were few hopes that specific measures to bail out Greece would be forthcoming – particularly after last week’s declaration of support for the country from the EU resulted in many investors feeling short-changed.“The lack of detail on the EU plan reflects in part the belief that a Greek default is not an immediate concern, and in part the desire to limit growth of implicit public liabilities across the region, given that every single government faces a tougher funding environment this year and the policy safety net is virtually exhausted,” said Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon.Away from Greece, several other issues with the potential to unsettle sentiment continued to bubble away beneath the surface.The cost of insuring Dubai’s sovereign debt against default reached the highest level for 11 months amid growing concerns about the debt restructuring of state-owned Dubai World. Dubai’s five-year credit default swaps reached 660 basis points, up from 633bp at the close on Friday, according to data from Markit.Dubai World has not yet reached agreement with its banks over $22bn of debts. A weekend report – denied by Dubai – suggested that a plan to repay lenders 60 per cent over seven years was being considered.China’s decision on Friday to raise the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks also remained a talking point for strategists.Fiona Lake, of Goldman Sachs, said: “With strong growth and rising inflationary pressures, it is no surprise that the Chinese authorities are taking steps to remove some of the current monetary accommodation and we expect further tightening moves, including further RRR hikes, interest rate hikes, further window guidance on lending and renminbi appreciation.”Concerns about the potential impact of the move on Chinese growth dented those Asia-Pacific equity markets that were open. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.8 per cent while Australian stocks shed 0.4 per cent.The RRR increase overshadowed a surprisingly robust set of Japanese growth data. Gross domestic product in the three months to the end of December grew by 1.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter, more than most commentators had expected, helped by a stimulus-fuelled rebound in domestic demand.Julian Jessop, of Capital Economics, said he expected both business investment and housebuilding to make significant contributions to GDP growth in the first half of this year“Overall, the strength of Japan’s recovery may well surprise the markets for a few quarters more as pent-up investment spending kicks in,” Mr Jessop said. “In turn, this should allow the Nikkei to outperform other major markets – or at least do less badly – as well as ease some of the markets’ concerns about
the risks of a sovereign default.”European stocks managed to make modest gains, although the lack of input from the US made for a session lacking in real direction. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.4 per cent as financials attracted demand.European government bonds also had a relatively quiet day. The 10-year Bund yield edged up 1bp to 3.2 per cent while the Greek 10-year yield rose 8bp to 6.25 per cent.In commodities, gold climbed back to $1,100 a troy ounce and, in euro terms, rose to €808.14, within sight of December’s record €812.43, as the outlook for the single currency remained uncertain.Copper led a broad rally in base metals as demand hopes were buoyed by the Japanese data but the benchmark US oil price ended unchanged at $74.13 a barrel.ICE April Brent lost 39 cents to $72.51 a barrel."
912;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-15T19:35:45Z;Fundraisings pulled as investors think again;;A Canadian aircraft and train maker, one of Europe’s largest coal producers, a Norwegian oil rig company and a UK fashion retailer have something in common. Each has had to shelve a fundraising in recent weeks as market conditions have deteriorated and investors have begun to demand better terms.In recent days, a series of bond issues and IPOs by companies in Europe and the US have been pulled as a result of choppy market conditions. UK retailer New Look pulled a planned IPO. Bombardier, New World Resources and Songa Offshore are among those that have pulled bond offerings.There are others. Eirik Winter, head of European debt capital markets at Citigroup, says several companies that had intended to sell bonds but whose plans had not become public have also abandoned those plans.As government stimulus programmes are unwound and as uncertainty about some countries’ ability to finance their debts has intensified in recent weeks, costs of fundraising for companies have also risen.“Liquidity is being gradually pulled back in China and is likely to be followed by the US and Europe. Concerns [about] sovereign credit [are] pushing up funding costs for sovereigns, banks and corporates with some investors questioning whether we are headed into a soft patch over the summer or even a double-dip scenario,” says Vivek Tawadey, head of credit portfolio strategy and credit research at BNP Paribas. “Any doubts [about] growth will quickly reflect on lower corporate earnings growth that will weigh on sentiment.”The Markit iTraxx main index, a barometer of market sentiment in regard to corporate credit, rose to 92 basis points on Monday, having been as low as 65bp in early January. For investors, that means the cost of protecting themselves from default for these index constituents has risen €27,000 ($36,700) a year for each €10m of bonds.Mr Winter says investor confidence is being dented. “We are seeing a correction in markets because the rally of recent months had been driven by hope of a recovery rather than [by] fundamentals,” he says.“There is a cloud on the horizon with all the sovereign debt refinancing. Theoretically, the different asset classes should be separate but we have seen that when crisis hits one class, it affects all parts of bond markets. This has lowered investors’ confidence and this is why deals are being pulled.”Another disquieting factor for companies seeking funding is a reversal in the flow of money that had been pouring into bond funds last year, which had helped revive credit markets and even led some rating agencies to lower their default rate expectations.Investors have been selling out of junk bonds at the fastest rate since September 2005. In the week that ended on Wednesday, almost $1bn (£640m) was withdrawn from US funds that hold high-yield corporate bonds, according to Lipper FMI, the largest outflow in almost four and a half years.In the UK, corporate bond fund net sales waned further to £64m in December, according to Investment Management Association data. Retail bond funds saw inflows in January – but only after two months of outflows. Analysts at BNP Paribas say that excluding October and June, the latest inflows into corporate bond funds were the lowest since October 2008.“The news of pulled deals, including IPOs and new bond issues, means we need to reassess corporate risk,” says Theo Phanos, founder of Trafalgar Asset Managers, a European credit fund. “2010 is shaping up to be a tougher year all round.”Rating agency Moody’s reckons companies need to consider the possibility of restricted access to all funding markets simultaneously. “The current turmoil in the capital markets will continue to make it harder for the more leveraged companies to refinance without some debt writedown,” Chetan Modi, senior credit officer at Moody’s says in a report published on Tuesday.“Reduced access to capital markets would be one of the factors that could lead to a higher default rate.”Some borrowers are still being successful, however. Last week, GMAC, the auto and home lender, raised $2bn with its first bond sale not backed by the government since the financial crisis. On Monday, UK retailer Supergroup announced plans to raise up to £125m in the equity markets, valuing the Cheltenham-based fashion retailer at about £400m.“We think investors still have money to put to work and issuance volumes are up markedly year on year,” says Nick Williams, head of equity capital markets for Europe Middle East and Africa at Credit Suisse. He adds that several recent placings have worked well and the aftermarket performance of some IPOs has also been positive.“The current market uncertainty is proving to be a headache for some of the street’s IPO calendar. Some sponsors may decide not to proceed with sales of trophy assets if they feel market conditions are too fragile or investors are not sufficiently constructive.”Moody’s says certain leveraged companies with solid credit profiles are abandoning plans to issue bonds as banks are improving loan terms.But some believe difficult market conditions could be protracted. Pressure on governments is expected to remain an issue.“The IPOs and bonds getting pulled are a symptom of the market’s malaise, not a cause,” says Matt King, credit strategist at Citigroup. “There is, admittedly, a feedback loop – in which companies that can’t raise money go bankrupt – but it’s way too early to be talking in those terms.“So far we’ve just argued that the balance of risks has changed, but that our base case [of economic recovery and tighter credit spreads] still stands.“Yet the tail risks have increased massively from only …a few weeks ago.”
913;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-04T22:01:04Z;Sovereign debt fears rattle investors;Euro and equities tumble and yields widen as contagion spreads;2150 GMT: Fears of sovereign debt contagion across the eurozone sent European markets sharply lower on Thursday as negative sentiment spread to Wall Street with US markets also hit by worse than expected jobless data.US stocks suffered their biggest daily sell-off since April last year, taking the major indices down to November 2009 levels.European and UK stock markets fell more than 2 per cent, with Portuguese and Spanish stock markets leading the declines with falls of 5 per cent or more. Investors also sold sovereign debt in these periphery eurozone countries and sought the safety of the dollar and US Treasuries.Reflecting those concerns, the western Europe Markit SovX index, which measures the cost of insuring against the risk of default, widened beyond 100 basis points for the first time amid heavy buying in the sovereign credit default swap market. CDS spreads on Portugal hit record highs, up 28 basis points to 222 basis points, while Greek credit default swaps rose 21 basis points to 412 basis points, heading closer to records of 421 basis points reached in January.“The latest catalyst was [Wednesday’s] bond auction in Portugal, which was scaled back and which has reignited fears that the likes of Portugal and Greece will not be able to fund their deficits without a bail-out,” said Gavan Nolan, credit analyst at Markit.Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, sought to play down concerns over Greece, saying he was “confident that the Greek government will take all the decisions that will permit [it] to reach” the medium-term goal of cutting its budget deficit. The ECB left its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent at its meeting.Mr Trichet’s comments helped Greek government debt, with 10-year bonds rallying, pushing yields 10 basis points lower at 6.6 per cent.But contagion concerns started to spread to corporates, with CDS spreads on companies such as Portugal Telecom, Telefónica and Hellenic Telecom rising significantly in strong trading volumes. CDS spreads on Portugal Telecom jumped 30 basis points to 150 basis points, their highest levels since April last year.Portugal’s 10-year bonds jumped 6 basis points to yield 4.71 per cent. Ten-year Spanish sovereign yields were up 3 basis points at 4.13 per cent.The euro fell below $1.373 against the dollar, hitting lows last seen in May 2009.“The euro was initially buoyed yesterday [Wednesday] by the European Commission’s endorsement of the Greek debt plan,” said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. “However, it slipped back after Portugal cut a planned treasury bill issue and Spain disclosed that its budget deficits for the next three years will be higher than forecast. It would appear the sovereign debt problem is turning into a contagion in the eurozone.”The dollar benefited from its safe haven status and was up 0.7 per cent against a basket of trade-weighted currencies, its highest level since July last year. US Treasuries also rallied on a flight to safety, sending yields lower with 10-year US Treasury yields down 10 basis points to 3.6 per cent amid similar falls across the yield curve.Worse than expected jobless data in the US added to the woes, sending US shares sharply lower. In data out on Thursday ahead of Friday’s keenly awaited non-farm payroll numbers, first-time claims for US unemployment benefits showed a rise of 8,000 last week to 480,000, against analysts’ expectations of a fall.US markets followed European and Asian markets lower with the S&P 500 down 3.1 per cent. The declines followed sharp falls in Europe with the FTSE 100 down 2.4 per cent and the Eurofirst 300 down 2.8 per cent. Portuguese and Spanish markets were worst hit with Spain’s Ibex 5.8 per cent lower and Portugal’s PSI 20 down 4.9 per cent.Commodities were also sharply lower with US crude falling $3.77 to $73.21 a barrel and gold 4.2 per cent lower at $1,063 an ounce.In Asia, continued concerns over monetary tightening in China sent Asian equity markets lower, with the Shanghai Composite closing down 0.3 per cent and the Nikkei 225 half a per cent lower following Wednesday’s brief rally in Asia.Banks in China led the retreat after China’s sovereign wealth fund denied reports that it was looking to buy shares in the country’s top banks.A surprise fall in Australian retail sales – down 0.7 per cent in December from the previous month – hurt Australian equity markets, with the S&P/ASX 200 down 0.6 per cent.The news also damaged the Australian dollar, still reeling from the surprise decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia earlier in the week to hold off from raising interest rates. The Aussie, long a popular carry-trade currency, hit a six-week low of $0.8660 against the US currency.The New Zealand jobless rate also rose to its highest level in more than a decade, hitting 7.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, sending the kiwi to a five-month low against the greenback of $0.6881.
914;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Greek debt woes spread to Portugal and Spain;;Portugal and Spain became focuses of concern on Thursday as contagion from Greece’s sovereign difficulties intensified.Credit default swaps were pushed to record highs, while yield spreads between 10-year German Bunds and the bonds of other indebted economies widened further.Greece’s 10-year bond initially steadied on Wednesday after the European Commission endorsed the country’s plans to reduce its debt. As Portugal and Spain both came under fire on Thursday however, the yield on the Greek note rose 6.1 basis points to 6.74 per cent as the price fell.The spread between Greece and the German 10-year Bund widened to 360bp, shy of its record wide of 421bp, while five-year credit default swaps widened 20bp to 410bp, meaning the cost of insuring €10m of Greek sovereign debt rose to €410,000 ($567,825) – off last week’s closing high of €422,500.“The singular concentration on Greece seems to be evolving into a ‘Club Med’ kaleidoscope,” said Sean Maloney at Nomura.“Market focus had moved initially to Portugal, but is also lining up the next domino: Spain. Small irregularities in fiscal or funding spheres are being picked up by the market and magnified in spread moves.”In Portugal, the yield on the 10-year note rose 12.1bp to 4.81 per cent and the spread over the 10-year Bund widened to as high as 175bp, before easing back to 158bp.On the CDS market, the cost of insuring Portuguese debt against the risk of default rose to a record high of €216,000 per €10m held according to data from Markit.Spain’s 10-year yield pushed as much as 5.8bp higher to 4.19 per cent, before settling back at 4.14 per cent. Spain’s CDS widened by 13bp to 147bp.The moves on debt markets, coming on the same day as the European Central Bank’s latest monetary policy meeting, undermined Europe’s equity markets, and ensured a weaker euro on currency markets.“There are still lot of uncertainties regarding the Greeks and other indebted European sovereigns over the deficit issue,” said Guillaume Tresca at Calyon.“One day, the issue seems to be contained and the next day the market goes into tail spin. With so many uncertainties, it makes it tough to expect anything else other than a choppy emerging market.”
915;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Record volumes for sovereign CDS;;European sovereign credit default swaps used to protect bond holders against default saw record volumes last week because of the volatility surrounding Greece and worries over its public finances.Figures published on Wednesday for the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe index, which tracks 15 western European nations, saw volumes jump to $71bn in gross notional outstanding trades.This is a 17 per cent jump over the week and its highest level since the index was launched in September.CDS volumes of all the so-called peripheral economies in the eurozone saw record, or close-to-record, volumes last week as banks and hedge funds bought and sold protection to profit from the volatility, according to figures from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.Mehernosh Engineer, senior credit strategist at BNP Paribas, said: “The sovereign CDS markets are now more liquid than some of the European bond markets. They are used widely as an indicator of sentiment.”Greece, which saw its CDS price hit a record 400 basis points last week – or $400,000 to protect $10m of debt against default annually over five years – saw its individual volumes rise to $76bn.Italy, which has one of the deepest bond markets in Europe, saw the biggest volumes of all countries last week. They rose to $222bn.Significantly, volumes in sovereign CDS are now higher than many big European companies, such as British Telecom, France Telecom and Vodafone.Companies in the telecoms sector have, in the past, tended to see the highest volumes.Last week, however, all three companies only saw volumes of $47bn, $65bn and $41bn, respectively.Volumes among Europe’s peripheral sovereign economies are nearly double what they were this time last year as record levels of bond issuance and worries over rising debt has made the markets more volatile, creating trading opportunities for hedge funds and banks.However, volumes on the SovX index, which includes Germany, France and the UK as well as the peripheral eurozone economies, are still nowhere near those of Markit’s iTraxx Europe index, which tracks the prices of Europe’s biggest companies.Last week, iTraxx Europe saw volumes of $500bn.The uncertainty surrounding the public finances of European governments saw the SovX index rise above the iTraxx Europe index for the first time last month.
916;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Services sector growth lower in January;;Heavy snow dashed hopes of a stronger recovery in the UK economy in the first month of the year as it helped depress growth in services sector activity, according to closely watched survey published on Wednesday.The purchasing managers index for services industries fell in January to 54.5 from 56.8 the previous month, where any figure below 50 points to a fall in activity, and a number above 50 signals companies are reporting increasing business. The index excludes retail and distribution, as well as government services.The figures only point to a small slowing of the growth rate – with the survey suggesting a ninth consecutive month of expansion in the sector – but leave the index at its lowest level since August.Markit, which produces the report, said “UK service sector growth stalled at the start of 2010 as snow-related disruptions undermined activity and new business”.Analysts at Capital Economics commented: “The economy is clearly struggling to maintain even the meagre expansion it saw at the end of last year.”The slowdown in January underlines the threat that the first quarter could still see the UK return to recession, after the fourth quarter of last year saw much slower-than-expected economic growth of just 0.1 per cent.The combination of a rise in value added tax with the cold weather in January poses a risk to already subdued consumer spending.The figures do come after the purchasing managers index for manufacturing published earlier this week showed activity in the sector rising at its fastest pace in 15 years, as the weak pound boosted export orders.“Despite this setback for the CIPS services, we are confident that this will be temporary,” said Alan Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas. “The fundamentals that have underpinned the impressive rebound in the CIPS surveys remain in place, ie: equities have bounced back, monetary policy remains very loose and the GBP exchange rate has weakened over the last year or so.But although the purchasing managers indices continue to suggest that the economy is growing, they have not correlated well with official gross domestic product estimates in recent quarters, suggesting higher growth and an earlier end to recession than proved to be the case.Chancellor Alistair Darling has warned there will be “bumps in the road” as the UK leaves recession, highlighting the risk of a fickle recovery.The survey showed that the increase in VAT at the start of the year pushed up input costs at the fastest rate since October 2008 and also led to slightly higher output charges.Responses to the survey showed the poor weather in the month damped a rise in new business. Hotels and restaurants were particularly hard hit and unemployment continued to rise.
917;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-02T02:40:31Z;Global manufacturing surges back;;"Manufacturing activity soared around the world in January, according to surveys released on Monday that will bolster the hopes of a strong global recovery.In the US, the Institute for Supply Management index– a key measure of industrial activity – rose from 54.9 to 58.4, its highest level since August 2004 and well ahead of economists’ expectations.The key components of the index – production, employment and new orders – all increased, leading Norbert Ore, chair of the ISM survey, to declare that the report offered “significant assurance that the manufacturing sector is in recovery”.The comforting US data followed strong evidence from Asia and Europe that manufacturers are beginning to ramp up production to meet stronger demand.China reported record industrial activity for the month while the purchasing managers’ indices in India , South Korea and Taiwan also rose strongly.India’s HSBC PMI rose from 55.6 in December to 57.7 in January, the strongest level since August 2008.The eurozone’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.4 last month, against 51.6 at the end of 2009.It was the fourth month in succession that the 3,000-strong panel surveyed by Markit reported overall growth in the manufacturing sector.Industrial growth was led by the region’s healthiest economies, especially France, where manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in almost a decade.Germany and Italy were also strong, as was the UK , where weaker sterling helped manufacturing activity increase to a 15-year high last month.The latest ISM data in the US underscores the good news on the health of the economy.On Friday, the government said output rose unexpectedly quickly in the fourth quarter – at an annualised rate of 5.7 per cent – on the back of higher business spending and much slower inventory reductions.Factories ease fears

918;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;French output rate accelerates sharply;;Manufacturing in France showed further signs of recovery on Monday after a closely watched survey indicated output was accelerating at its fastest rate since 2000.The eurozone purchasing managers’ index showed output of French manufacturing hitting 61.1, the highest level for 9½ years, according to revised figures for January.The survey provides further evidence of a sustained if timid upturn in manufacturing, which took hold in France at the tail end of 2009. It showed increases in new orders, output and backlogs of orders, the latter growing by the fastest rate since November 2006.The government two weeks ago doubled its economic growth forecast for 2010 to 1.4 per cent, citing an acceleration of the recovery at the end of 2009.However, economists warned that signs of improvement in manufacturing did not necessarily presage a return to robust and balanced growth of the economy.“This is just a technical recovery,” said Alexander Law, chief economist at Paris-based consultants Xerfi. “It does not mean that we are returning to normal growth.”The PMI, published by Markit, provides a measure of acceleration or deceleration in output rather than the overall level. Manufacturing output is expected to remain at pre-crisis levels for some time to come.According to Insee, the French statistics agency, manufacturing industry turnover in November was down 10.2 per cent on the same period a year earlier.Mr Law said that recent data showed little sign of a bounce back in business investment or foreign trade. Household consumption, which has continued to expand, albeit modestly, through most of the economic crisis is also likely to remain insipid as consumers react to further increases in unemployment.Analysts forecast that the 18,700 fall in the number of unemployed in December is unlikely to be sustained in the coming months.
919;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-01T12:35:30Z;Output in EU countries accelerates to 2-year high;;The eurozone’s manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate for two years in January, but the chasm between the bloc’s healthiest and weakest economies is widening, according to a closely watched survey.The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.4 in January, against 51.6 at the end of 2009 and above an earlier “flash” estimate of 52.0.It is the fourth month in a row that the 3,000-strong panel surveyed by Markit has reported overall growth in the manufacturing sector, and most measures of the sector’s health are growing at the fastest rate in years as the eurozone economy recovers.The sector's growth was driven by the 16-country bloc’s healthiest economies, especially France, now expanding at its fastest pace in close to a decade. Germany and Italy also contributed to the growth.By contrast, the survey reflects the fears about weaker eurozone manufacturers losing their competitiveness . Greece, Spain and Ireland all recorded lower output and faster contraction.Across the manufacturing landscape – production, new orders, employment, inventories and supplier performance – the so-called “peripheral” members of the eurozone are falling further and further behind the “core” users of the single currency.Colin Ellis at Daiwa Capital Markets remarked that the data “signal the difficult economic challenges facing Spain and Greece, compared with the larger euro area economies. The current fiscal problems that the markets have focused on are partly the symptom of a wider economic malaise, namely the erosion of competitiveness over several years due to strong wage growth, compared with productivity gains.”Manufacturing PMI surveys are used by many analysts as a rough gauge of a country’s overall economic prospects, in spite of inconclusive correlation during the downturn. But the data from Monday’s survey chime with official indicators such as the European Commission’s business and consumer indicators, which are also highlighting a growing gap between the healthiest and weakest economies.Indirectly, the fiscal troubles afflicting some of the “peripheral” countries have helped the manufacturing sector by depressing the value of the single currency. The euro has fallen from a 15-month high of $1.51 in late November to $1.39 now, making goods priced in euros more competitive internationally.Across the eurozone, however, the survey pointed to some weaknesses that could have an impact on the sector’s long-term prospects even in the core economies. Job losses continued to rise – for the twentieth consecutive month – including in Germany, which has so far been largely sheltered from rising unemployment.Average selling prices at the factory gate fell for the 15th month running, in spite of a 16-month increase in purchasing prices, suggesting ever-shrinking profit margins.Rob Dodson, economist at Markit, concluded that the manufacturing sector is retaining a “cautious” outlook, while sales are being supported by price discounting.
920;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-02-01T10:49:06Z;Manufacturing shows fastest growth for 15 years;;Activity in the UK manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace for 15 years in January, in a sign that the weaker pound is boosting export sales.The purchasing managers index for manufacturing reached 56.7 last month, up from 54.6 in December, the highest reading since 1994.In the past, when the index has been above 50, the manufacturing sector has been expanding at a faster than trend pace. The PMI has now been above this level since October.Production rose for the eighth month in a row, as new orders increased at their fastest pace in six years. The surge in new orders comes as businesses appear to have been cutting back inventories at a much slower rate over the past few months.The signs of a further pick-up in manufacturing activity is “a great way to start the year,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which compiles the report with Markit, a polling agency. He said it was “encouraging to see such strong growth and it suggests we are coming out of recession much quicker than previously feared.”However, while activity in manufacturing has been picking up, it still remains well below its pre-recession levels – leaving many businesses operating at well below full capacity.Hopes for a robust recovery in the UK economy are to some extent pinned on the decline in sterling, making British goods and services more competitive abroad and more attractive at home compared with pricier imports.The sharp increase in new export orders offers some hope that the weak pound is increasingly making itself felt, and echoes a CBI survey last month that pointed to record export demand in manufacturing.Consumer goods producers are experiencing the sharpest bounce back, with output at a level of 61.8 on the index. But investment goods at 54.1 and intermediate goods production at 57.1 are also seeing a rise in output.The report also pointed to the first increase in employment in the sector in 21 months, adding to the surprisingly positive news on the jobs market. Unemployment is near 2.5m but far below the levels many economists expected it to hit given the severity of the recession.Meanwhile, input prices are now rising almost as quickly as they were during 2006 and 2007, in a sign of the inflationary pressures that appear to be growing in the UK economy.
921;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-27T00:16:06Z;General Atlantic secures $250m Markit stake;;General Atlantic is taking a $250m stake in Markit in what amounts to a bet by one of the industry’s most experienced investors that the best future growth lies in post-trade services and data rather than in exchanges and trading platforms.The 7.5 per cent stake values Markit at just over $3bn. GA is best-known for its investments in trading venues such as Nymex, E*Trade, Saxo Bank and Archipelago – now part of NYSE Euronext. It still retains a stake in Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange.Bill Ford, chief executive of GA, said on Tuesday that it was the post-trade area that offered the most opportunities.Regulators and politicians have focused their attention on the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets in the wake of the financial crisis, with the aim of automating trading and establishing clearing systems in a bid to reduce trading risks and help stabilise the markets in any future crisis.“We see post-trade as an area for further consolidation and automation and we’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to identify opportunities,” said Mr Ford. He added that GA had felt even before the crisis that the low level of automation after trades were done had shown the area was ready for change.“We’ve always tried to identify areas that are ripe for consolidation and innovation. In the last decade we got involved with the exchange space believing there was opportunity both in ‘electronification’ and consolidation. Now we think the same is true in the market data and post-trade areas.”Markit has made its name providing credit derivatives pricing data but has been branching out into other areas, and its services now include valuations, economic and reference data, indices and trade processing. Its biggest single division is electronic trade processing – the form of back-office trade management now favoured by regulators over old-style paper-based processes.“Markit has a lot of growth ahead of it – in terms of both organic growth and in acquiring other businesses and building an even broader platform,” said Mr Ford.The company reported 2008 revenues of $348.1m and is believed to have seen that rise more than 25 per cent last year.Mr Ford has personally overseen many of GA’s market-related investments and will also join the Markit board.“Bill joining the board was an important part of the transaction for us,” said Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, who has previously described his ambition for Markit to become the “Google of the credit world”. “GA is one of the leading investment firms in financial services and having them as a partner is an affirmation of our business model,” he added.The group’s investment will be used partly to create liquidity in Markit’s extensive employee share ownership schemes, and for future investments.“I think 2010 is a year in which the financial services landscape could change quite dramatically.“I want to ensure Markit is well-positioned to be a leading participant and a company with vision,” said Mr Uggla.
922;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Blow to eurozone recovery hopes;;The eurozone’s economic recovery has run into resistance this month, according to data on Thursday that cast doubt on the pace of growth across the 16-country region.Purchasing managers’ indices for this month showed the first overall drop since they started to rebound last February, adding to fears that the robust expansion in economic activity in the second half of last year is not being maintained.The data followed a warning this week by Jürgen Stark, a European Central Bank executive board member, that growth in the first half of 2010 would be weaker than in the previous six months, although he did not foresee a “double dip” recession.January’s purchasing managers’ indices showed eurozone manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest for almost 22 months. However, service sector growth weakened and the “composite” index, covering both sectors, stood at 53.6, down from 54.2 in December. A level above 50 indicates an expansion.The eurozone economy had moved out of recession by the third quarter of 2009, when it grew 0.4 per cent. But the end of government help for car sales, weak banking sector and rising unemployment are all likely to have taken a toll on domestic demand, particularly in Germany.The crisis over Greece’s public finances has meanwhile increased financial market nervousness and helped drive the euro sharply lower.However, the latest reading did not suggest the recovery had been blown off course, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the indices. “It is a very confusing situation at the moment, but the underlying message is that there is momentum there, especially in manufacturing.”Adding more comfort, the purchasing managers’ indices again showed an easing in the pace at which jobs were being cut to the slowest since October 2008. Manufacturers, meanwhile, reported the largest increase in new orders since July 2007. Export orders rose at the same pace as in December, which was the fastest for more than two years.Economic activity in January was probably hit by the severe weather, Mr Williamson said, and the rate of growth was “in line with the average seen in the final three months of last year, which was the strongest quarter for two years”.One risk is that the indices are overstating the pace of growth. Germany’s statistical office last week reported that its economy had stagnated in the last quarter of 2009.Gilles Moec, European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the weak performance of countries such as Spain and Greece continued to drag down the eurozone’s overall prospects. But rather than the recovery going into reverse, it was seeing “a normalisation after an exceptional catch-up last summer”.
923;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-12T19:47:00Z;Sovereign bonds seen as riskier than corporates;;The cost of insuring against the risk of debt default by European nations is now higher than for top investment-grade companies for the first time, as mounting government debt prompts fears over the health of many leading economies.It now costs investors more to protect themselves against the combined risk of default of 15 developed European nations, including Germany, France and the UK, than it does for the collective risk of Europe’s top 125 investment-grade companies, according to indices compiled by data provider Markit.Markit’s iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies is trading at 63 basis points, or a cost of $63,000 to insure $10m of debt over five years. This compares with 71.5bp, or $71,500, for Markit’s SovX index of 15 European industrialised nations.Fears over sovereign risk have risen sharply in the past few months as investors have become increasingly alarmed over rising budget deficits and record levels of government bond issuance needed to pay off public debt.By contrast, hopes of a recovery have helped support corporate credit markets. Since September, the SovX index has jumped 20bp, while the iTraxx Europe index has narrowed 30bp.Bankers are even warning that big economies, such as the US and the UK, could lose their top-notch triple A status because of the deterioration in public finances.Russell Jones, head of fixed income and currency strategy research at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The US and the UK could be downgraded because of their debt levels.“ Countries, such as Greece, are in a worse position, whereas many corporates look in relatively good shape.”The cost to insure Greece, which saw its stocks and bond markets tumble on Tuesday after the European Commission said there were severe irregularities in its statistical data, has risen 140bp since September, to 263bp. This is six times more than leading companies such as Unilever, BP and Deutsche Post.Before the financial crisis, the cost to insure sovereigns was lower than corporates. In August 2007, Greek CDS traded at 11bp, while Unilever, BP and Deutsche Post all traded around 20bp.Bankers caution that liquidity in the sovereign CDS markets is still low, meaning that just a handful of buy orders can move prices sharply. Liquidity in the corporate CDS market is much higher.However, even in the highly liquid sovereign bond markets, the debt of governments, such as Greece, is cheaper than many corporates.Greek five year bond yields, which have an inverse relationship with prices, are 4.75 per cent compared with Deutsche Post’s five year bonds at 3.174 per cent, BP at 3.178 per cent and Unilever at 3.312 per cent
924;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-12T19:21:38Z;Switch in view on ‘risk-free’ nations;;"Before the old market rules were torn up by the financial crisis, investors regarded government debt as risk-free.But that does not seem to be the case any longer: for the first time, the market has started to price in a bigger probability of default among industrialised countries than among investment grade companies.More specifically, it now costs more to insure the combined risk of default of Europe’s developed nations, including Germany, France and the UK, than it does the combined risk of Europe’s top 125 investment-grade companies, according to the Markit indices.Markit’s iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies was on Tuesday trading at 63 basis points, or $63,000 to insure $10m of debt over five years. This compares with 71.5bp, or $71,500, for Markit’s SovX index of 15 European industrialised nations.This development reflects the market’s current obsession with sovereign risk. The same thing applies in the bond markets where investors are no longer willing to regard the debt of an increasing number of developed world governments as risk free. These countries have taken on huge private sector debts in their efforts to reverse the economic downturn and bail out the financial sector.John Wraith, fixed income strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, says: “The concept of what is risk free has certainly changed in as much as government bond yields of the UK and other countries are higher than some corporates.”The UK, a Group of Seven nation, has seen the cost
to insure its debt rise to double that of some of its leading companies. The UK CDS has jumped by 40bp to 83bp since September, which compares with Unilever at 29bp and BP which is 38bp.The public debt mountain in the UK has even prompted concerns that the UK could lose its prized top-notch triple A status, with all three main ratings agencies warning that its budget deficit must be reduced to avoid a downgrade.Critics warn that Markit’s SovX index is not that liquid, which means that small movements can exaggerate moves. Investors should, therefore, avoid reading too much into its 20bp rise since its launch in September.It is also important to distinguish between countries such as Greece, which has seen a sharp deterioration in its public finances, and Germany, which is still the European benchmark. German CDS has remained stable over the past few months at 27bp.However, in the highly liquid government bond markets, the story is more nuanced.Greek government bond yields are trading much higher than many investment grade corporates, but yields on UK government bonds are lower than yields of company bonds of the same maturity.UK five-year government bond yields closed at 2.75 per cent on Tuesday, much lower than Greece, which closed at 4.75 per cent. Meanwhile, the yield
on five-year bonds of Deutsche Post was 3.174 per cent, 3.178 per cent at BP and 3.312 per cent at Unilever.Huw Worthington, fixed income strategist at Barclays Capital, says: “We live in a different world since the financial crisis. Clearly, Greek bond yields are much higher relatively than Germany and are even trading above some companies.“But, in terms of what is risk free, Germany remains the benchmark. There is more divergence between the different economies with German yields much lower than Greek yields today than they were three years ago.”Mr Wraith says: “There has been a big change in perceptions as to what risk free really means, as although governments can print money and should therefore never technically be forced to default, the act of doing so could damage the currency so much that investors are left nursing big losses.”He believes it is now up to heavily indebted governments to get their finances in order. If they fail to act, there could be a sell-off in the bond markets as investors cut their government exposure .The plight of Greece, which saw its bond markets implode last month because of concerns over the credibility of its public finances (they sold off furtheron Tuesday for the same reason), is a salutary reminder to other governments of the price of failing to act."
925;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-06T22:10:16Z;Volatility eases but investors remain wary;;Global equity markets struggled to extend their recent gains on Wednesday as the latest batch of US economic releases came under keen scrutiny ahead of Friday’s crucial non-farm payrolls report.The mood of caution in the markets also came against a backdrop of fresh uncertainty about peripheral eurozone countries, a downgrade to Iceland’s credit rating and an attempt by Argentina’s president to sack the country’s central bank chief.Minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee added to the caution, as FOMC members pondered whether there might be a need to extend purchases of bonds beyond the current March deadline if the US economy were to weaken.“Day three of trading year 2010 saw investors pondering the effects of the rally and assessing economic data released since the start of the year as well as today’s FOMC minutes that signalled economic recovery that’s likely sustainable but short of rock n’roll,” said analysts at Ticonderoga Securities.More encouraging signs for investors came from a further tightening of credit spreads on both sides of the Atlantic.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credit default swaps fell below 400bp, a level last seen in May 2008, while the investment-grade Markit CDX North America index touched a two-year low.The Vix volatility index, a key measure of risk aversion often described as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell to a 16-month low of 18.83 but crept up again to 19.15 after the FOMC minutes.The news on the US economy on Wednesday was broadly positive, although the employment report due on Friday remained uppermost in investors’ minds. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index rose to 50.1 in December – signalling expansion in the crucial services sector – from 48.7 in November. The employment sub-index of the report recovered to 44.0 from 41.6.“This measure has lost some predictive power for the non-farm payroll change in recent months, and the manufacturing employment index, now in expansionary territory, has been a more accurate indicator,” said Kim Whelan, economic analyst at Wells Fargo.Meanwhile, ADP Employer Services said the US private sector had shed 84,000 jobs last month, down from a revised 145,000 in November but slightly more than analysts had expected.US equities largely shrugged off the day’s figures and the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher. The main indices in Europe and Japan closed at 15-month highs, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 inching up 0.1 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rising 0.5 per cent, while emerging market stocks touched a 17-month peak.US government bonds retreated following Tuesday’s hefty rally as uncertainty about the jobs data kicked in. The 10-year Treasury yield was up 8bp at 3.84 per cent, while the German Bund yield rose 1bp to 3.38 per cent after the sale of €4.9bn ($7bn) of 10-year paper. The two-year UK gilt fell 2bp to 1.3 per cent amid strong demand at the sale of £4bn ($6.4bn) of five-year notes.There was relatively little impact on Greek government bonds from reported comments by Jürgen Stark, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, that the markets were “deluding themselves” if they thought European Union member states would bail out Greece.The remarks reignited fears about the fiscal health of Greece and briefly drove the single currency below $1.43, although it later recovered. Andrew Wilkinson at Interactive Brokers described Wednesday’s news as little more than a “storm in a teacup”.“Mr Stark’s comment …is possibly intended to spur Greek officials to ensure its report, and plan to Brussels, before the end of January is watertight,” he said.Meanwhile, the dollar gained ground against the yen following the resignation of Hirohisa Fujii, Japan’s finance minister, for health reasons but the US currency later lost some ground after the FOMC minutes.In commodities, oil prices touched a 14-month high above $83 a barrel. Copper reached a 16-month peak and gold hit its highest for three weeks.
926;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-06T18:48:31Z;European CDS reach lowest for two years;;European credit derivatives indices reached levels not seen since before the bail-out of Bear Stearns in a further sign of the strengthening of credit markets.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of credit default swaps of 50 junk-rated borrowers traded below 400 basis points on Wednesday to reach 396bp, a level not seen since January 7 2008.“Trading levels highlight the extent to which credit as an asset class continues to see inflows,” said Arran Rowsell, head of European flow credit trading at Credit Suisse. The Markit iTraxx main Europe index of 125 investment grade borrowers’ CDS traded as low as 68.5bp, a level not seen since May 19 2008, after the bail-out of the US bank in March.The indices are key indicators of market sentiment towards corporate credit. “There has been a big appetite to own credit through the year and generally investors are more comfortable with corporate risk exposure,” said Francesco Garzarelli, director of macro and markets research at Goldman Sachs.
927;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-05T20:18:15Z;UK construction industry remains in slump;;Construction activity fell in December for the 22nd month in a row as a surge in housing was offset by a sharp decline in commercial building.The construction purchasing managers’ index rose slightly to 47.1 from 47 last month, where any level below 50 signals a drop in business activity.The downturn in the construction sector began in February of 2008, according to the index, which is compiled by polling company Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply.Although the slowdown in the sector has eased markedly since February 2009, when the PMI reached a record low of 27.3, the weakness last month continues a pattern of only limited signs of recovery.“December was another disappointing month for the UK construction sector. Unlike other parts of the economy, it seems unable to escape the shackles of the recession,” said David Noble, chief executive of Cips. “Purchasing managers painted a bleak picture as firms suffered from reduced client demand and falls in new business.”On the up side, housebuilding activity rose at its fastest pace since the early days of the credit crisis in August 2007, hitting a level of 58.9, compared with 53 in November. This comes as the housing market has seen signs of sharp rises in prices and buyer interest after a deep slump that bottomed out early last year.But commercial construction declined by the most since April, falling back from a level of 46.1 to 41.1. That caused new orders for construction to slow down, after a small rise in November. Employment in the sector is also still falling rapidly, although the pace of decline in jobs was slightly less marked in the month, reaching a level of 41.3, up from 40 the previous month.Despite the mixed picture in the sector, business confidence increased, recovering after a dip in November. Expectations for future levels of business are now riding not far below their pre-crisis levels.“Purchasing managers also remain confident that 2010 will be a much better year for the construction sector and that it will begin to grow again,” Mr Noble said. “However, whether this optimism is based on hope rather than foresight on orders in the pipeline remains to be seen.”The continued weakness in the sector suggests that construction is unlikely to have offered a major boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Construction only makes up about 6 per cent of national output, but its rapid pace of decline during the credit crisis – which hit the ability and desire of investors to put money into property – gave it a disproportionate role in the recession.Construction output actually rose in the second and third quarter of last year, according to official statistics, but that has almost entirely been the result of a big pick up in public construction – possibly reflecting government spending brought forward as part of the fiscal stimulus package. Meanwhile, private housebuilding, commercial and industrial output fell in the third quarter, although the decline had begun to reverse in September and October.“Serious concerns and uncertainties persist over the prospects for the commercial property sector in particular,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. “Over the long term, the construction sector will be hit by the government’s need to significantly rein in its spending for an extended period, as this is bound to hit expenditure on infrastructure and public buildings.”
928;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2010-01-04T10:39:52Z;China and India lead Asian economic rebound;;Asia’s rapid recovery from last year’s recession appeared to be confirmed on Monday by a slew of positive reports on industrial production that suggested economic growth is powering steadily ahead, led by China and India.Even a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter contraction in Singapore’s gross domestic product failed to dampen the optimistic mood, with economists writing off the setback in the city-state as a consequence of pharmaceutical industry volatility.Purchasing managers’ index reports for China, South Korea, Taiwan and India appeared to confirm that a robust and widespread recovery continues to be under way.The China Manufacturing PMI, produced by HSBC and Markit Economics, rose to 56.1 in December, up from 55.7 a month earlier – the second fastest rise yet recorded by the survey, which dates back to 2004. The average rise for the fourth quarter of 2009 as a whole was also the fastest yet recorded.The closely watched survey pointed to a ninth consecutive monthly expansion in new order volume, with companies reporting buoyant demand in both domestic and export markets. The growth in export orders was the fastest since March 2005, reinforcing a positive trend that began in the second half of last year.The HSBC index confirmed the strong trend suggested by the official PMI numbers, released on January 1, which showed manufacturing activity expanding in December at the fastest pace for 20 months. The two series are not directly comparable because they use different methodology.However, the HSBC date also signalled that prices charged by Chinese manufacturers were rising at the fastest rate since July 2008, buoyed by rising raw material costs as well as strong demand.Grace Ng, economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, said the two PMI series taken together suggested that China’s manufacturing sector was experiencing a strong recovery, supported by broad-based demand growth.“The manufacturing order to inventory ratio continued to stay at about the highest level since April 2008, suggesting that, with further steady recovery in final demand conditions, solid sequential trend growth in the manufacturing sector will continue in the coming months,” she said.The India Manufacturing PMI, compiled by HSBC and Markit, rose from 53 to 55.6, its highest level since May, when it hit 55.7, the strongest performance of 2009. The positive result was helped by a big rise in the sub-index for new orders, which rose to 60.1, the highest for the year, from 54.6 in November.The India PMI has now been above the neutral level of 50 for nine consecutive months, indicating a sustained period of expansion, following a five-month period when it suggested that output was contracting.HSBC said the detailed December survey data suggested that growth was the strongest for 15 months, driven by better economic conditions and business investment. Demand from both domestic and foreign buyers was higher than in November, although the home market remained the principal driver of new business expansion.The data will ease concerns that India’s manufacturing sector might have been slowing, although HSBC said many companies remained cautious about the durability of the country’s economic recovery.The South Korea manufacturing PMI, also produced by HSBC, edged up slightly in December to 52.8 from 52.6 in November, indicating a continued expansion of the economy, although the pace appeared to be slowing.The sub-index for total new orders fell from 54.1 to 52.9, and the index for new export orders declined from 52.4 to 50.7. However, both remain in positive territory. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the index, with any figure below 50 indicating a decline.In Taiwan, the manufacturing PMI, produced by HSBC and Markit, moved upwards for the ninth successive month, reaching 58.7 from 58.4 in November. The index showed strong demand in both export and domestic markets, although the rate of increase in new orders edged downwards.In Singapore, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said the economy contracted by 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted annualised quarter-by-quarter basis. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, the economy grew by 3.5 per cent. It declined by 2.1 per cent for 2009 as a whole, in line with government and private sector expectations.The MTI said the fourth-quarter setback was caused by a 38.4 per cent contraction in the manufacturing sector, on a quarter-by-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, following an expansion of 29.6 per cent in the third quarter.The ministry said the decline was mainly due to a contraction in the output of the biomedical and transport engineering industries. Electronics, chemicals and precision engineering posted positive growth.Robert Prior-Wandesford, economist at HSBC in Singapore, said the numbers did not signal a return to recession, even though the quarter-by-quarter contraction was larger than consensus forecasts.“Pharma production is notoriously volatile, as companies often shut temporarily to swap product lines, and is likely to bounce back strongly in early 2010. Production will also be boosted as a couple of new facilities are set to open during the year,” he said.In Tokyo, Yukio Hatoyama, the Japanese prime minister, said his top priority was to stop the economy slipping back into recession by passing budget bills for the current financial year and the next.“With the feeling that the economy must not be allowed to go into a double dip, that we will not allow it to do so …we compiled emergency measures and a second extra budget at the end of last year,” Mr Hatoyama told reporters.“We want to bring this second extra budget into effect as soon as possible,” he said, adding that next year’s budget should also be dealt with quickly. Japan’s financial year runs to the end of March.The only dark cloud was in Australia, where the Australian Industry Group - PriceWaterhouseCoopers Performance of Manufacturing Index fell 2.7 points to 48.5, just below the 50 point level that separates expansion from contraction.The fall reflected modest falls in production and input deliveries and a marginal decline in new orders. Inventories rose a little while employment grew slightly for a second month reflecting the lagging impact of recent higher activity.PWC said the findings illustrated the tenuous nature of the recovery in manufacturing as it contended with a high exchange rate, moderate growth in domestic demand and a weak global economy. The Australian dollar has weakened slightly in recent weeks, but is about 11 per cent higher against the US dollar over six months, driven by the strength of the economy and Canberra’s aggressive monetary policy.
929;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-12-31T17:25:24Z;Matthew Vincent: Resolve to repay;;How are you getting on with those New Year resolutions? If you are reading this on day two of your new jogging/ celery munching/nicotine craving regime, don’t worry about it. Psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire say it is quite normal for nine out ten of us to give up giving up/cutting down/working out in the first few days of January. Those who do keep on keeping on never make it past 77 days anyway, according to the insurer PruHealth (‘Death of the Diet Day’ is March 18, if you’re looking to pencil dinner dates in to your new dairy). But those who don’t bother at all end up healthier, mentally, as they avoid feelings of failure and worthlessness, according to the charity Mind. So, go on, lighten up… or stop lightening up…or just light up.If, however, you are reading this on day two of your new financial planning regime, do worry about it. Researchers at the credit reference agency Equifax have found that nearly two thirds of us will make financial resolutions for 2010 and, for six out of ten, “reducing debt” is a priority before building up savings. Those who tried last year found that paying off didn’t pay off, according to Unbiased.co.uk (non-mortgage debt levels at the end of the third quarter were nearly double the level on 1 January 2009). But many didn’t bother at all, according to the Markit/YouGov Household Finance Index, which registered another increase in debt in December. So, is it time to just give up?No. Behavioural economics experts at Yale University have found that financial ‘commitment contracts’ can be a highly effective tool in helping people to lose weight, give up smoking, pay off debts or save money. All you need is a financial stake that you agree to lose (or donate to charity) if you fail to meet your commitment, a referee to check on your progress, and supporters to help you reach your goal.With £4bn of personal debt to clear, the financial stakes are already high. What we need are strong supporters, to provide added encouragement. I have a few in mind…● The Department of Work and Pensions. With the new ‘personal accounts’ pension scheme delayed until 2016, why not introduce the government- sponsored debt-repayment scheme that I outlined at the end of last year: allow employers to divert their pension contributions, matched by employees’ payments, into a debt-repayment scheme for a few years, on the understanding that employees will then pay the same amount into a pension?● The Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Having quietly dropped the investigation into banks’ “unfair” overdraft fees, why not champion the responsible in 2010, rather than the irresponsible? Go after “unfair” early repayment charges on loans and mortgages instead.● The Investment Management Association. Having admitted that “costs matter in investment”, on these very pages, why not incorporate the FT Money Fund Fees Manifesto , calling for full disclosure of all fund management costs, into your submission to The Committee of European Securities Regulators on “greater clarity and disclosure”?If you support these ideas, let me know.

930;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
931;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-11-23T18:04:57Z;Growth fears cloud eurozone rebound;;"The eurozone recovery is gathering pace in the final months of 2009, but warning signs of weaker growth next year have appeared.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 16-country region on Monday showed private sector activity expanding this month at the fastest rate in two years, with France and Germany powering the revival. However, the survey also pointed to a loss of momentum in coming months.The results add to evidence that the eurozone has returned to expansion, but that it risks seeing growth fade once government and central bank support measures are ended. The results are likely to add to policymakers’ wariness about the outlook for 2010.In a speech in Madrid, Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, said: “We can spot a number of signs of stabilisation. But the crisis has debilitated the real economy . . . [and has] proved so deep because it has deprived our citizens of
confidence.”The eurozone recession ended in the third quarter, when gross domestic product rose by 0.4 per cent.November’s purchasing managers’ indices suggest the fourth quarter will see growth of a similar pace or faster. The composite index, covering eurozone services and manufacturing, reached 53.7 in November, up from 53.0 in October, making it the fourth consecutive month of expansion.However, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey, said November “also saw the first signs of growth peaking”. New orders grew at a slower rate than in October, especially in the service sector. Job losses remained high and “highlighted the fragility of the recovery”, he added.A bright spot was an acceleration in growth of new export orders reported by eurozone manufacturers. This suggests that the strong euro is having less effect than feared. Companies cited increased trade within the eurozone and improving global market conditions, Markit said.The indices continued to show France outpacing its larger neighbour, in contrast with the most recent GDP data, which showed the German economy growing by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter while France managed 0.3 per cent.The difference could be explained by government spending, which is not covered by the PMI. The GDP data could also be revised."
932;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Bank of England printer jam;;"Warning: paper jam! The Bank of England will inject a further £25bn into the economy, mainly through purchases of gilts. The quantitative easing programme is soon to hit the £200bn mark, more than 13 per cent of gross domestic product. The bank’s hyperactivity reflects the fact that it controls the only lever left to policymakers; the bleak state of the public finances gives zero scope for fresh fiscal stimulus. While it sees signs the economy may soon recover, it expects any revival to be slow; credit is tight as banks rebuild balance sheets, and there remains a substantial margin of under-utilised capacity resulting from the 6 per cent fall in output experienced over the past six quarters.Other central banks are either devising their exit strategies or raising interest rates – the Federal Reserve on Wednesday implicitly set out the factors that would lead to a rate rise, while the European Central Bank is expected to begin discussions on a gradual dismantling of emergency measures. But the UK is still flat on its back. That at least was the evidence from the 0.4 per cent fall in third-quarter GDP. Other indicators have been more encouraging. October’s UK CIPS/Markit report on services echoed the upbeat tone of Monday’s manufacturing survey. The rise in unemployment seems to be topping out. The property bubble is re-inflating. Equity markets have held on to strong gains.Investors are right to take no chances, protecting themselves against a more rapid resurgence of inflation. Impatience for tangible signs of commitment to a timely reduction in the fiscal deficit and public debt mountain is growing. Look at the yield on the 10-year gilt, for example. This has risen by about half a percentage point in the past month alone, hitting 3.84 per cent on Thursday. Every percentage point increase in the government’s borrowing costs adds about £15bn to the chancellor’s interest bill. If long-term rates continue to rise at this pace until the election, shadow chancellor George Osborne will drown in debt service payments.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter"
933;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-11-01T22:55:40Z;Markit creates e-trade loan platform;;Markit, the financial information provider, has acquired ClearPar of the US to create a platform that for the first time will allow banks and investors to process loan trades electronically from start to finish.The move is intended to help reduce counterparty and operational risk in a market with $1,000bn of loans outstanding.The acquisition of the loan settlement platform by London-headquartered Markit – which describes itself as the Google of the credit world – highlights a shift in international debt markets towards a more efficient and transparent loan market.Loan trading volumes are vast and expected to grow. Volumes were estimated at $132bn in North America and at €20bn ($29bn) in Europe in the second quarter of 2009 alone.However, in spite of the boom in loan issuance and trading in recent years, the market’s infrastructure remains one of the least sophisticated.This shortcoming has provoked growing unease from some regulators, which fear it could create a new threat to the smooth functioning of markets. It has also limited the pool of traders, since some funds cannot cope with the logistics associated with the manual processes involved.“Even today, loan trades are settled on a manual basis,” said Armins Rusis, global co-head of fixed income at Markit.“Only 30 per cent of par loans in the US settle in the recommended seven days. Closing loans is costly and time consuming, which doesn’t create an incentive for new investors to enter the asset class.”In Europe, loan trades take on average up to 40 days to settle. This presents a problem for investors who have seen wide swings in loan prices, which historically have been stable, as a result of the financial crisis.“This will have a large and positive impact on the credit markets. There are billions of dollars locked up in trades that have yet to settle,” said Kevin Corgan, head of high-yield trading at JPMorgan. “Regulators should be happy about this as well, as it will speed up settlement and decrease operational risks in loan trading.”Markit will combine the ClearPar platform, through which banks settle trades, with Markit WSO, which is used by loan investors, connecting loan market participants electronically for the first time.Matthew Craston, co-head leverage loans at European Credit Management, said: “Loans could overtake the bond market in terms of the flow of funds and make it comparatively more attractive to investors if settlement terms were improved.”Many brokers have launched trading platforms in a bid to increase transparency in loan markets.Guy Butler, a specialist credit trading firm, has joined Thomson Reuters to create DealView Axe, where sellers can post positions for sale and allow them to find counterparties with which to switch positions.lliquidX, an independent London-based boutique that specialises in trading illiquid debt instruments, has launched a platform where sellers can post loans or other credit assets for sale.“We expect commercial banks to begin to focus more on lending to their home countries and to industries they feel comfortable with and, as a result, will want to switch around loan positions to help manage their balance sheets more effectively than in the past,” said Dennis Buckley of Guy Butler.
934;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-29T19:14:30Z;Conflicting data challenge Bank;;Last week’s official data showing the UK still mired in its longest recession since the war came as a big shock to economists. Goldman Sachs described the figures as “Unbelievable. Literally.”Reconciling this picture with apparently abundant, albeit tentative, signs of recovery will be the task of an anonymous but influential group meeting on Friday in the bowels of the Bank of England.On the Friday before the MPC’s official meeting the Bank pulls its economists together for what is known as the pre-monetary policy committee meeting. It is here that MPC members crunch the data that will inform their next moves.The meeting’s task on Friday will be even more challenging than usual: is Britain’s economy beginning to grow again, as private surveys suggest, or is it still contracting in line with the official data?The surveys giving consistently the strongest signals that Britain is emerging from recession have been those of the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index, or PMI. The Bank has long viewed this index as the most reliable of all private sector surveys.Research by the Bank shows that PMI data for the services and manufacturing sectors, with a six-month lag, have the highest positive correlation with gross domestic product of any survey. “If you did a horse race between the surveys, then the PMI would come out on top,” says Simon Hayes, joint author of this research.That may go some way towards explaining why economists reacted with incredulity to the official GDP data last week. Goldman Sachs forecasts that they will ultimately be revised sharply upwards.However, other economists point to weaknesses in the way private sector surveys are carried out. For example, the PMI sample surveys roughly 600 companies in the manufacturing and services sectors.“The ONS [Office of National Statistics] samples 35,000 companies,” says Danny Gabbay, economist at Fathom Securities. “Where was it mandated that you should put so much weight on one particular survey?”PMI surveys predicted recessions in 1998, 2001 and 2003, he says – years in which the economy continued to grow.While the third quarter official GDP figure may indeed be revised, it could just as easily be downwards as up, Mr Hayes says.Looking at revisions to preliminary growth estimates over the past 15 years, the initial figure has turned out to be too low when it showed expansion of 0.3 per cent or more over the quarter. But when initial growth estimates are weaker than this, revision has often been downward.Another explanation for the discrepancy may be the nature of the questions asked by different surveys. While PMI, CBI and British Chamber of Commerce surveys generally ask whether conditions are improving, stable or getting worse, the ONS asks for absolute levels of turnover.The National Institute for Economic and Social Research found that the answers pointed in the same direction in surveys by the CBI and ONS, but differed in degree. “For those reporting that things got better, things might have only got a little better, but for those who found they got worse, they may have been dire,” says Martin Weale, NIESR director.Surveys such as the PMI and CBI are not well placed to capture that nuance, Mr Weale says.
935;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-29T18:10:14Z;Markit forecasts revenue surge;;Revenues at Markit are expected to grow more than 20 per cent next year, underlining the ongoing strong demand for market data and services in spite of the effects of the financial crisis.The financial information provider is also forecasting its revenues will have risen about 25 per cent this year with growth of 30 per cent in its earnings before accounting-related charges.Markit is best-known as a credit pricing service, but that business only accounts for 10 per cent of its revenue, highlighting how some service providers to the financial sector are seizing on the opportunities thrown up by the crisis to push into new areas in the over-the-counter markets.In the wake of the turmoil, regulators around the world are pushing for greater standardisation and transparency of the vast OTC markets, forcing industry insiders to push forward with electronic solutions that might otherwise have taken years to have become established.Markit reported a net loss of $85.1m last year on revenues of $348.1m, according to papers filed at Companies House in the UK this week.The loss was largely due to accounting-related charges such as goodwill amortisation, much of which resulted from a restructuring of the business into a new holding company.However, the company did take an $80m impairment charge against the value of Boat, the OTC equities data company. Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, said the write-off was the only one in the company’s history and reflected the fact that competition in the sector had slashed margins on price data“Given the changes that occurred since the acquisition, we felt that the price paid was too high and a write down required,” he said.Markit bought three more companies last year and one so far this year, underlining its strategy of moving into new areas and developing products based on those markets using its previous experience. This has added to its large goodwill amortisation charges.Last year it acquired NTC Economics, which provides macro-economic indicators, Swapswire, an electronic derivatives trade confirmation network, and FCS, a provider of loan market risk management software.“We help bridge financial communities,” said Mr Uggla. “In the credit world we have developed a Google type brand but to be the company we strive to be, all our products need this level of recognition.”In a sign of the beneficial effects of the crisis, Markit’s single largest division, responsible for 20 per cent of its revenues, is electronic trade processing – which is rapidly replacing the cumbersome, paper-based systems the OTC markets have traditionally relied on.
936;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-25T16:14:08Z;Eurozone recovery leaves UK behind;;Prospects for European economic recovery became more confused on Friday after official data showed the UK still mired in its longest recession since the second world war, at the same time as a eurozone survey was much more upbeat about recovery in continental Europe.Powered largely by France, eurozone private sector activity appeared to expand this month at its fastest rate for almost two years, according to purchasing managers’ indices for the region.The results boosted hopes that the second half of this year had seen a sustainable rebound, with government and central bank actions helping to avert a slide back into recession.Morgan Stanley believes the eurozone could have expanded by as much as 0.9 per cent in the third quarter, after a 0.2 per cent contraction in the second quarter – thanks largely to companies destocking less aggressively than before.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at Unicredit, said: “It’s time to learn to stop worrying and love the recovery, enjoy the strength of the current upswing – and prepare for the less exciting track ahead of us.”Such a sentiment was absent across the English Channel, where the UK has also enjoyed strength in the equivalent survey in recent months. Widespread hopes of growth in the third quarter were dashed as the Office for National Statistics said the economy contracted by 0.4 per cent in its preliminary estimate.Weakness in oil and gas extraction, distribution, restaurants and construction prevented the UK economy expanding and left the government with the difficult task of explaining how it has presided over the longest recession since the 1940s with the downturn now on a par with that of the 1980s.Alistair Darling, UK chancellor, insisted his predictions were still on track: “I have always been clear that growth will return at the end of the year as my Budget forecast assumed.”But many economists questioned whether the official figures were plausible in light of stronger labour market, survey and production data. Kevin Daly of Goldman Sachs said the initial gross domestic product figures were routinely revised so much the contraction was “unbelievable. Literally.” He added: “Amazingly, if one wants to know in real time what is happening in the UK economy, it has been better to follow the eurozone’s early GDP estimates than the UK’s GDP estimates.”October’s eurozone purchasing managers’ indices were consistent with quarterly GDP growth of about 0.4 per cent, according to Markit, which publishes the survey.France appeared to be enjoying a broader recovery. Its composite purchasing managers’ index, covering industry and services, leapt from 54.8 in September to 58.4, the highest for almost three years.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “In France there is a greater air of confidence among businesses and households that we are very much over the worst.”For the eurozone, the composite index rose from 51.1 last month to 53.0. With a figure above 50 indicating an expansion in activity, it marked the third consecutive month of growth and the strongest monthly gain since December 2007.The evidence of a sustained, if gradual, eurozone economic recovery could result in the European Central Bank adopting a less cautious stance.Striking an upbeat tone, Axel Weber, Germany’s Bundesbank president, and Ewald Nowotny, his Austrian counterpart – who both sit on the ECB’s governing council – this week said a eurozone “double dip” recession was unlikely.
937;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-24T00:18:17Z;Hairpin bends in road ahead;;"Recovery Watch had the sensation on Friday of witnessing a nasty accident as it glanced into its rear-view mirror.GDP data, which are backward-looking by definition, showed Britain’s economy was not yet heading out of recession – but the road ahead also conceals hairpin bends.The tone of business and economic news was far more downbeat this week than last. Even in the bright spots, clouds were gathering.The employers’ federation, the CBI, produced its most positive assessment of export prospects in 14 years. But it also said the cost of finance was a bigger barrier to investment than at any time since October 1992, when Bank rates were at 8 per cent.The British Bankers’ Association reported a sharp fall in lending to private non-financial companies in September. At £3.9bn ($6.4bn), this was more than three times the average decline of the previous six months.Tight access to credit is also hitting households. Provident Financial, the subprime lender, said it was refusing eight out of 10 applications for credit cards.BBA data show that repayments on credit cards substantially outstrip new borrowings – which may help to explain why retail sales for September were flat when economists had forecast a rise.However, company profits on both sides of the Atlantic are surprisingly strong, notwithstanding analysts’ warnings that this is more about tighter cost control than revenue growth.On an optimistic view of this trend, research from Markit suggests companies are sharing the gains with investors; the average dividend pay-out is expected to rise 8 per cent in 2010 after falling sharply last year.On the minus side, there are signs that UK investors fear profit growth is limited. Capita Registrars, which registers transactions in more than 2,000 UK and Irish shares, noted that sales outstripped purchases in August and September after the reverse trend had prevailed for the previous nine months.Thus Recovery Watch has its work cut out to live up to its name. Even with a sharp rebound – unlikely after the latest data – the economy would have to grow strongly for a long time to even recover the ground it has lost."
938;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
939;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-05T19:32:33Z;US services sector grows in September;;The US service sector grew in September for the first time in a year amid signs of broadening economic recovery.The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index rose to 50.9 per cent in September from 48.5 per cent in August, beating expectations. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.It was the first time the index showed growth since August 2008 and the highest reading since May 2008. Service industries represent about 80 per cent of the US economy. The US figures followed earlier data showing a pick-up in global economic activity. JPMorgan’s global purchasing managers’ index grew for the second consecutive month in September, rising to 52.9 from 52.0, although a sub-index of global employment dipped to 46.0 from 46.1.Growth in the UK service sector accelerated at the fastest pace in two years, while the eurozone service sector grew for the first time since May 2008, according to surveys from CIPS/Markit. But job losses also continued to mount in Europe as the UK recorded the 17th consecutive month of job losses, while eurozone job cuts accelerated after easing in August.“The ongoing weakness in the employment readings of the [UK] PMIs serves as a reminder that firms remain cautious about hiring despite an upswing in output growth”, said Allan Monks of JPMorgan Chase Bank.In the US, economists said the return to growth was encouraging after last week’s news that US unemployment hit a 26-year high and the growth of manufacturing activity slowed.But they warned that recovery in the service sector remained weak as employment continued to rise. “While some further drift upward is likely, we do not expect this indicator to flash a sustained ‘all-clear’ signal any time soon”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Economists were most positive about strong growth in US business activity, new orders and orders backlog. Business activity grew faster than in August at 55.1 per cent, and new orders rose to 54.2 per cent after 11 months of contraction. The backlog of orders surged 10.5 percentage points to 51.5 per cent.But employment continued to contract, though at a slower rate than in August. The sub-index rose less than 1 percentage point to 44.3, a reading that Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS, called “stubbornly soft”.“The employment balance remains weak and is roughly consistent with service sector payroll employment continuing to fall by around 100,000 per month”, said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.Overall, five industries reported growth in September, while 13 reported contraction.Growth in the manufacturing sector continues to outpace that in services. Last week, the ISM said its manufacturing index slipped to 52.6, registering growth for the second month running, as production and new orders continued to benefit from the impact of government stimulus measures.The gap “suggest[s] that the economic recovery is less entrenched in the areas that are less exposed to the fiscal stimulus, the rebound in world trade and the fall in the dollar”, Mr Dales said. “Once the initial burst to growth from these factors fades, we fear that the US economy will be left without much forward momentum.”
940;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-05T09:21:26Z;Services sector growth at two-year high;;The services sector grew at the fastest pace in two years in September, in a sign that the recovery in the largest part of the economy is still going strong, even if the manufacturing sector has stumbled slightly.The purchasing managers’ index for activity in service businesses rose to 55.3 from 54.1, where a level above 50 is consistent with companies reporting a rise in activity compared with the previous month.The monthly index, compiled by polling company Markit, has been showing increasing activity for the past five months.Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics said the figures pointed to quarterly growth in services output of about 0.7 per cent. Although the manufacturing and construction activity indices dropped in September, an average of the three surveys suggests that the economy grew by 0.3 per cent or 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, she said.Official figures for growth, however, have been delivering weaker readings than the business surveys in recent quarters – with the Office of National Statistics reporting a 0.6 per cent contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter when the purchasing managers index had suggested the UK economy was performing significantly better.The service sector data showed that activity saw the strongest rise last month since September 2007 – near the beginning of the financial crisis. The improvement in activity in the sector is also expected to be maintained – with business expectations for the next 12 months at a two-and-a-half-year high.Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which also produces the report, said that in spite of the continued growth “there remained evidence of excess resources in the sector” as companies again reduced backlogs of existing work at a marked pace.This helped to deliver a further fall in jobs in the sector during the month, the 17th decline in row, and is likely to add to fears that job losses may continue for some time even if the economy returns to growth.There is also a disparity between sub-sectors in the recovery. While growth was “particularly marked” in hotels and restaurants and business-to-business services, activity fell in transport and storage.The weaker employment figures come after both the manufacturing and construction purchasing managers indices slipped back, raising fears that the initial recovery from the downturn is petering out.“Today’s reading clearly points to the services sector returning to positive growth in the third quarter, having contracted since [the second quarter of 2008],” said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“Going forward, we remain concerned as to the durability of the current nascent recovery – this given our doubts over the private sector being able to offset the fading stimulus from the fiscal sector, not to mention the tighter budgetary stance that looks inevitable before too long.“Among all of the markets that we cover the UK is the clearest candidate for a double-dip of ‘W-shaped’ growth profile owing to the scale of its imbalances.”
941;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-10-02T13:34:05Z;ECB chief signals concerns on euro;;Heightened concern at the euro’s strength was signalled on Thursday by Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, as a survey indicated the currency’s rise was hitting eurozone export and growth prospects.Escalating his rhetoric on global exchange rates, Mr Trichet warned at a meeting of European finance ministers in Gothenberg, Sweden, that “disorderly movements” would have “adverse implications” for economies. His comments, which pushed the euro lower on Thursday, pointed to ECB concern that the currency’s rise is adding to the threats facing the eurozone’s still-fragile recovery – an issue European policymakers are expected to bring up at this weekend’s meeting of G7 industrial nations in Istanbul.The eurozone purchasing managers’ index for the manufacturing sector rose from 48.2 in August to 49.3 in September, the highest for 16 months, according to revised figures on Thursday. But the survey suggested growth remained lacklustre, with significant differences between countries.Growth was fastest in French manufacturing, but appeared to lose momentum in Germany and, especially, Spain. Overall, exports “failed to show anything more than a very marginal rise as competitiveness continued to be hit by the strong euro”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.The euro reached a one-year high last week of almost $1.48 against the dollar, having risen steadily this year on a trade-weighted index basis.European Union finance ministers, meeting informally in Gothenberg on Thursday, discussed the unwinding of economic stimulus measures but appeared equivocal about the timing of such exit strategies.Anders Borg, Sweden’s finance minister, said the EU was “now seeing the green leaves” of economic recovery but progress still depended on “economic fertilisers”. EU officials had earlier said stimulus measures should start to be removed when “recovery takes hold” and no later than 2011.
942;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-09-23T21:33:44Z;Eurozone growth pick-up appears fragile;;Eurozone economic growth has picked up further this month, securing the region’s escape from recession, but the pace of recovery could be losing momentum, according to a survey.September’s purchasing managers’ indices for the 16-country region showed a second consecutive monthly expansion in private sector economic activity. However, the improvement was less than expected and the survey indicated that job cuts were being accelerated. France appeared to be powering much of the growth – while Germany’s recovery lost tempo.The results strengthen the European Central Bank’s case that the eurozone’s economic recovery remains highly fragile and at risk of going into reverse. “We are very cautious still. There is a lot of uncertainty,” ECB governing council member Erkii Liikanen told the Financial Times in an interview conducted before the latest data.The ECB is widely expected to keep its main interest rate at the record low of 1 per cent well into next year. Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, has made clear that the central bank has an “exit strategy” to unwind the exceptional measures it has taken to combat the crisis. But Mr Liikanen, who is governor of Finland’s central bank, said: “We are not in a hurry now. If you look at growth in Europe, it is about to recover – but clearly from a lower level.”Eurozone economic activity contracted faster than in the US and UK at the end of last year and in the first quarter of 2009, as its exporters reeled from the loss of global confidence in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. But the region appears to have recovered more quickly – in part because eurozone consumers were less indebted and less affected by tumbling house prices. Eurozone gross domestic product contracted by just 0.1 per cent in the second quarter.The latest purchasing managers’ indices pointed to growth stabilising in the third quarter of this year and a stronger performance in the final three months. “However, the momentum of the rebound is showing some signs of waning, with an increase in the rate of job losses in September particularly disappointing,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the information group that produces the survey. As well as rising unemployment, the strong euro could also act as a brake on growth.The composite eurozone index, covering manufacturing and services, rose from 50.4 in August to 50.8 in September – the highest for 16 months. A reading of 50 marks the divide between expanding and contracting private sector activity. Having slowed in the previous four months, the pace of eurozone job losses picked up in September, according to Markit.France’s composite index jumped from 51.3 to 53.9 – the highest for 18 months. However, Germany’s index dropped from 54.0 to 52.2.
943;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-09-03T19:23:09Z;Service sector growth accelerates;;The service sector grew at its fastest pace in almost two years in August, leaving the UK economy on track to return to growth in the third quarter.The purchasing managers’ index for business activity at services companies rose to 54.1 from 53.2 in July, where the level of 50 is consistent with trend growth. It is the highest level since September 2007.The services PMI covers about 40 per cent of the economy. It excludes retail, car sales and government services, but retail sales have been growing and government output is unlikely to have declined much.Coming after purchasing managers’ reports for the manufacturing sector that pointed to a small renewed decline in activity and a less rapid contraction in construction, the business surveys covering two-thirds of the quarter suggest that the economy has bottomed out, but it will be a further two months before official data can confirm that.“The latest services data leave the UK economy on track for growth in the third quarter, although there will remain doubts over the sustainability of expansion,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit, which compiles the report.Capital Economics said that the survey suggested “the biggest part of the economy is continuing to enjoy a decent recovery”.A composite measure of the three indices reached 54.3, in line with the average in the uninterrupted dec­ade of expansion before the financial crisis. If growth does not stall in September, the PMIs are consistent with growth of about 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, says Markit.The UK services PMI is also ahead of similar measures across the euro area and in Japan and the US.There are questions, however, on how good a guide the surveys are to the path of official data. Despite the better UK results in the business survey, Germany, France and Japan returned to growth in the second quarter, while the UK sank to a deeper-than-expected 0.8 per cent contraction in gross domestic product.Fears remained, also, over whether the pick-up can be maintained beyond a boost from a decline in shedding of inventories and as the UK’s fiscal deficit becomes more perilous.Services businesses said growth was supported by a larger decline in backlogs of existing work, new orders growing at a slightly slower pace, and extensive discounting to boost sales.“We remain concerned that the legacy of the imbalances besetting the UK economy [specifically, a dearth of household savings and an increasingly burdensome structural budget deficit] will ensure that any recovery will prove anaemic,” said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.But Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said he saw signs of a “self-sustaining upturn”.
944;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-09-03T09:58:09Z;Eurozone PMI bounces back to growth;;Eurozone private sector economic activity returned to growth last month for the first time in more than a year, highlighting the momentum behind the 16-country region’s rebound.The eurozone “composite” purchasing managers’ index, covering service and manufacturing industries, leapt from 47.0 in July to 50.4 in August. It was the first time since May 2008 that the index has been above the 50 level, which marks the border between expanding and contracting activity. An earlier “flash” estimate of the index had put it at exactly 50.The latest reading added to evidence that the eurozone has escaped recession in the third quarter. France and Germany saw gross domestic product already expanding in the three months to June but “the continued weakness of Italy, Spain and Ireland are major concerns and make the rebound heavily reliant on the ‘big-two’,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, which produces the purchasing managers’ indices.The European Central Bank remains cautious about the strength of the 16-country region’s economic upswing and is expected later on Thursday to leave its main interest rate unchanged at the record low of 1 per cent.Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, last month described the central bank’s monetary policy stance as “appropriate” – a phrase that has become a codeword signalling that ECB policymakers are in no rush to change interest rates.ECB growth forecasts released later on Thursday are likely to be more upbeat about prospects for the rest of this year than in June, when it last published projections.But Mr Trichet warned last month at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that better economic news “does not mean at all that we do not have a very bumpy road ahead”.The ECB remains concerned that weaknesses in the banking sector could prevent the flow of credit needed to oil the wheels of recovery. Rising unemployment and volatile oil and other commodity prices are also seen as threats to growth.At the same time, eurozone inflation has turned negative and is massively undershooting the ECB’s target of an annual rate “below but close” to 2 per cent. The latest reading showed consumer prices in August were 0.2 per cent lower than a year before, compared with a 0.7 per cent fall reported in July. The less-negative annual rate indicated the eurozone’s brush with below-zero inflation would be short-lived. But June’s ECB forecasts still showed 2010 inflation well below the target rate.Still to be announced is whether the ECB plans to impose a “surcharge” on its next unlimited offer of one-year loans to the banking system. The first such operation, in June, at the main policy interest rate of 1 per cent, saw the ECB pumping in €442bn in 12-monthly liquidity – the largest amount ever in a single ECB operation. But the ECB will think carefully before demanding a higher interest rate because such a move would be seen by financial markets as the start of a monetary policy tightening cycle.Mr Trichet’s comments at his press conference on Thursday afternoon will be scrutinised for any sign that he has become more optimistic about eurozone growth prospects and for clues on when – and how – the ECB might implement an “exit strategy” to unwind the emergency measures it took to combat the worst recession in continental Europe since the second world war.
945;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-09-01T18:56:52Z;UK output and loans data cast shadow;;"Britain’s nascent economic recovery was cast into doubt on Tuesday by data showing that its manufacturing sector stalled unexpectedly in August and that efforts to spur demand through increased lending are having little effect.Figures from the Bank of England show that outstanding loans to companies and individuals declined at a record pace in July, in a worrying sign for the prospects of economic recovery. Moreover, private non-financial corporations – which form the backbone of the nation’s economy – paid down £8.4bn of debt during the month. That represented a 1.7 per cent overall drop in their bank credit and the largest decline since records began in 1997.Households showed no more propensity to spend; net lending to individuals fell by £600m to just over £1,450bn, the first net repayment of consumer loans since records started in 1993. The weak level of lending came as loans secured against property and consumer credit both declined by record amounts.A brighter message emerged from a key measure of the money supply, seen as a gauge of the success of the Bank’s efforts to boost supply through so-called quantitative easing.The underlying M4 money supply, which includes notes, coins and deposits at banks but excludes volatile deposits from within some parts of the financial sector, grew by 0.6 per cent in July, and at an annualised 5.3 per cent pace over the three months to July, data from the Bank showed on Tuesday. That is a faster growth rate than earlier this year.Separately, the closely watched CIPS/Markit survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing, known as the PMI Index, unexpectedly fell in August to 49.7 – below the 50 mark that registers stability. This compares with July’s figure of 50.2 – itself revised down from 50.8 previously.The downbeat message on manufacturing put a damper on what had been one of the sectors that seemed to be clearly emerging from recession. As if to underscore the UK’s plight, similar surveys of manufacturing activity for France, Germany, the US and China all showed clear signs of improvement for the same period.Colin Ellis, economist at Daiwa Securities, pointed to the section of the index that records price movements, which showed average input and output charges declined further, suggesting demand was not strong enough to allow producers to raise prices or even hold them steady.“All told, today’s [Tuesday’s] PMI numbers are a reminder that the economy is nowhere near out of the woods yet,” Mr Ellis said.The manufacturing and lending data follow a survey this week from the Engineering Employers’ Federation concluding that access to credit remains a significant barrier for manufacturers. Economists said one big risk is that the private sector moves to cut debt too quickly in an effort to ride out the recession.While there is no question that households and banks need to reduce their borrowings – in the case of banks this requires them to cut their lending too – this could be destabilising for the economy as a whole. If households and businesses cannot borrow, they cannot spend or invest, leading to a downward spiral in demand and in prices.Indeed, Charles Bean, deputy Bank of England governor, made clear in a speech last week that its efforts to boost money supply through up to £175bn in gilts purchases is aimed at encouraging lending by banks. “De-leveraging by restricting credit growth may be privately rational, but if every intermediary tries to do the same, the result will be lower activity and higher defaults …[What] we might describe as the ‘paradox of de-leveraging’.”However, Vicki Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, noted that if lending to private non-financial corporations is falling, it may be with good reason. Bank of England data show that in the second quarter, write-offs of bad debt to the sector doubled to £1.26bn, a record high and a 51 per cent increase from the level seen in the first three months of this year."
946;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-08-21T21:56:05Z;German economic recovery powers ahead;;The eurozone economy is returning decisively to growth sooner than expected, boosted by Germany’s recovery jumping into a higher gear, according to closely watched surveys.Purchasing managers’ indices for the 16-country region were the strongest since May last year, adding to evidence the recession was over and that policymakers might have underestimated pace of recovery.The latest readings gave “a clear indication that we’re heading for a very strong third quarter, particularly in Germany”, said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank. They were the latest data to surprise on the upside.The severe downturn is being followed by “a historically rapid rebound”, said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, that produces the surveys.Germany and France last week wrong-footed economists by both reporting a 0.3 per cent rise in gross domestic product in the second quarter, compared with the previous three months – marking the technical end of their recessions.Germany’s purchasing managers’ index indicated its recovery had gathered further momentum, jumping from 49 in July to 54.2 in August. A figure of more than 50 indicates an expansion in activity.Growth was driven by the service sector, where employment increased – but manufacturing also showed a further rebound.France’s economy was also now expanding clearly, according to a separate purchasing managers’ index.The eurozone indices plunged sharply after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year, reaching a low point in February. Their v-shaped recovery pointed to a “very quick unwinding of the confidence shock, which could overshoot”, argued Jacques Cailloux, European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. That increased the probability of the permanent damage caused by the recession proving less pervasive than was at first feared.Until this month, the European Central Bank had forecasted a return to quarterly growth only in mid-2010. It remains sceptical about whether the revival is sustainable – but will almost certainly revise upwards its growth forecasts next month.Rising unemployment and a weakened banking sector are expected to act as brakes on growth. Europe’s rebound is also held back by countries facing structural adjustments, including Spain and Italy.The eurozone purchasing managers’ index, covering services and manufacturing, rose to 50 in August, from 47 in July, pointing to a broad stabilisation. But during the crisis the indices underestimated both the extent of the eurozone’s downturn and the pace of the recovery – which could mean the rebound has been stronger than the results suggested.Germany’s recovery has been driven by the country’s “cash-for-bangers” incentives for new car purchases and a pick-up in global demand for its exports .But Axel Weber, Bundesbank president, warned “the economy is not yet standing on its own feet, and the financial markets are still reliant on central bank help”. With Mr Weber among the most prominent members of the ECB’s governing council, his comments suggest the central bank will be in no rush to reverse the steps it took to combat the crisis.
947;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-08-21T09:12:20Z;German economic recovery powers ahead;;Germany’s economic recovery has leapt into a higher gear, according to a closely watched survey that showed private sector activity expanding this month at the fastest rate for 15 months and lifting the overall eurozone economy’s performance.The purchasing managers’ index for Europe’s largest economy jumped to 54.2 in August, from 49.0 in July, signalling an unexpectedly brisk pace of expansion. The growth was driven by the service sector, where employment actually rose, but manufacturing also showed a further rebound.The figures were the latest economic data from continental Europe to surprise on the upside and suggested the region had overtaken the US and UK in the pace of its recovery. France’s economy is also now expanding clearly, according to a separate purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone’s second largest economy.The euro gained 0.5 per cent on the dollar to $1.43 and 0.2 per cent on the pound to £0.86.Germany and France last week wrong-footed economists by both reporting a 0.3 per cent rise in gross domestic product in the second quarter, compared with the previous three months – marking the technical end of their recessions.But continental Europe’s rebound still appears to be being held back by other countries, including Spain and Italy, where GDP continued to fall significantly in the second quarter. The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, covering services and manufacturing, rose to exactly 50 in August, from 47.0 in July.With a 50 marking the boundary between an expansion and contraction in activity, the latest figures point to a broad stabilisation after the worst recession in continental Europe since the second world war. But in recent months, the purchasing managers’ indices appeared to have underestimated the pace of the recovery in France and Germany, which could mean that overall growth was also expanding at the eurozone level during the last three-month period.The latest improvement “positions the eurozone to post growth in GDP in the third quarter”, said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, which produces the survey.Germany’s rebound appears to have been powered by the country’s pioneering “cash-for-clunkers” incentives for new cars purchases and a pick-up in global demand for its exports. Earlier this week, the Bundesbank reported that consumer spending was likely to have risen further in the second quarter and described German shoppers as “remarkable in continuing to defy the negative effects of the global economic and financial crisis”.The Bundesbank argued that a “further marked pick-up in overall economic output is possible in the third quarter”.However, Axel Weber, Bundesbank president, has sought to rein in expectations, warning in a German newspaper interview this week that “the economy is not yet standing on its own feet, and the financial markets are still reliant on central bank help”. Other European Central Bank policymakers have also warned that a self-sustaining recovery may take longer to emerge – which also suggested the ECB will be in no rush to reverse the exceptional steps it took to combat the eurozone’s recession.Mr Dobson at Markit added: “Rising job losses and the continued need for widespread and deep price discounting remain concerns.”

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

949;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Credit less bullish than equities;;"As equity investors ponder whether the recent pullback in equities is just a brief pause for breath in an extended rally, fixed-income markets are signalling a less optimistic view of the economy and the consumer.Until late last week, equities had diverged from the bearish performance of corporate credit and steady decline in Treasury yields. Then, equities were hit by selling, a move which extended the weakness in credit and boosted government bonds further.This split in thinking has long been a feature of trading across asset classes, with equities usually reflecting a more optimistic view of the economy and the consumer. But over the past week, the debate over the sustainability and strength of a recovery in economic activity has intensified.Equities in Japan, Europe and the UK have pulled back after a strong rebound from their lows in March. While data from Japan, France and Germany show that their economies have pulled out of a recession, doubts remain about how quickly activity will
normalise.“There are a number of headwinds in the economy and they are not really going away very quickly or easily,” says Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.Economists expect the US will expand in the third quarter, as low inventories are built back up but recent US data has highlighted weak consumption and tighter credit standards. The latest Federal Reserve loan officers survey for the three months ending July revealed further tightening in lending conditions.“Against a backdrop of high and rising unemployment and declining real incomes, it would be a leap of faith to suggest that this situation is going to change any time soon,” says Capital Economics.That has fuelled a Treasury rally, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note back below 3.50 per cent, down from near 3.90 per cent at the end of the first week of August. “Once you stabilise, the recession ends, but the reality is that we face very weak growth as consumer balance sheets take time to adjust,” says Bill O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities. “We have seen solid inflows into Treasuries since yields recently peaked.”Institutional investors such as Pimco have recently sought to lower their risk to some areas of the credit market, such as high yield, which has rallied more than 30 per cent this year.“High yield has been the winner of the year and it’s time to turn cautious,” says Mark Kiesel, portfolio manager at Pimco.“The second half of the year is going to see choppy waters for credit and that is a function of the economic reality being pretty weak with credit being range bound,” he adds.Since narrowing to 105 basis points earlier this month, the CDX benchmark for investment grade credit default swaps has moved back above 120bp, its highest level since July 22.In Europe, the Markit iTraxx Europe Investment Grade index was on Tuesday about 100bp, out from a recent low of 85bp a week ago. The Markit iTraxx Europe Crossover index was at 633bp, compared with 584bp earlier in the month.Notably, credit, unlike equities, has played down recent corporate earnings which propelled global stock markets to highs for the year.In the US, investors cheered three-quarters of reporting companies beating lowered estimates. Revenue misses and sales declines were overshadowed by expectations that a rebound in economic activity during the third quarter will translate into better earnings for companies that have sharply cut costs.For many companies, however, cost-cutting translates into slashing jobs or wages, and the bleak employment picture, in turn, weighs heavily on consumer spending and confidence.“Consumers in different income groups have their own reasons to keep a lid on spending, be it high unemployment in the low-income segment, the overlevered balance sheets of the middle class, and lost wealth and fears of tax hikes among high earners,” says Oleg Melentyev, credit strategist at Banc of America Securities.Equity investors, however, think the market has been due a period of consolidation and the S&P 500 can reach 1,100 by the end of the year. It is below 1,000, after recently slipping back from a rise of nearly 50 per cent from its lows in March.Other analysts are more bearish. Andrew Lapthorne, at Société Générale, says: “Equities have yet to fully reflect the consequences of declining nominal sales and incomes, which in part was evident in the economic data from the latter part of last week.The bank warns: “In particular, with an absence of corporate cheerleading for the next couple of months, the economic news will likely need to improve somewhat for equities to make much headway during the tricky months of September and October.”"

951;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-08-11T18:16:36Z;Corporate bond windfall for the BoE;Bank returns more than 10% on £918m portfolio;Unintentionally smart market timing has left the Bank of England sitting on a tidy profit from its corporate bond purchases following a strong market rally.Analysis by Evolution Securities calculated that the Bank had made returns of more than 10 per cent on its £918m portfolio of corporate bonds, which it began buying in March as part of its quantitative easing strategy.The Bank announced its plans early that month when the spread, or premium paid by companies over government rates, was near its widest levels. Since then spreads have tightened relative to gilts, pushing corporate prices higher.On Tuesday the Markit iTraxx Crossover index – a widely followed index of sub-investment grade credits – was trading at a spread of 607 basis points, down from 956bp at the end of March. Over the same period the iTraxx Europe index, which references highly rated credits, has fallen from a spread of 175bp to just over 90bp, its lowest level in more than a year.The Bank made almost half its corporate bond purchases in the first few weeks of the plan, when spreads were at their widest. All the bonds it bought are now trading at higher prices than when they were purchased, according to Evolution, and spreads over gilts have narrowed by an average 111bp.“Clearly the Bank did not start doing this to make a quick buck but a by-product is that they have made money. If you were a hedge fund who had done this, you would be proud of your timing,” said Gary Jenkins, strategist at Evolution.Corporate bonds have rallied as investors have been attracted by a combination of the high interest rates on offer plus the relative security of bonds compared with equities. The demand has led to a surge in new issuance, particularly in Europe where companies have traditionally relied more on short-term bank funding, which is in many cases no longer available or too expensive.The gains in prices mean the Bank is benefiting from the high interest rates on the debt it owns and has the potential for capital gains should it choose to sell its holdings.The news comes as markets await the Bank’s quarterly inflation report on Wednesday for a fuller glimpse of its thinking.Last week, it stunned markets when it announced a £50bn increase in its quantitative easing efforts when investors had expected it would instead end the programme.
952;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-08-03T18:32:13Z;Industrial output on the rebound;;Global manufacturing is clearly on the rebound, with survey reports on Monday showing activity contracting at a significantly slower pace in the US and continental Europe, and UK industry back on a growth path.The upbeat results added to evidence that the world’s main economic regions stabilised in July, bringing closer the prospect of growth resuming.“Everyone is benefiting from improvements in all their export markets – so it is magnifying the impact,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces purchasing managers’ surveys for Europe and Asia.However, a return to solid growth was still not certain in many parts of the world, economists warned. Much of the recent improvement reflected companies rebuilding inventories, and was boosted by China’s rebound, argued Marco Annunziata, chief economist at Unicredit. “I’m worried that the world economy doesn’t have the stamina to keep growing.”In the US, the July ISM manufacturing index rose 4.1 points to 48.94. This is the slowest pace of contraction since August 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, although still the 18th consecutive monthly decline. A figure below 50 marks the boundary between expanding and contracting activity.The new orders and production indices – indicative of prospects for future growth – both rose over the month. New orders jumped 6.1 points to 55.34, growing for only the second time since December 2007, while the production index rose 5.4 points to 57.95, growing for the second consecutive month.“Overall, it would be difficult to convince many manufacturers that we are on the brink of recovery, but the data suggest that we will see growth in the third quarter if the trends continue,” said Norbert Ore, ISM chairman.The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index was revised higher to show its second strongest rise since the survey began in 1998. But at 46.3 in July, up from 42.6 in June, the survey still suggested that recovery in the 16-country region was lagging behind that in the US and UK.Germany largely powered the eurozone’s improvement, reporting a record increase in its index and the first rise in new order volumes since June last year. In contrast, Italy’s manufacturing recovery appeared less advanced.But Markit described as “remarkable” the turnround in the UK manufacturing index. The sector “has clearly pulled out of the nosedive it was in earlier this year”, said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchase and Supply, which co-produces the survey.The UK index rose from 47.4 in June to 50.8 in July, rising above the 50 level for the first time since March 2008.Japanese manufacturing is also expanding again, according to data last week, and Chinese manufacturing production rebounded further in July to rise at the fastest rate since May 2008, according to the country’s CLSA purchasing managers’ index. The index rose to 52.8 in July from 51.8 in June, marking the fourth consecutive month of expansion.India’s purchasing managers’ index remained unchanged at 55.30 in July, reflecting an expansion in orders. However, the country’s exports fell for the ninth month in a row in June, strengthening the likelihood of new state assistance for manufacturing sectors blighted by the global economic downturn.Exports fell almost 28 per cent to $12.8bn (€9bn, £7.7bn) in June compared with the previous year, the government said on Monday.Additional reporting by Jamil Anderlini in Beijing, Daniel Pimlott in London and James Lamont in New Delhi
953;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-08-03T10:12:03Z;UK manufacturing output bounces back;;Manufacturing output last month saw the biggest rate of growth since December 2007, in a sign of nascent recovery in the UK economy.Production in the sector jumped sharply as companies running low on stocks were forced to make new orders and restart production lines, according to the manufacturing purchasing managers index. The output index reached a level of 55.1 from 51.8 in June, where any level above 50 is consistent with growth.New orders rose for the first time since March 2008, as the index leapt from 49.8 to 55.9 over the month.The solid gains in new orders and output helped overall business conditions move above the index level of 50, signalling an increase in activity for the first time since March last year.“The manufacturing sector has clearly pulled out of the nosedive it was in earlier this year and is no longer plummeting,” said David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, which compiles the report along with polling company Markit.“The turnround signalled by PMI data during 2009 to date has been remarkable. After hitting record lows around the turn of the year, indexes for output and new orders moved firmly into expansion territory in July,” said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit.The increase in new orders was largely driven by rising business in the UK, while export orders continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace.Markit and Cips said the recoveries in output and new orders were broad-based in terms of company size and sector. But the manufacturing sector has been among the worst hit parts of the economy and has contracted at the fastest pace since the mid-1970s recession. Amid its decline, employment fell for the 15th month in a row in July and companies were still slashing their inventory.But the sharp decline in the industry caused by businesses selling off stock rather than making new orders during the recession, means that as production lines restart and new orders return, the economy should receive a boost.“This rise in new orders highlights that the fall in inventories evident at the height of the crisis is beginning to result in a boost to output as the inventory cycle begins to turn,” said Christian Lawrence, economist at RBC Capital Markets.Preliminary GDP data for the second quarter showed a slowing in the pace of decline in manufacturing. The PMI data implies that the sector has now returned to growth, but official figures were weaker in the second quarter than the PMIs for manufacturing and services had implied, suggesting that the data should be treated with caution.The CBI survey of the sector gives a gloomier picture – with new orders at their lowest level since 1992.
954;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;German data hint at eurozone lift;;Germany’s role in powering the eurozone’s economic recovery was highlighted in closely watched surveys on Friday but the 16-country region’s growth prospects still appeared fragile.The German purchasing managers’ index for July showed the largest one-month gain since the survey began in 1998, while the Munich-based Ifo institute reported its business climate index had also risen strongly. At 87.3, up from 85.9 in June, the Ifo index hit the highest level since last October. “The economy is gaining traction,” said Hans-Werner Sinn, Ifo’s president.The results suggested the end of the recession in Europe’s largest economy was closer than previously thought. Crucially, the rise in the Ifo index reflected a more optimistic assessment by businesses of current conditions, rather than just expectations of an improvement in the next six months. That added to evidence that the recovery was becoming entrenched, and not just based on hope.Meanwhile, the German purchasing managers’ survey showed employment in service industries rose in July – hinting the labour market shake-out would prove less severe than in the UK or US. The German composite index, covering manufacturing and services, rose from 44.0 in June to 48.9 – in striking distance of the 50 level that would mark a return to expanding economic activity.Prior to the latest surveys, hopes had already risen that second-quarter German gross domestic product had barely contracted, after a catastrophic 3.8 per cent fall in the first quarter. Friday’s results added to evidence that the third quarter would mark a clear return to growth.However, unexpectedly weak data from France pointed to vulnerabilities in the European recovery story. French service industries were hit by poor demand and a deteriorating labour market, which led to the country’s purchasing managers’ index dropping from 47.8 in June to 47.2.Eurozone growth prospects remain tempered by the region’s reliance on a pick-up in world growth, especially in export-dependent Germany. Economists believe significant rises in unemployment are in the pipeline across the region, and fear a delayed German credit crunch caused by continuing weakness in the country’s banking system. The strong euro also weighs on growth prospects.The overall eurozone composite purchasing mangers’ index hit a 10-month high of 46.8, up from 44.6 in June. That pointed to a further deceleration in the pace of economic contraction but “the eurozone continues to lag the US and UK, where returns to growth are already evident”, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which produces the survey.Anecdotal evidence in the UK pointed to a stronger feeling that the government was addressing the crisis aggressively, “which is by no means as evident in the eurozone”, Mr Williamson added.Markit estimated that the latest readings were consistent with eurozone GDP contracting at a quarterly rate of about 0.3 per cent. Its surveys pointed to a second-quarter eurozone GDP contraction of about 0.5 per cent. Official second-quarter GDP figures are published in mid-August.
955;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-24T10:14:42Z;UK GDP shrinks at fastest rate for 60 years;;Britain’s economy contracted in the second quarter, marking a full year of decline sharper than any since the 1930s barring that of second world war and its aftermath.Economic output fell by 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the three months to June, after a 2.4 per cent decline in the first quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics’ “flash” first estimate of gross domestic product on Friday.Although the economy is contracting at a much slower pace than earlier this year, the decline was far sharper than the average 0.3 per cent forecast by economists in a Thomson Reuters poll, and worse than even the most gloomy estimate in that survey.The contraction, which is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline in UK output, prompted economists to speculate that the Bank of England may expand its bond buying programme of quantitative easing.“The provisional UK GDP figures for Q2 are shockingly bad and firmly dash any hopes that the UK had already pulled out of recession,” said Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics.The latest official data seemed to cast doubt on the widely followed CIPS/Markit surveys of purchasing managers, which have been decidedly upbeat in recent months, Ms Redwood said.Mike Saunders at Citigroup said that year-on-year the UK has just experienced the sharpest economic contraction in any year since the 1930s except for that seen during world war two and the wind down of the war economy.Colin Ellis, economist at Daiwa Securities, noted that the economy has now shrunk by 5.7 per cent from peak to trough.“Ignoring the spike in GDP in the second quarter of 1979 that distorts the true peak in activity, this is the largest peak-to-trough fall since the current data series started in 1955,” Mr Ellis said.“But the bottom line was that today’s number is pretty dire, and a sharp wake-up call for anyone who had already been dreaming of recovery.”Within broader GDP, the output of production industries declined by 0.7 per cent from their first quarter level, which itself was 5.1 per cent down on the last three months of 2008.Sterling fell by a cent against the dollar and euro following the release of the unexpectedly bad growth data.The weak data prompted economists on Friday to speculate that the Bank’s monetary policy committee would consider at its next meeting in August whether it should expand the quantitative easing programme of security purchases to the full £150bn allocated to it, and may even seek authorisation to expand purchases beyond that level.Economists said that the main surprise in the data was the decline in services output, which fell by 0.6 per cent. The second quarter decline follows a 1.6 per cent drop in services output in the first quarter. Within that sector, business services and finance contributed most to the decline, falling 0.7 per cent, the ONS said.The drop in output in the service sector was underlined by the monthly index of services which was also released by the ONS on Friday. It showed output declined by 0.2 per cent in May compared to the previous month and by 1 per cent and in the three months to May, compared to the three months to April.In the growth figures distribution, hotels and restaurants fell by 0.5 per cent after contracting by 1.5 per cent in the first quarter. Within that, wholesale and motor trades contributed most to the decline.Indeed, the weakness of the motor industry was reflected in new data out Friday morning from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showing that production of cars fell by 30.2 per cent from its year ago level.Production of commercial vehicles – a component of business investment – showed a much sharper contraction, with production down by 60.4 per cent in June.
956;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-23T19:01:23Z;The pricing-clearing link;;The regulatory drive to shine a light on the complex and opaque world of credit derivatives has brought into focus the links between pricing and clearing.Regulators have expressed a clear desire to push credit derivatives on to central clearing houses as a way of bringing transparency to the market in the wake of the financial crisis.But pricing is crucial – particularly in the credit default swaps market, one of the fastest-growing segments of the derivatives universe and an engine for Wall Street profits in the last decade.If you have the right price for a CDS, you can assess the risks properly. If you have the wrong price, there could be a loss once the “real” price comes to light. Importantly, companies that own the best pricing data can sell it.The start last week of an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the credit derivatives market by the US Department of Justice has highlighted these issues. Hence an intensified effort to establish “closing prices” in a CDS market now worth about $26,000bn in outstanding contracts.“In the past 12 months risk managers have really started focusing on the accuracy of end-of-day pricing data,” says Laurent Paulhac, chief executive officer at Credit Markets Analysis. “It is a bit surprising that it took people so long to start challenging the accuracy of pricing data received for risk management or valuation purposes, but the fact that people are looking at this now is good news .”In order for a clearing house to assess the risks it is bearing–- and to charge its members enough margins to cover those risks – it needs to assess the prices of the securities. Many markets that are cleared, from US Treasury futures to interest rate swaps, are based on highly liquid markets where the prices can be easily worked out.But CDS prices, where numerous entities have been seeking to sell accurate prices by either getting feeds from dealers or by scanning trading screens and “scraping” them off, have proved to be inadequate for assessing risks.Changes are afoot to fix this. In the process, providers of this data will end up holding a lot of power and regulators are trying to work out how to mitigate this. For example, a group of global regulators is working on setting out rules about how much data clearing houses for CDS have to make public, for free, and how much they can sell.A number of entities are looking at setting up clearing services for CDS and other over-the-counter derivatives. ICE Trust, a clearing house set up by the Intercontinental Exchange, is backed by big dealers and has made the most progress. CME, the derivatives exchange group, is also developing a clearing house but has yet to get the backing of big dealers. It owns CMA.ICE has introduced a method to make sure it has proper market prices, which, once single credits and indices are included, can span thousands of securities. Specifically, ICE has a system that it operates with Markit where dealers submit prices at the end of the day. Some of these prices are then traded on but dealers do not know which ones will be traded. This ensures that all prices that are submitted are tradeable.“Clearing is very dependent on having good pricing,” says Dirk Pruis, chief executive of ICE. “The process of introducing clearing forces more discipline on pricing. The pricing is needed to clear, and traders have to submit prices at which they are willing to trade.”Mr Pruis says other forms of price collection offered good prices in many cases but not necessarily across the entire range of credits or for different maturities, as more trading is concentrated on the most liquid five-year maturities. For the purposes of assessing risks for a clearing house, prices are needed across all cleared products.Regulators say privately that the move to clearing has made them realise that CDS prices are not always reliable, especially as it is not easy to know whether actual trading has taken place. The clearing houses could, in theory, fix that problem too.Although the CDS market itself functions around a relatively small group of dealers and investors, the prices are often referred to by many other segments of the market as a measure of creditworthiness, from equities to loans. It is this role of CDS prices that has regulators fired up, and is one reason – beyond reducing systemic risks – that regulators want “good” prices to be easily available and for prices to reflect actual trading activity.Markit has a high profile since it receives prices on a range of credit derivatives from dealers and distributes these to the broader market. It also manages the array of indices based on credit, loan, mortgage and asset-backed market risks, all of which have become highly popular with investors.Yet because some of the biggest dealers are also Markit’s shareholders, it and the dealers are being scrutinised by the DoJ.“Valuation is a big part of our business, but we also make our data available to third-party valuation services,” says Kevin Gould, president of Markit North America.“Cleaning” data is not easy, however, especially once a range of maturities are included.“We take data from multiple sources, including 40 banks’ books of record, buy-side institutions and inter-dealer brokers. We then aggregate and clean the data, and in many cases discard up to 60 per cent of it in order to publish a comprehensive, high-quality dataset,” Mr Gould says.
957;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-21T22:11:19Z;UK businesses despondent about recovery;;"More than half of UK businesses do not see any improvement in their prospects for at least another 12 months.While about a quarter expect economic recovery by the third quarter of 2010, a fifth believe they are on course for a cash crisis this year, according to a new survey of board-level managers and financial controllers at large British companies.Low cash reserves and the dearth of credit mean that businesses do not expect to be able to take full advantage of any improved conditions for at least another six months after the upturn begins, meaning it could be 2011 by the time their businesses begin to see the benefit of the upswing.Klaus Kremers, a partner at Roland Berger, the restructuring consultants that compiled the study, said: “When you hear comments nowadays or read the press, people are expecting quite a quick economic turnround, but this survey confirms that this is not the case.”The survey of more than 100 UK companies with annual revenues of more than £250m, found that 22 per cent of respondents were on course for a cash crisis this year with 17 per cent saying they were at risk of insolvency.The proximate cause for their despondency is the lack of liquidity, as bank credit dries up and recession-hit customers delay payments to their suppliers. Almost all of those surveyed experienced an increase in late payments since the recession began and a third reported that their credit lines had been reduced.Mr Kremers said: “This level of businesses experiencing a reduction in credit lines is the same as it was six months ago, so when people say the banking system has recovered because of all the government programmes, it is just not true.“Banks are still not lending enough money like they should.”The liquidity squeeze has led to pressure on banking covenants, with 71 per cent of executives saying pressure has increased on their companies’ interest cover ratios. At the extreme end, 8 per cent of businesses surveyed have already experienced a breach of their banking covenants or are expecting one later this year.
● More than a quarter of FTSE 100 companies cut or suspended their dividend during the first six months of the year, but the trend may have hit bottom, according to new research.The study by Markit found that 12.1 per cent of companies suspended dividends in the first half of the year while 15.5 per cent cut pay-outs, but the measures were projected to fall to 8 and 14.2 per cent over the next six months.Banks and basic resources performed worst, while personal and household goods offered the best levels of returns, Markit said."
958;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors regain appetite for credit risk;;An important barometer of European appetite for risk in the credit market on Tuesday improved to a level not seen since just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year.The Markit iTraxx Europe, the continent’s main credit default swap index, which tracks the 125 most liquid names in the investment-grade class, fell below the 100 basis points mark for the first time since September 2008. It closed at 97.37bp.CDS are over-the-counter derivatives that offer insurance against the non-payment of unsecured debt, usually corporate or sovereign bonds. The cost of cover is measured in basis points, each point being equivalent to €1,000 payable annually on €10m of debt.The recent tightening of CDS indices comes on the back of a strong rally in European equities, which have risen for seven consecutive sessions.Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution, said: “It’s a reflection of the fact that credit remains the asset class of choice. Companies are focused on cash flow generation, debt reduction and improving balance sheet strength, which is close to being the perfect backdrop for credit.”In spite of some fears that uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook will continue to pose challenges for credit, the market is likely to take heart from the an upsurge in companies raising money via a spate of bond and rights issues. Following the implosion of Lehman, the cost of insuring against the risk of default on European corporate debt shot up by almost 20 per cent in two days and continued rising until it peaked at 215bp last December.“Lehman created the prospect of total collapse of the financial system, which was priced in after it fell, but the market is now saying ‘we are no longer looking for this complete meltdown’. Governments have done enough to prevent that,” said Willem Sels, head of credit strategy at Dresdner Kleinwort.Some analysts worry that the index is close to being over-priced.

960;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-18T17:45:20Z;Morgan Stanley says clearing revenues to be lower;;Clearing revenues are unlikely to be as significant as many expect for the world’s biggest exchanges, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, who put annual revenues from such post-trade business at $200m-$400m.Clearing has come into sharp focus amid a “re-regulatory” agenda emerging in Washington and Brussels as part of the clean-up of global market infrastructure.Regulators have called for as many bilaterally negotiated, or over-the-counter, derivatives as possible to be processed through clearing houses, which step in when one party defaults to ensure a trade is completed.That has led many to believe that exchanges with clearing houses, as well as independent clearers, stand to benefit handsomely.However Morgan Stanley said: “Revenue opportunity for clearing is smaller than many think.”Its analysts, led by Bruce Hamilton, said that while the shift to clearing should benefit ICE - or the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange – as well as LCH.Clearnet and “plausibly” Deutsche Börse and CME Group, “our view is that it is likely to be helpful rather than transformational”.The bank estimated that clearing equated to “perhaps 2-5 per cent profit enhancement” for Deutsche Börse.Morgan Stanley also said that those OTC derivatives clearing initiatives most likely to succeed would be those where exchanges and inter-dealer brokers (IDBs) worked co-operatively with dealer-banks already involved in the business.“Winning strategies for exchanges and IDBs are consortia: sharing economics with dealer banks will be critical to success,” the analysts said.Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing unit is trying to build a joint venture credit default swaps clearing business with some of the banks involved in the CDS business. It has offered them a 90 per cent stake.ICE already operates a CDS clearer, ICE Trust, also a joint venture with some of the same banks.“While this improves chances of success, it also lowers the profit outcome for the successful platform,” Morgan Stanley said.The bank said electronic trading of CDS and [interest] rates derivatives – also a key aim of regulators – would likely be “evolutionary not revolutionary”.“A key risk to our evolutionary view is whether regulators impose dislocation – whether insisting on rapid exchange trading, which could affect liquidity and riskiness of trading, or regulatory moves such as investigations of market structure, which would dislocate banks’ ability to earn a return on their risk capital,” Morgan Stanley said.Last week, it emerged that the US Department of Justice had started investigating Markit, a data provider, and dealers in the credit derivatives market for potential violations of the US Sherman Act, which prohibits abuses of monopoly power or other forms of collusion.Separately, consultancy Tabb Group said most CDS would “never” be cleared in the US or Europe due to technical difficulties like daily risk management, and because CDS agreements can be outstanding for years and need to be risk-managed daily.“CDS clearing is more about managing risk, margin and workflow than transferring securities title and facilitating payment,” said Larry Tabb, founder and chief executive. “The clearing of CDS is not all homogenous and has different complexity levels. Index-based CDS clearing is much more straightforward than clearing single-name CDS or CDS tranche products. We believe the most significant CDS clearing challenges come from five major issues: product complexity, valuation, liquidity, interoperability and counterparty-risk.”The consultancy added that the global nature of CDS markets was another hurdle.“Most clearinghouses are local, as members, products and regulators typically are regulated nationally,” Tabb Group said. “For clearing of OTC products to succeed, all of the participants must adopt standard contract language, structure, trade matching, affirmation and communication timeframes. But one of the primary challenges for effective global OTC trade clearance is the lack of consistent access to clearing corporations by potential participants, because scale and critical mass maximise the value of clearing.”
961;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;DoJ’s antitrust missile could have explosive consequences;;The Department of Justice’s antitrust investigation into how dealers provide credit derivatives prices to a custodian of pricing power and information, which they happen to own, opens a new front in the tussle between regulators and Wall Street.In a week when Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan released turbo-charged trading results for the second quarter (which amply illustrate how the decline of some rival dealers has reinforced their dominance), the DoJ’s move suggests that the future for such institutions may not be so rosy.The DoJ says its “antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries”.This involves looking at Markit, a vendor that passes on derivatives pricing data to a variety of investors and institutions. Markit is owned by more than a dozen leading dealers and in essence acts as a wall between the broader market and the inner sanctum of prices provided by traders.Lawyers contend that the DoJ suspects that some dealers may have been behaving as a cartel when it comes to supplying prices and selecting the composition of the various indices that are published and managed by Markit.There is a long history of trust-busting in the US, but some of the big banks privately disparage the DoJ as being on nothing more than a fishing expedition. Under a new and proactive administration, the DoJ is angling in earnest.Although there are other providers of credit derivatives data, Markit is pre-eminent because of the backing of the dealers. The vendor provides prices at times during the day to clients, but much of the information it releases is done with a one-day lag.This type of arrangement is the bedrock of the over-the-counter derivatives market. For the big dealers, information is power and that means keeping smaller banks and investors such as hedge funds and money managers at arm’s length.Unlike an equity price for a company, if you type credit derivatives on a Bloomberg terminal, there is no live trading price, let alone volume data for a specific credit or index. The “live” market can be ascertained only by talking directly with or e-mailing one of the big dealers.In the sequestered world of OTC derivatives, only leading dealers, large investors and interdealer brokers have an idea of what actually trades. The cost of credit protection can jump 500 basis points in the blink of an eye because dealers making two-way prices simply raise their selling prices in order not to trade. All that smoke and no actual trading fire, however, sends equity investors running for the exit because they think the company may be going under.The banks argue that because they provide the prices, it is their market. But setting the rules becomes moot when credit derivatives have sparked a global financial train wreck, with once-heavy players in those products, such as AIG, now backed by the US taxpayer.We are at a point where credit derivatives must become fully transparent so general investors can track credit protection premiums just like a stock price.Keeping credit default swap prices, let alone actual trading volumes, under wraps is harder to justify in the post-financial crisis world, where the power of the surviving dealers has become far more entrenched.As the worst of the financial crisis fades, we are left with a world of even bigger banks. That only raises the stakes for regulators and taxpayers, should one of the leviathan banks become stranded amid the shoals of risk.Under this new regime, and in spite of the banks’ lobbying against sweeping changes, regulators will regret any failure to clamp down hard on OTC derivatives and structured finance.Against that backdrop, the antitrust missile launched by the DoJ could well have explosive consequences for dealers, who are making handsome profits and believe any tough restrictions on derivatives trading will not be passed by their friends in Congress.

The Department of Justice this week confirmed that it had started an investigation into pricing practices in the credit derivatives markets.

As the DoJ peers into this once-geeky world, it is not surprising if it thinks some of those practices look a touch odd – at least given the mood of the times.The essential problem is that growth in these markets has been so frenetic in recent years that activity has outgrown the infrastructure, in a logistical, political and social sense.Take the case of pricing.

964;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-15T18:32:35Z;CDS probe opens new ‘can of worms’;;The future shape of the credit derivatives market was already difficult to sketch out. With regulators and market participants immersed in a tussle over how much of it needs to be centrally cleared in order to reduce risks to the financial system, much debate has ensued about what form this market will take.Now, a new set of questions is making the rounds as the US Department of Justice investigates the $26,000bn credit derivatives market’s main data provider, Markit, and the dealers that control it for potential anticompetitive behaviour.“It is opening another can of worms,” said Joel Telpner, partner at Mayer Brown. “Many of the initiatives so far, such as the move towards centralised clearing, would not change anything in terms of how contracts are priced.” He said it was unclear where the DoJ’s probe would lead – and whether it would change the structure of the market, which is dominated by a handful of large Wall Street firms – but it could have a significant impact.While the DoJ’s antitrust division has traditionally kept a close eye on financial markets, it has taken few enforcement actions in the last eight years when the Bush administration took a more hands-off attitude to competition.The probe into the unregulated CDS market shows a new aggressiveness at the DoJ when it comes to antitrust – or anticompetitive – matters. Under the Sherman Act, which prohibits abuses of monopoly power, it has requested huge amounts of pricing and trading activity information going back several years.“This is a sea-change from the past eight years,’’ said Harvey Goldschmid, a law professor at Columbia University and a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “The present antitrust division leadership is very different and far more concerned about traditional antitrust values than the group that led the division during the last eight years. This is a group that takes antitrust seriously and the need for competitive markets seriously.’’Christine Varney, newly appointed assistant attorney-general in charge of antitrust policy, has indicated a desire to return to an active interpretation of the 1890 Sherman Act.Credit derivatives in the past decade became one of Wall Street’s most profitable segments, with a small group of banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley involved.“Lack of transparency can lead to the appearance of smoke and, in the current political climate, a hint of smoke leads to the assumption of fire,” said Tim Backshall, chief strategist at Credit Derivatives Research. Banks that have received DoJ requests are trying to assess just how much information they need to collect. It is likely to be an arduous task.Richard Epstein, law professor at the University of Chicago, said: “This is a big investigation which necessarily gives DoJ officials lots of discretion.”
965;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-15T11:06:24Z;DoJ demands CDS trading data from dealers;;The US Department of Justice has started investigating a data provider and dealers in the credit derivatives market for potential violations of the US Sherman Act, which prohibits abuses of monopoly power or other forms of collusion.Demands were sent to more than a dozen dealers for several years’ of detailed information about trading and pricing, according to people who received the letter. The DoJ letter was sent to banks with an equity stake in Markit Group, which provides pricing data on markets including the credit default swaps (CDS).The move comes as the regulatory spotlight shines on the CDS market and other privately traded derivatives markets, parts of which grew dramatically in the last decade and generated huge profits for Wall Street.Markit, which has also been asked for information, has developed many of the most closely watched derivatives pricing benchmarks for CDS such as the mortgage sector’s ABX and the corporate credit CDX and iTraxx Europe indices.According to people who have seen the letter from the DoJ’s antitrust division, the requests are made under sections one and two of the Sherman Act. The DoJ declined to comment.Markit said that it “has been informed of an investigation by the Department of Justice into the credit derivatives and related markets. We will work with the Department to provide any information requested.”Shareholders in Markit include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, among others. Banks either declined to comment or were not available for comment.The DoJ started looking into Markit last year when it sought approval for a joint venture with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp that would combine their respective front and back office operations for processing and confirming derivative transactions. The new company is awaiting regulatory approval.Questions about the way the CDS market works and how information is made available, and at what prices, come as regulators press for efforts to lessen the dominant position held by dealers in many privately traded markets.
966;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-14T21:33:08Z;US probe just what the CDS sector do not need;;As news of the US Department of Justice probe into the credit derivatives world broke on Tuesday, some bankers might have felt it was a development they needed like a hole in the head.Just two years ago, the credit derivatives sector was riding sky high, producing fat profits for banks and expanding at such breakneck speed that more than $60,000bn of contracts were outstanding in the markets, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.But in the past year, the sector has come under political attack, as regulators and politicians have blamed the use of credit derivatives for exacerbating the crisis at institutions such as AIG. And as financial markets have gyrated, the prices of credit default swaps contracts have become so dislocated from the cash bond world that bankers and issuers are increasingly questioning whether the market can be trusted as a pricing benchmark or hedging tool.The two trends are conspiring to leave some bankers – and investors – asking whether the market can continue to thrive in the new regulatory climate. “Frankly, the future of the industry is just not clear,” says one long-standing figure in the CDS market.Unsurprisingly, groups such as ISDA vehemently reject any suggestion that the heyday of CDS might be over. Though the outstanding volume of contracts has declined in the past 18 months (see chart) that is largely because the industry has been “tearing up” (or cancelling) redundant deals as part of a drive to make the sector more streamlined.On the ground, bankers insist investors are continuing to cut new CDS deals at a heady pace, since the product continues to provide a useful function by allowing banks and other investors to hedge against the risk of default on bank loans and bonds. Moreover, the CDS market has been relatively liquid during the past two years of crisis – in sharp contrast to the world of corporate bonds, where activity in effect froze up.Nevertheless, many parts of the CDS sphere have been operating in murky conditions in recent years – precisely because the market has grown at such breakneck speed, in the over-the-counter sphere (where trading is conducted in private deals between banks, rather than on an exchange).That has made it hard for regulators to track risk exposures at groups such as AIG. It has also sparked allegations that banks can sometimes use their dominance of the market to sell inappropriate products to clients or manipulate markets.In recent weeks, for example, rumours have circulated that last year some large dealers manipulated the price of derivatives linked to mortgages and corporate bonds – by “leaning on” prices, to use trading jargon – to hurt rival banks or hedge fund groups.“Some of the stuff that has been happening on the trading desks has been pretty dirty,” says one banker who used to hold a senior position at a large dealer.There is little evidence that those tales are grounded in truth, or directly linked to the current probe by the DoJ. On Tuesday the DoJ refused to elaborate.However, they are believed to have been partly sparked by the DoJ looking at a forthcoming merger between Markit, the data provider, and the DTCC in the US. This has alerted the DoJ to the crucial role played by the dealers, many of whom are shareholders in Markit, in providing prices on credit derivatives.Markit said that it had been informed of an investigation “into the credit derivatives and related markets” and added that “Markit strives to enhance the transparency and efficiency in the credit derivatives market by making all our independent data products commercially available to all market participants”.However, the move by the DoJ undeniably casts a spotlight on pricing patterns and behaviour in the OTC sphere – and the timing is potentially significant.“Markit(’s) levels are sometimes off-market, other data vendors have shown this to be true,” said Tim Backshall, chief credit strategist at Credit Derivatives Research. Markit provides the key source of prices for the industry, and those prices are calculated as an average based on quotes which are submitted to Markit by the banks themselves.However, the prices that Markit calculates are not always the same as those used by banks in their internal models – or used to calculate the level of margin that prime brokers impose on hedge fund clients.Because Markit is backed by the major dealers, it is hard for any one else to challenge their prices. No one can tell, for example, whether the ABX price that is calculated by Markit is correct or not, based on any other independent data. This proved to be critically important during the past two years, when small swings in the ABX proved to be critical in terms of valuing the assets held by hedge funds.In recent weeks, both the European Commission and the US Treasury have launched separate initiatives to impose reforms on the CDS world.The broad aim of the reforms is to make the sector more transparent and robust by forcing activity on to clearing platforms.The banking industry is lobbying stridently against the mandatory use of exchanges, since that could slash margins. But if the DoJ investigation does find any wrongdoing, it could shake confidence in the OTC CDS world – and potentially strengthen the hand of those pushing for activity to move to exchanges, where prices are more transparent.“This [whole issue] is going to get more attention in the coming months,” says Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance.“Wall Street claimed that this was done with sophisticated investors but in the wake of AIG, the taxpayer is now involved and the whole ball game [with regulators] has changed,” Ms Tavakoli added.
967;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-13T19:38:58Z;Spending cuts on search ads to rise;;Cuts in spending on search engine advertising are accelerating even as the rate of decline in overall marketing outlay slows, according to a report by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising.The IPA’s Bellwether report for the second quarter of this year found that the scale of cuts in UK marketing budgets had eased for the second consecutive three-month period. But the survey of marketing executives, released on Monday, showed that budgets were still being severely cut, with marketing spending expected to hit a 15-year low in 2009.Search advertising – in which Google is overwhelmingly the market leader – has hitherto held up better than any other part of the marketing mix.But in aggregate, marketing professionals are cutting search spending by about 5 per cent, the IPA says, making this the only category to see an increased rate of decline.However, the scale of that cut is still much smaller than the fall across the market as a whole in the period, with budgets dedicated to traditional media – such as television and print – cut by about 18 per cent.Overall, just 10 per cent of the companies surveyed said they were increasing investment in marketing this year, compared with 38 per cent who cut budgets in the last quarter.The Bellwether, compiled by Markit, the research company, said advertising revenues for media companies would fall at a slower rate in the second half of 2009.“The new report suggests that the worst is over,” said Rory Sutherland, the IPA’s president and vice-chairman of Ogilvy UK, the advertising agency.“Budget cutting for all marketing communications categories seems to be slowing and, while the economy is still tough, the balance of executives reporting improved prospects moved into positive territory for the first time since Q1 2008,” he added.The IPA’s report follows a global survey by Zenith-Optimedia, the media agency, last month suggesting that the advertising revenues would bottom out in the third quarter of this year. The Advertising Association forecasts UK marketing spending to fall 13.3 per cent during 2009, with no upturn next year.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit and the Bellwether report’s author, said search spending was being trimmed because other marketing budgets had already been cut so much.“What was previously left untouched because it was seen as the most effective way to spend money, now even that is coming under pressure,” he said.Even though advertising budgets were slashed most radically in the fourth quarter of last year, Mr Williamson said he was surprised that they were still falling.“Even though [economic] confidence is increasing, [marketers] are still not lifting their budgets,” he said.One in three companies surveyed said financial prospects had improved in the second quarter, compared with one in four reporting a deterioration.Given that sentiment improvement, Mr Williamson said: “I would have expected to see better data on the marketing budget revisions, which suggests companies remain very, very cautious about the outlook and may be constrained by the availability of finance.”However, investment in marketing can only be cut so far before it starts to damage a company’s brand, he said, which should mean a “very modest” uptick in spending later this year.

The slightly lower reading, while still suggesting business activity increased, comes after much larger rises in the previous three months, underlining fears that the recovery will be sluggish.Optimism in the service sector rose to its highest since the run on Northern Rock heralded the spread of the credit crisis from the markets to the high street. However, new business fell more swiftly than in May and more jobs were cut. “Any recovery is going to be gradual and subdued,” Mr Williamson said.The average reading for the PMIs since they began in 1996 is 55.2.The suggestion of stalling growth in services also comes after the largest six-month rise in the index’s history as the decline of the economy eased rapidly.“Given the substantial gains recorded by the services PMI survey – up by 11.4 points over the past six months, way ahead of its euro area and US equivalents – the marginal pull back in June is hardly a cause for alarm,” said Ross Walker, economist at RBS.

970;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-07-02T12:11:31Z;Tentative building recovery grinds to a halt;;Britain’s hard-pressed construction sector still faces significant headwinds despite showing some signs of improvement earlier this spring, according to official data and a closely-watched survey released on Thursday morning.The CIPS/Markit UK Construction PMI index of total activity slipped back in June, erasing some of the improvement seen in May, with particularly marked unwinding of activity in the housing and commercial construction sectors. Similarly, the Office for National Statistics reported that new orders in the three months to May 2009 fell by 1.0 per cent compared with the previous three month period and between April and May alone, total activity declined by roughly 7.5 per cent.The latest construction data come after the industry showed signs of revival in late spring after a particularly painful first quarter. In releasing revised gross domestic product data for the first quarter of this year, the ONS reported a 2.4 per cent contraction across the economy instead of the 1.9 per cent initially reported, with most of the change accounted for by a much sharper than expected decline in output from the construction industry,The PMI survey, which covers a more recent period, found that despite the slippage overall, expectations of future activity are even more upbeat than they were in May, with a balance of 73.4 per cent of respondents saying they see further improvement. “This was due to greater confidence in the economic recovery,” Markit said. A balance of 50 or higher means that activity is rising and below that, it is falling.Another bright spot was civil engineering orders, which, while still showing falling activity, were less negative than in May. Meanwhile, slack demand is benefiting contractors who report improvement in the availability and quality of subcontractors, and further gains in delivery times.But more ominously, employment activity slipped back, recording a reading of 37.5, down from 38.8 in May but somewhat better than the 33.6 recording in April of this year. “Anecdotal evidence suggested that UK constructors were receiving fewer orders as their clients tighten their spending budgets,” Markit said.Meanwhile, according to the ONS, private housing orders in the three months to May 2009 rose by 11 per cent compared with the previous three months, but between April and May alone, fell by almost 12 per cent. Private housing orders in the year to May fell by 50 per cent compared with the previous year.Private and public infrastructure orders fell in the three months to May by 13 per cent compared with the previous three months, but were up 50 per cent when compared with the same period a year earlier.
971;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-06-29T21:46:46Z;Overview: Doughty investors dip their toes in the water;;US and European equities on Monday recouped some of their losses, although market activity was light ahead of a string of important data releases and a holiday weekend in the US.Commodity prices, credit spreads and emerging market currencies also benefited from the modest improvement in risk appetite, while government bonds trimmed early gains.Valentin Marinov, strategist at Commerzbank, said that for many asset classes, levels of risk largely reflected uncertainty related to the unfolding global recession.“This underpins our view that fundamental data should play an even greater role as a driver of risk appetite,” he said.However, Mr Marinov suggested that this week’s data, including crucial US manufacturing activity and employment reports, might have only a limited impact.“All in all, we doubt that investors’ appetite for risk will receive a major boost, so that the EM and the commodity currencies may find it difficult to leave their recent trading ranges in the very near term,” he said.Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital, said there were several reasons for expecting the recent economic “growth scare” to continue.“On balance, consumption data have been soft, housing demand is improving (but not enough to offset the inventory overhang), the turn in the labour market is uneven and the sector likely to show the most momentum, manufacturing, is in a lull between the end of inventory liquidation and the production ramp up.“So, while we continue to believe the recession ended in May, we may have to wait until later in the third quarter of this year before the macro indicators begin providing positive surprises once again, thereby driving stock prices higher.”But for Monday at least, US and European equities were back in demand.In New York, the S&P 500 closed 0.9 per cent higher, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index advanced 1.8 per cent.In Asia, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 1 per cent but the Shanghai Composite rose 1.6 per cent to a fourth successive one-year high.Credit spreads also rallied, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits tightening 21 basis points to 725bp basis points. The Markit CDX North America index was 4bp tighter at 135.75bp.Commodity prices moved broadly higher, with oil climbing back above $71 a barrel even as the International Energy Agency slashed its forecast for medium-term demand.Emerging market and commodity currencies gained ground against the dollar, notably the South African rand and New Zealand dollar.The US dollar was little changed against the euro, with the single currency finding some support from a third successive improvement in the European Commission’s sentiment index.Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said the data added to evidence that the eurozone recession had shifted into lower gear.But “with economic sentiment remaining firmly in contraction territory, a sustained return to positive growth remains a distant prospect in the eurozone”.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, said that while the list of signs of eurozone economic stabilisation continued to grow, it was still too short to lead the European Central Bank to alter its cautious tone at this week’s policy meeting.“The ECB’s own macro-economic outlook would justify additional easing, but the turnround in activity data has shifted the balance of risks,” Mr Annunziata said.“Given the still high uncertainty, the ECB now probably sees the risks of policy overshoot as larger than those of a renewed economic downturn.”The dollar edged higher against the yen after China ruled out sudden changes to its foreign exchange reserve policy.US government bonds yields continued to decline as a lack of new issuance allowed investors to focus on the Federal Reserve’s debt purchase programme.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell as low as 3.45 per cent, having traded above 4 per cent just over a fortnight ago. In late trade, the yield was down 2bp at 3.48 per cent.In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 3bp lower at 3.36 per cent.

These will run alongside CDS for individual countries, which are already traded.Niall Cameron, global head of indices at Markit, said: “Since the onset of the credit crisis we have seen a dramatic increase in demand to track sovereign credit, as evidenced by the heavy volumes of sovereign CDS being traded.“This should come as no surprise given the rapid deterioration in public finances generally.”Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution, said: “Any product that assists investors with price discovery and relative value is useful.”The two indices Markit expects will attract the most liquidity are the iTraxx SovX Western Europe index, which will track the CDS of 15 countries in western Europe – including the UK, Germany and France – and the Markit iTraxx CEEMEA index, which will track the credit risk of 15 countries in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Two other indices will track the CDS of the group of seven leading industrialised nations, and the CDS of countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and North America. Sovereign CDS, which price the default risk of individual countries, were not widely used by investors until the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September.However, with governments around the world taking on increasing levels of debt to reverse the downturn and pay for bank bail-outs, these CDS have become a more important tool for investors as a way of speculating on or hedging sovereign credit risk.Markit expects the sovereign indices will be used by traditional CDS investors, but they also think traders of government bonds are likely to enter the market.Debt managers, responsible for issuing government bonds, say sovereign CDS indices could help gauge a country’s credit risk.However, some government bond analysts said that an index of countries, which may have very different risk profiles and debt levels, may prove less useful than buying individual sovereign CDS.
973;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-06-17T18:13:19Z;Overview: Caution and risk aversion hover over equities;;The backdrop for global equities was eroded further on Wednesday as bearish signals from technical indicators highlighted growing caution about the economic outlook and increasing risk aversion.The nervous mood was heightened as Standard & Poors’ lowered its credit ratings on a number of US banks and the Obama administration unveiled plans to overhaul financial regulation.The benchmark S&P 500 index in the US briefly dropped below its 200-day moving average of 906, before recovering slightly. Technical analysts believe that a sustained breach of this level would point to further selling.“It’s a big deal in the equity market and people are closely watching the moving average,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading.Another bearish sign was the Vix volatility index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge - closing above 30 for a third successive session.“The Vix index has broken through a downwardly sloping trendline, suggesting that the re-rating of risk has the potential to become more severe,” said Divyang Shah, of IFR Markets. “In New York, the S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to close at 910.71. That came after the FTSE 100 in London fell 1.2 per cent to 4,278.5 – below its 200-day average. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.9 per cent to settle below its 200-day average. Meanwhile, Tokyo bucked a broadly weak trend in Asian markets to finish 0.9 per cent higher. Credit spreads widened in both Europe and the US, reflecting investors risk aversion and the uncertain tone in equities. The Markit iTraxx Crossover index rose 17 basis points to 747bp. John Higgins at Capital Economics said that equity markets were banking on benign inflation – a scenario borne out by a tame set of US consumer price figures yesterday.“We think the S&P could temporarily climb above 1,000 this summer because the equity risk premium has plenty of room to decline and real government bond yields are likely to remain firmly anchored,” he said.“Looking further ahead, though, we think that disappointment at the strength of the recovery will see risk appetite wane towards the end of this year, driving the equity market lower again.”US government bonds initially received a strong boost from the benign inflation data – which showed headline consumer prices rising just 0.1 per cent last month, even as gasoline prices rose 3.1 per cent.“Critics of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive unconventional response to the financial crisis got little support from [yesterday’s] inflation report,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia. “There is no evidence that inflation is a current problem or is about to become one.”After an early decline, the yield on the, inflation sensitive 10-year Treasury was unchanged late in the day at 3.68 per cent, while the two-year yield shed 5bp to 1.16 per cent. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield fell below 3.5 per cent for the first time in a month as it dipped 4bp to 3.48 per cent. UK gilts outperformed, with the 10-year yield sliding 11bp to 3.78 per cent, reflecting relief about Tuesday’s successful syndicated sale of 25-year paper.The muted US inflation figures also added weight to the view that any Fed interest rate rise was still some way away.That was reflected on the currency markets by the dollar’s modest decline against its main rivals. Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets said: “Since global equities peaked out last week, there emerged a higher correlation between stocks, oil and currencies, as reduced risk appetite fed into the lower yielding dollar and yen away from the higher-yielding and/or risk currencies.”He suggested that markets were increasingly looking to the oil price as a “dirty” gauge of risk appetite momentum.Commodities prices rebounded and after oil briefly dropped below the $70 a barrel mark, with weekly inventories data showing an increase in US stockpiles, it recovered to close above $71 a barrel.Doubts about demand also kept the copper price below $5,000 a tonne, while gold edged higher in the wake of the US inflation figures.
974;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-06-03T02:49:52Z;Housebuilders see grounds for optimism;;Optimism at the outlook for the construction market has returned to its highest level since the start of the credit crunch in August 2007, according to a survey of purchasing managers. Actual orders by housebuilders have come within a whisker of growth, having been in unremitting decline since November 2007.Tuesday’s Cips/Markit survey adds to other positive recent indicators for the construction sector, in particular a slowdown in the decline of the main house price indices.However, the purchasing managers’ index, in which any figure below 50 indicates a contraction, still remains at the historically low level of 45.9. Until the downturn hit in March 2008 the index had not contracted since January 1999.Roy Ayliffe, director at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, said: “After appearing to be in freefall in February, we are starting to see the construction economy show some signs of life and steer itself back on to the road of recovery [but] it’s still some way from making a full return to health.”Paul Smith, an economist at Markit, said the results were a “positive step in the right direction” but cautioned that a sustained recovery could prove elusive. “The falls in output at the end of last year were just so severe that in some respects it’s probably not that unexpected to see some sort of return towards normality,” he said. “The question is whether there is anything firm on the demand side to back it up going forward. I’m not overly convinced that there is.”The housebuilding index, which averaged 31.4 throughout last year and dropped as low as 18.7 last July, grew to 48.5 in May.Mr Smith said the causes of this demand growth were unclear, although housebuilders have reported a return to new construction as finished and part-completed stock has run out.Barratt reported last month that stock levels were down to 771 homes compared with 1,821 last June, and several housebuilders have said that on average they have only 1.5 finished homes on each development site. At the time of Barratt’s report, Mark Clare, its chief executive, said: “We’re increasing build rates but only because we’ve run out of stock, people will see more activity on sites across the sector because the stock levels are down and levels of sales have settled.”The new orders index also returned close to positive territory, scoring 48.3. Until March 2008, the index had recorded only one month of contraction since the survey began in 1998.However, Jonathan Hook, a construction partner at PwC, the professional services firm, warned signs of oversupply would choke off any recovery. “There is a real dip in current opportunities for contractors to bid for, and that will feed into confidence, turnover and profits in 2010 and beyond,” he said. “The reduced amount of work available is being bid for at increasingly competitive rates.”
975;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-06-01T14:07:23Z;Land Registry says house price falls easing;;House prices in England and Wales fell in April, but the drop was the smallest of any month over the past year, according to the latest data from the UK Land Registry.The Index eased by 0.3 per cent in April, with house prices in London showing an average 1.4 per cent rise, the highest anywhere in the UK. The average house price in England and Wales is now £152,898, down from £182,557 a year earlier, a drop of 16.2 per cent.The overall picture of a stabilising housing market is in line with the latest house price data from Nationwide which showed a bounce of 1.2 per cent in May, the single highest one-month improvement since late 2006 and the second average rise in the most recent three month period.“The Land Registry data add to mounting evidence that the decline in house prices is moderating appreciably,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. “But we remain highly sceptical that house prices have bottomed out. Significantly, it is not uncommon for there to be months of rising prices when house prices are still trending down.,” he added.Indeed, in releasing its Index last week, Nationwide warned that house prices often move erratically up or down rather than show steady month-on-month movements in a single direction.A moderation in the rate at which house prices are falling, even in the absence of evidence of a rebound, would be consistent with an overall impression of growing economic stability. Earlier today, the Markit/CIPS survey of purchasing managers for the manufacturing sector for May rose to its highest level for a year, while other data have also shown improvement.And while several firms of estate agents interpreted the latest data as a sign that house prices have stopped falling, economists struck a more cautious note.“Land Registry data suggest that the pace of the housing market correction may be easing. In our view, however, with a sustained recovery in the economy a long way off, mortgage credit conditions still tight, and unemployment rising sharply, growing hopes that house prices may be finding a floor seem premature,” said Seema Shah, property economist at Capital Economics.
976;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
977;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-05-19T21:35:34Z;Overview: US fear gauge signals signs of improvement;;Risky assets such as equities and commodities made fresh progress on Tuesday amid further signs of improvement in financial and economic conditions, although concerns remained that recent gains might have been overdone.The Vix volatility index – also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – finally dropped below the 30 level for the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September, suggesting that investors feel less need to insure their equity portfolios using options.In the money markets, interbank lending rates continued to plumb record lows and the spread between three-month dollar Libor and Overnight Index Swap rates – a closely watched measure of credit risk – hit its tightest since March last year.Meanwhile, credit indices showed costs of protecting corporate bonds against default declining, helped by news that leading US banks were rushing to repay government funds.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mainly junk-rated credits fell 27 basis points to 763bp, the lowest in more than a week,Yet US equities drifted in and out of positive territory after the latest US housing data injected a note of caution into the markets. Late in New York, the S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent.European investors were more sanguine, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 1.4 per cent to its highest close since January.Several Asian markets, including Hong Kong and Seoul, climbed to fresh seven-month highs and the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose 2.8 per cent.US housing starts dropped 12.8 per cent to an all-time low in April, although analysts pointed out that the decline had been driven by the volatile multi-family sector.“Taking the key one-family homes starts, evidence is even starting to build that the slump in residential construction is drawing to an end,” said Dimitry Fleming, economist at ING. “In the view of homebuilders, enough has been done to address the supply overhang.”Better news also came from Germany, where the Zew economic institute’s economic expectations index rose for a seventh successive month in May to hit its highest level in nearly three years.“The sharp increase shows that there now are widespread expectations among financial analysts that the German and European economy will rebound within six months,” said Frank Øland Hansen, senior economist at Danske Bank.“We adjust our expectations for tomorrow’s [eurozone] purchasing managers’ indices upward and look for another positive surprise relative to market consensus.”Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at UniCredit, said that the improvement in leading indicators, supported by a better quarterly reporting season than many had feared, had been largely behind the rise in European equities over the past couple of months.“In the coming months, equity investors will probably subject the macro environment to a ‘reality check’, and, after losing momentum, the equity market will ultimately take a breather.”But he added: “We expect on balance a friendly trend on the equity markets into the summer months. Interim setbacks remain limited.”The firm tone in European equities and the encouraging Zew data undermined sentiment towards government bonds in the region.The 10-year Bund yield rose 6bp to 3.43 per cent, the highest for a week, while the 30-year yield rose as high as 4.3 per cent, the highest since November, before easing back slightly.In the US, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3bp to 3.25 per centOn the currency markets, the dollar and the yen both retreated as the safety appeal of both currencies continued to be undermined by the steady improvement in risk appetite.Sterling climbed to its highest level against the dollar since mid-December while the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars all gained ground against their US counterpart.In commodities, oil touched a six-month high above $60 a barrel before easing back as the US housing data triggered uncertainty about the economic outlook, although the figures helped gold move higher.The Baltic Dry index, a measure of commodity freight rates, struck a fresh 2009 high amid continued strong demand.
978;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-05-17T09:14:24Z;Markit launches carbon indices;;A new range of carbon indices should speed the development of financial markets for the environmental sector.Index provider Markit has joined forces with BlueNext, the Paris-based environmental exchange, to launch a family of indices covering European and global carbon markets.“It’s quite clear that politically it’s top of the agenda,” said Niall Cameron, who looks after commodities and indices at Markit. “There’s a lot of money in subsidies going into these products.”Although he ultimately envisages a broad range of products, the initial offering consists of just two spot price indices, covering European Allowance Units and Certified emissions Reductions.Once these are off the ground, Markit and Blue Next will consult with a governance panel drawn from the industry to work out what exactly will be most useful. “You have to take account of the types of index the clients want,” said Mr Cameron. Markit expects the indices to be used as a basis for products such as exchange traded funds.
979;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-05-06T09:37:18Z;Services sector records small growth increase;;The economy is showing signs that it is near to the trough of the recession as data on Wednesday suggested the services sector grew marginally in April for the first time since last summer.The purchasing managers’ index for services, which tracks business activity in private sector services companies apart from retail and distribution, rose from 45.5 last month to 48.7 – its highest level since last August.Any level above 47 has previously tallied with real growth in the service industries that the survey tracks, according to Markit Economics, the polling company which compiles the data.The index rose for the fifth month in a row and follows strong rises in business surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as relatively buoyant sales at high street shops.“A straight comparison against similar official data indicates that the latest reading is consistent with marginal quarterly growth of the services economy,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit.The service sector including both retail and government services makes up about 75 per cent of the economy, so any growth in services is vital to national output levels.Services industries have been in decline for 12 months, according to the purchasing managers’ index. In the first quarter of this year, services recorded the biggest quarterly drop in output since 1979 as gross domestic product fell 1.9 per cent.Economists at Goldman Sachs, whose forecasts are among the more optimistic in the City, said the data on services suggested that the recession was either close to ending or had actually bottomed out in April.Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman, said April’s PMI readings, combined with recent data from the CBI employers’ group on retail, wholesales and motor sales, were “broadly speaking consistent with flat output” in the economy.Many other economists, however, have been predicting that the recession will continue into 2010.The purchasing managers’ indices for manufacturing and services show that business activity in those sectors is stronger in the UK than in the eurozone, the US and Japan. Economists put that down to a boost to UK competitiveness from the sharp fall in the value of sterling and a further sell-off of inventories by companies.However, the outlook for jobs continues to suggest sharp cuts in services sector staffing ahead. Further job losses across the economy and still falling house prices leave a threat that any recovery will be weak.
980;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-05-06T00:25:53Z;Signs of hope emerge in construction industry;;Britain’s hard-hit construction industry last month declined at its slowest pace in seven months, in a further sign that deterioration of the economy is easing.The construction purchasing managers’ index on Tuesday showed a sharp rise from 30.9 in March to 38.1 in April – its highest since September. Any level below 50 still signals contraction in the sector.“The severity of the recession in the UK construction economy moderated noticeably during April,” said the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply and Markit, which compiled the report.The easing of the downturn in construction came as civil engineering activity declined less sharply, a factor that some observers put down to the government’s economic stimulus package.In November’s pre-Budget report, the government promised to bring forward about £3bn ($4.5bn) in spending on infrastructure and housing from the next fiscal year into 2008-09 and 2009-10 in order to boost growth.“We are starting to see the government’s economic stimulus package beginning to make headway, with early signs of infrastructure spending being brought forward, leading to increased civil engineering activity,” said Roy Ayliffe, director at Cips. “As time progresses, we expect to see lots more of this.”The PMI showed that output in housing and commercial property also fell less steeply – with housing construction declining at the slowest rate in a year.Building orders fell at a much slower rate, but companies still cut jobs at near-record rates.Construction makes up only about 6 per cent of the overall output of the UK economy.However, the slower rate of decline comes after similar signs have emerged in other sectors.
981;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-04-28T19:11:59Z;Centrica slides amid London retreat;;Centrica was among the sharpest fallers on Tuesday as the FTSE 100 retreated from a 2½-month high. The British Gas owner slid 5.9 per cent to 225p after Morgan Stanley downgraded to “underweight” and cut profit forecasts 24 per cent.About 60 per cent of Centrica’s group earnings will track lower commodity prices – a trend it said was not well understood by investors, the broker said.Analyst Bobby Chada also saw risks attached to Centrica’s strategy for hedging fuel costs, by buying into Venture Production and British Energy. This risks leaving the group with lower quality and less easily managed assets, he said.“If the hedge is increased Centrica will look like a normal utility, but it will trade at a big premium to most normal utilities. We think this is not justified,” said Morgan Stanley.A bid for Venture, up 0.2 per cent to 796½p, risks “substantial value destruction” and would provide only a short-term hedge, given the maturity of its gas fields, it said.The FTSE 100 closed lower as swine flu focused attention back on the fragile global economy. The index closed down 1.7 per cent, or 70.61 points, at 4,096.4 points.Banks were weak on a report that the US regulator had told Citigroup and Bank of America they may need more capital to meet stress testing standards.Barclays finished down 0.9 per cent to 232¼p, in spite of an upgrade from Nomura. HSBC lost 2 per cent to 457p and Lloyds Banking Group was 4.9 per cent weaker at 95.6p.Weaker than expected first-quarter results sent Friends Provident lower by 4.8 per cent to 59.3p.Miners were the sharpest fallers as metals prices trended lower. Rio Tinto led the blue-chip loserboard, down 6.3 per cent to £25.18.Ferrexpo was an exception, rising 2.3 per cent to 134½p. The iron ore producer has nearly trebled since March, amid speculation about the long-term intentions of Kostyantin Zhevago, its majority shareholder.Home Retail Group led the retailers lower, losing 4.6 per cent to 270p. In a preview of its full-year results due on Wednesday, ING said the shares looked overvalued at 19 times its 2010 profit forecast and repeated a “sell” rating.Among the defensive stocks to find favour, Imperial Tobacco was up 1.8 per cent to £15.52 and British American Tobacco rose 0.8 per cent £15.97.Associated British Foods climbed 0.7 per cent to 715p, helped by a note from Redburn Partners forecasting European sugar demand to outstrip supply in 2009.“The EU sugar market is now extremely tight with almost six million tonnes of capacity having been removed as part of sugar regime reform,” said analyst Jeremy Fialko.“Imported sugar will be priced at a premium, driving up the EU market clearing price and AB Foods’ margins. Whilst AB Foods is a diversified group, the doubling of sugar profits we forecast from 2008-10 should lead to EPS meaningfully ahead of the consensus.”Cadbury was up 0.3 per cent to 508p ahead of a trading update tomorrow. Sector consolidation talk also helped, with Cadbury’s US partner Hershey once again rumoured to be a possible target for Nestlé.Liberty International finished well off session lows after it raised £620m before expenses with a share placing. The shopping centre developer sold the stock at 310p, a much higher price than many analysts were expecting. Liberty closed down 1.8 per cent to 425p, having reached a session low of 387½p at the open in response to the plan.Housebuilders were weak for a second day, with Barratt Development losing 8.4 per cent to 138¼p and Persimmon off 6.3 per cent to 366¼p. Panmure Gordon downgraded both stocks in response to Tuesday’s weaker than expected UK mortgage approval figures.Investec “buy” advice pushed QinetiQ, the defence contractor, up 5.3 per cent to 133¾p.London Stock Exchange lost 0.9 per cent to 702½p after it was once again mooted as a potential bidder for Boat, the trade reporting platform owned by Markit. Private equity firm General Atlantic was also linked with Boat, which analysts have valued at around £2.5bn.
982;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-04-23T21:33:46Z;Overview: Stocks falter over differing economic signals;;Conflicting signals on the health of the global economy and the banking sector sparked a divergence between US and European equities and failed to enhance the safety appeal of the dollar or the yen, while UK government bonds suffered from worries over supply.The figures on eurozone manufacturing and service-sector activity beat expectations and provided an early boost to investor risk appetite as they helped offset the International Monetary Fund’s cut to its growth forecast for the region. “The first signs of improvement in the eurozone business cycle are starting to emerge,” said Marco Valli, economist at UniCredit.“Today’s data contain some clearly positive news, particularly in manufacturing, that make us more confident that we will see an easing in the pace of recession starting from the second quarter.”Eurozone industrial orders declined in February, “but showed signs of stabilisation”, according to Barclays Capital.The more positive view was further encouraged by better than forecast French business confidence data and a slightly better tone to the latest industrial trends survey from the CBI, the UK employers’ organisation.Good news also came on the banking front as first-quarter profits at Credit Suisse easily beat expectations and Barclays in the UK pledged to resume dividend payments in the second half of this year.Japanese investors managed to shrug off local press reports that Nomura would report a record annual loss due to the cost of buying up operations from collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers.The more confident mood in Europe then faltered as US labour and housing market data failed to impress. Continued jobless claims reached a fresh record high last week, while sales of existing homes fell by 3 per cent last month.“Sharply lower mortgage rates are still failing to convince people to step back into the housing market,” said Dimitry Fleming, economist at ING.The mood was also dented by a poor outlook statement from United Parcel Service – often considered a bellwether of the US economy – and equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic turned lower early in New York.But, the S&P 500 subsequently rallied in late trade and closed up 1 per cent, after the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gave up an early advance to finish 0.4 per cent lower.Asian markets, had staged a modest rebound following recent losses. The Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.4 per cent, while Hong Kong climbed 2.3 per cent.Credit markets outperformed equities, with the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index down 3 basis points at 152bp and its US counterpart, the Markit CDX North America index, down 3.5bp at 180bp.Government bonds were divergent. After a weak start US Treasury prices rallied after a well received sale of five-year inflation bonds.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell 2bp to 2.93 per cent, after rising above 2.98 per cent in early trade amid concerns about the level of new supply coming to the market next week.Issuance worries did weigh on UK gilts after the Budget on Wednesday. The Treasury will issue a record £220bn of securities this year – more than observers had expected.The yield on the 10-year gilt rose a further 9bp to a seven-week high of 3.51 per cent after climbing 12bp in the previous session.In Germany, the yield on the 10-year Bund rose 1bp to 3.23 per cent.In the currency markets, the euro pushed above $1.31, boosted by eurozone purchasing managers’ index data, while the dollar was undermined by the US housing and employment figures.The euro also gained ground against the yen as appetite for the “riskier” single currency was heightened by the early gains for Asian stocks.Sterling managed to rebound against the leading currencies after falling sharply following the Budget.In commodities, gold rose above $900 an ounce as the dollar weakened and the outlook for the US economy turned more uncertain.Copper fell back in line with losses for equities, while the benchmark US crude oil price rose to just below $50 a barrel. Brent crude also rose and closed above $50.
983;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-04-07T21:28:42Z;Overview: Gloomy cocktail triggers risk-aversion;;A gloomy cocktail of nervousness about the forthcoming US earnings season, renewed worries about the global banking sector and grim eurozone economic data triggered a rise in investor risk-aversion on Tuesday.Furthermore, central bank actions in the Asia-Pacific region did little to bolster confidence in the global economic outlook. The Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged and widened the range of collateral it would accept against loans in a bid to help regional banks, while the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates by 25 basis points to a record low of 3 per cent.Equity markets retreated virtually across the board, with banking stocks undermined by reports that the International Monetary Fund was poised to raise its forecast sharply of the level of toxic assets on financial institutions’ balance sheets.In New York, the S&P 500 closed down 2.4 per cent ahead of first-quarter results from Alcoa, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 per cent.The mood was mostly negative in Asia too, with the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo down 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong down 0.5 per cent.Kevin Gardiner, head of global equity strategy at HSBC, said the market still faced technical challenges and that first-quarter results were not going to be pretty. But he added: “Risk appetite does seem to have bounced by more than it did after November, albeit from lower levels.“More objectively, the threat of banking collapse has likely faded in the face of the massive assistance pledged by the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury and the inventory overhang may have peaked. Even the US housing market data feels a little more balanced than it did.”Credit spreads widened, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits rising 16 basis points to 931bp and investment-grade indices rising on both sides of the Atlantic.The weaker tone in equity markets helped push government bonds higher. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was down 4bp to 2.90 per cent, while the two-year yield was 4bp lower at 0.92 per cent.European bonds received an additional boost from a downward revision to fourth-quarter eurozone gross domestic product data.The two-year Schatz yield fell 4bp to 1.46 per cent after data showed that the region’s economy shrank by 1.6 per cent in the past three months of 2008, compared with a previous estimate of a 1.5 per cent contraction.“Worryingly, it is far from inconceivable that eurozone GDP contraction was even deeper in the first quarter of 2009, given largely dire data and survey evidence,” said Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight.“This will hopefully have marked the low point in the downturn, although recovery currently still looks some way away.”The gap between 10-year Irish yields over 10-year German bunds widened to 206bp after Dublin unveiled its latest budget proposals to tackle the financial crisis facing the country.UK gilts recovered from an early slide prompted by a relatively disappointing auction of 10-year securities. The 10-year yield rose 1bp to 3.45 per cent.On the currency markets, the euro was hurt by the deteriorating outlook for the eurozone economy, while the dollar benefited from the rise in risk aversion.The greenback rose 1 per cent against the single currency and gained ground against the Swiss franc and sterling, but retreated against the firmer yen.The dollar also gained ground against its Australian counterpart following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate cut.But Gabriel Stern at Lombard Street Research said that Tuesday’s cut might be the last in the current cycle if the countries most important for Australia – the US and China – show signs of recovery in the second half.“It seems that the RBA will want to hold off any further interest rate cuts until it has gauged the effect of what already has taken place,” he said.In commodities, the US crude price dipped below $50 a barrel as the market tracked losses in equities and came under pressure from demand worries. But gold bounced off a 2½-month low struck on Monday, although its advance was limited by the firmer tone of the dollar.
984;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-04-01T09:39:02Z;Decline in UK manufacturing slows in March;Glimmer of hope but sector still in distress;The UK manufacturing sector declined at a slower pace in March, adding to signs that the recession may be near its deepest point, data published on Wednesday suggested.The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to its highest level since last October and has now risen for three out of the last four months.But the reading of 39.1, up from 34.9 in February, is still close to the lowest levels that the index has recorded since collection of the data began in 1992. Any figure below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.Economists said that although it added to recent glimmers of hope that a trough in the downturn may have been reached in the first quarter, the manufacturing sector and the economy as a whole are still in deep distress.“The substantial gains in the output and new orders indexes are heartening and, if these can be sustained during the coming months, raise hopes that manufacturers are past the worst,” said Rob Dobson of Markit Economics. “However, we are still a long way off levels associated with an outright recovery and conditions remain fragile overall.”Colin Ellis, an economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC, said the data “lends support to our view that [the first quarter] may turn out to be the nadir of the recession, with growth slowly heading back up to zero over the rest of this year.”The manufacturing survey showed that stock levels fell sharply and reached a new record low - suggesting that companies have sold off many of the widgets sitting on their shelves and may soon have to increase production to meet orders.New orders fell at a notably slower pace, as did output. Manufacturers also shed jobs at a slower pace - with 20,000 to 25,000 jobs being lost in March compared to 30,000 in January, according to the Chartered Institute for Purchasing Suppliers and Markit, which produce the report.The sharp fall in sterling may have been responsible in part for the slowing decline in new orders, economists said, pointing to a smaller drop in export orders. The UK PMI is now also at its highest compared to eurozone PMI since 1997.Nevertheless the index suggests manufacturing has now been in recession for a full year.Separately, Bank of England data showed that homeowners ploughed more money into paying off their mortgages at a record pace in the final quarter of last year. Homeowners paid back a net total of £8bn of their mortgages between October and December, which made up 3.3 per cent of their post tax income. In contrast, net housing equity withdrawal was 6.2 per cent income after tax in the first quarter of 2007.Both figures were the highest since records began in 1970, and confirm the sharp rise in the household savings rate seen in the quarter. Some see the rapid pace in which consumers are paying back debts and increasing savings as a sign that the economy is closer to rebalancing. But there is also a risk that consumers retrench too quickly, reducing the effectiveness of quantitative easing and deepening the recession.“Given the structurally impaired nature of the UK economy - an impairment centred firmly upon an absence of domestic savings - such a development is to be welcomed, said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The pace with which this rebalancing is occurring, however, will be of some considerable concern for policy makers owing to the threat of this process both limiting the effectiveness of the QE project and prolonging the current slowdown. “
985;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-03-09T22:27:45Z;Overview: Japan deficit highlights export carnage;;Japanese stocks dropped to their lowest levels for more than a quarter of a century on Monday, setting the tone for yet another nervous session for equity investors in Europe and the US.Even news of a $41bn takeover in the US pharmaceuticals sector did little to lift the gloom as worries about the banking sector and the broader economic outlook continued to dominate sentiment.Steve Barrow, strategist at Standard Bank, described the mood in the markets as “ugly”.“There’s no sign at all of any sort of economic improvement, so government bonds are set to stay firm, equities are likely to plummet some more and most currencies will stay weak against the dollar,” he said.Valentin Marinov at Commerzbank said: “ Weak fundamental data from developed and developing economies alike in the coming days could add to investor gloom by confirming that a turning point in the global cycle remains quite distant.”Both Japanese stocks and the yen came under pressure after news that the country had recorded its first current account deficit in 13 years in January.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics noted that the number was not seasonally adjusted, but added that the adjusted surplus – of just Y258bn ($2.6bn) – was the smallest since March 1991.“The disappearance of Japan’s current account surplus largely reflects the collapse in exports and the loss of overseas investment income,” Mr Jessop said. “The only certainty is that a key support for the yen is being kicked away.”Indeed, the yen lost ground against both the dollar and the euro, while the Nikkei 225 Average – Japan’s most widely-watched equity indicator – fell 1.2 per cent to its lowest close since October 1982.The mood was gloomy in most other Asian stock markets as financial stocks took another beating.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 4.8 per cent as HSBC shares tumbled 24 per cent amid talk of hefty fund selling.European stocks lost ground as losses for financials offset gains in the energy sector on the back of rising crude prices. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 per cent.Wall Street suffered an extremely volatile session and the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent in late trade to close at a fresh 12-year low.Credit indices widened as bank bondholders continued to fret about the outlook for the sector in spite of the UK government’s weekend move to raise its stake in Lloyds Banking Group.The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index climbed 5 basis points to 207bp, while its US counterpart, the Markit CDX North America index, widened 11bp to a 12-week high of 261bp.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits also rose but stayed clear of the record wides seen at the end of last week.Government bond markets continued to focus on new supply.In the US, the prospect of $63bn of notes and bonds coming to market this week helped push the yield on the 10-year Treasury up 6bp to 2.89 per cent.In Europe, the Schatz yield climbed 11bp to 1.27 per cent as investors braced for €8bn ($10.1bn) auction of two-year German paper on Wednesday.UK Gilts initially extended last week’s strong gains as investors continued to respond positively to the Bank of England’s move to quantitative easing.The yield on the 10-year Gilt touched 2.95 per cent, the lowest since records began in the 1950s, although it went into reverse to end the day 8bp higher at 3.13 per cent.Meanwhile, sterling was a feature on the currency markets as it dropped to a six-week low against the dollar amid fears about the UK financial sector.The dollar was one of the big currency winners on Monday as nervousness in equity markets continued to prompt haven buying.In commodities, US light crude advanced towards the $50 a barrel level amid speculation that Opec might agree to further production cuts when it meets this weekend.The cartel has already delivered about 80 per cent of a promised cut of 4.2m barrels a day from its September output level.Gold retreated further from recent highs above $1,000 an ounce as investors booked profits and the dollar continued to attract buyers.
986;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-03-04T10:48:19Z;Hopes rise for UK service sector;;Britain’s services sector, the single largest contributor to economic activity, appears to be faring better than its continental European cousins, according to data published on Wednesday.The Purchasing Managers Institute Services Index showed the sector continued to contract in February. However, the headline Index reading of 43.2 was the latest in a series of small, but steady, incremental increases since the record low of 40.1 reached in November 2008. Any reading below 50 shows contraction while those above indicate expansion.Moreover, the new business sub-component registered 42.5, the strongest reading since last September. Markit, which distributes the Index, noted reports of uncertainties undermining demand, with clients delaying spending decisions and non-essential expenditure.Alan Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas, noted that the rise in the headline Index was its third in a row. “Clearly it is too soon to conclude that the worst is in the past and the index remains very weak indeed, consistent with GDP shrinking by more that 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year.”He added that renewed financial market tensions could easily prompt a reversal of the trend. “But for now, the survey provides tentative confirmation that the worst time for growth in the services sector was around the turn of the year,” he said.The data are in contrast with a similar survey of eurozone economies. These showed record falls in activity, new business, backlogs of work, employment, input costs and output prices. They also showed a dip in future expectations, which still remained above last year’s lows. The survey also found that rates of decline gathered pace in the four largest eurozone economies.Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit Economics, said: ““The latest data provide further hope that the UK service sector is past the worst point in its downturn, with rates of decline in activity and new business continuing to ease from the records seen last November, while a continued steady improvement in sentiment further bolsters hopes of recovery. “
987;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-03-03T22:46:37Z;Overview: Investors fearful after Fed warning;;"There was no respite for the world’s equity markets yesterday as investors remained nervous about the outlook for the financial sector and the global economy.The mood in the markets mirrored cautious comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.He warned that policymakers might need to provide further aid to the banking system beyond the $700bn already approved, and urged further aggressive action to bolster the economy.The Fed and the Treasury yesterday announced details of its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (Talf), which they said could generate up to $1,000bn of lending.“The programme could represent a turning point
for the economy and the financial markets by jump-starting lending in critical areas of the economy and by reviving the asset-backed securities market, where issuance has slowed to a crawl,” said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak.Further evidence of the headwinds facing the global economy came from grim US pending home sales data and news that Switzerland’s economy had officially entered a recession.China sounded a brighter note when the vice-governor of the People’s Bank of China said a Chinese recovery was “very likely” in first half of 2009.Equity markets were subdued, but the S&P 500 closed below 700 points – a level last reached in October 1996 – for a loss of 0.6 per cent on the day.The Vix index of equity volatility – also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – eased but stayed above 50.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell by
1.9 per cent to the lowest close in its 12-year history, while in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average shed 0.7 per cent, after slipping to within a whisker of a 26-year low.Lack of confidence in equities sent European junk-rated credit spreads sharply wider. The Markit iTraxx Crossover index – widely considered as a useful barometer of risk appetite – hit a record high of 1,123 basis points. Investment-grade spreads in the US pushed wider.Foreign exchange markets experienced a shift towards high-yield currencies after the Reserve Bank of Australia unexpectedly left interest rates on hold at 3.25 per cent.The RBA said domestic demand in Australia had not weakened as much as in other countries and that its financial system remained strong.The move helped propel the Australian dollar sharply higher against its US counterpart and the Japanese yen.The Bank of Canada cut interest rates by 50bp to 0.5 per cent, as expected, and again noted that the global outlook had deteriorated since its last meeting. It said it was considering further additional easing measures beyond interest rate moves.“Regardless of whether we get to that point or not, this is an important signal as
it will calm general fears that the bank will be ineffective in helping bolster the economy further through monetary policy,” said Sacha
Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital.The Bank of England, which begins a two-day
policy meeting today, is widely expected to announce quantitative easing to boost the economy.John Wraith at RBC Capital Markets, warned that the strategy was highly risky and its impact was unpredictable.“Its eventual unwinding will be fraught with dangers – reversing the policy too soon risks tipping the
economy back into deep recession, whereas acting too slowly or too late will
court a serious inflationary surge.”Expectations that the bank would start buying short-dated UK government bonds pushed the yield on the two-year gilt down 8bp to 1.27 per cent. But most other bond prices fell as investors took profits on the previous session’s gains.The 10-year US Treasury yield was steady at 2.92 per cent, while the 10-year Bund yield added 1bp to 3.04 per cent.In commodities, gold continued to fall towards $900 a troy ounce – little more than a week after hitting
an 11-month high above $1,000.Oil prices steadied after suffering steep falls on Monday. ICE Brent crude rose $1.49 to close at $43.70
a barrel."
988;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;iTraxx Crossover index hits record high;;Tensions rose in the credit and money markets on Tuesday as important indicators of stress reached record levels.The Markit iTraxx Cross-over index, a closely watched gauge of sentiment in the credit markets, hit the highest level in its five-year history, implying that a record number of sub-investment grade companies in Europe are edging towards being unable to meet debt obligations.Stress in the short-term money markets also reached record levels for this year amid increasing fears for the health of the financial sector, particularly in the UK.The spread between sterling overnight market rates and London interbank offered rates – considered a pure measure of short-term credit risk – rose to 164 basis points compared with 127bp on January 21.Liquidity in the sterling money markets has been particularly poor this week too, reflecting mounting concerns over the fate of banks.The iTraxx Crossover index, which measures the cost of protection against junk-rated companies defaulting on debt using credit default swaps, rose to 1,123bp, climbing above the previous all-time high of 1,120bp reached in December.This means the risk premium for a five-year CDS contract written on the index now stands €1.1m ($1.4m) per year on a notional amount of €10m.The index, viewed as a barometer of stress in credit markets, has widened sharply in recent days after a spate of grim economic data sent global stock markets tumbling.“Investment grade credit has already been telling us this is going to be at least the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” said Andrea Cicione, a credit strategist at BNP Paribas. “Sub-investment grade spreads were showing things will only be as bad as the late 1980s, which now looks unrealistic, so they are catching up.”The sterling overnight indexed swap spread, which measures the gap between sterling market rates and three-month Libor, has jumped by 40bp since the middle of January, or 30 per cent, as UK banks’ shares have come under increasing pressure because of continuing worries about the health of their balance sheets.“The greatest concerns are over the UK banking sector, more so than in the US and Europe, which explains why sterling rates have moved sharply higher in the money markets,” said Don Smith, economist at inter-dealer broker Icap.“There are real worries over the solvency of the banks in the UK, and these have increased in the past few weeks.”Spreads between dollar and euro market rates and Libor have also increased because of doubts over the financial sector, but not so sharply.The current dollar spread is 102bp compared with 91bp on January 21.The current euro spread is 98bp compared with this year’s low of 88bp on February 2.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated corporate debt widened to 1,123 basis points, meaning it costs €1,123,000 annually to purchase five years of protection on a notional amount of €10 million.Europe’s insurers were the worst performers, with their CDS spreads widening as the value of their equity continued to shrink on renewed worries over their solvency.The cost of purchasing protection against a default by France’s Axa rose by 28bp to 211bp. Aviva, the world’s fifth largest insurance group, widened by 34bp to 295bp, while spreads on Holland’s Aegon were pushed out by 42bp to 436bp.The iTraxx Europe index of mostly investment grade names – seen as a useful indicator of credit sentiment towards the continent’s banks – widened by 4.2bp to 193bp.
989;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-02-24T19:14:26Z;Overview: Wall Street rebounds after Bernanke remarks;;US stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday from the previous session’s 12-year lows, although their European and Asian counterparts continued to slide amid persistent concerns that the global recession was deepening.Alec Young, international equity strategist at S&P Equity Research, said that equity markets were suffering “death by a thousand cuts”. He pointed to increasingly negative revisions to global growth and earnings estimates and said each round of cuts was prompting falls in equity markets to price in a weaker economic and earnings per share outlook.“Repeated false dawns have conditioned equity investors to sell rallies on fears of further deterioration in the global economic and profit outlook,” he said. “The strong likelihood of further fundamental erosion means this bear market is likely not over.”The latest US and European economic reports did little to dispel the gloom.The US Conference Board’s consumer confidence index plunged to 25 in February from a revised 37.4 in January – the lowest since the survey began in 1967 – while the German Ifo business confidence index also hit a record low this month.US house prices, meanwhile, continued to see record falls in December.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged in testimony to Congress that the economy was enduring a “severe contraction” and that any recovery depended on the Fed and the Treasury restoring stability to financial markets.Paul Dales at Capital Economics said Mr Bernanke had thrown up few surprises but for the third time in as many addresses the Fed chief had not floated the possibility of the central bank’s buying Treasury securities, suggesting that the plan was on the back-burner for the foreseeable future.“The Fed wants to gauge the success of its existing programmes and the new Term Asset-backed Securities Loan Facility first, which could take at least six months,” Mr Dales said.Mr Bernanke encouraged a round of bargain-hunting in US equities, led by a 12 per cent surge in financials, after he said that nationalisation of banks was not likely. The S&P 500 rose 4 per cent.In contrast, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell by 1.4 per cent to a fresh six-year low. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo fell 1.5 per cent to within a striking distance of a 26-year trough.However, Kit Juckes, head of debt market research at Royal Bank of Scotland, noted that while equity markets were hitting lows, other markets, such as credit and bonds, appeared relaxed.“Perhaps the biggest surprise is that there is a certain calm in the world of equities,” Mr Juckes said.The CBOE Vix volatility index – also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – dropped below the 50 level on Tuesday, having been above 80 last autumn.European credit spreads were mixed, reflecting doubts over government efforts to stabilise the financial sector and persistent uncertainty about bank nationalisations.The investment grade Markit iTraxx Europe index widened 3 basis points to 183bp, while the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits, was at 1,076bp, 7bp tighter.George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS, said that though governments wanted to avoid having to nationalise insolvent financial entities, time was running out.“There may indeed be no alternative now to the need to ‘fix’ the inadequacy of bank capital and the isolation of bad assets,” he said. “And it may be cleaner, and in the end cheaper than the avoidance strategies.”US government bonds reversed early gains in the wake of Mr Bernanke’s remarks, the sustained rally in stocks and the first of this week’s three debt auctions. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up 2 basis points at 2.80 per cent, while the two-year yield rose 2bp to 0.98 per cent, after solid demand for $40bn new two-year notes.In Europe, the 10-year bund yield fell 3bp to 2.99 per cent.In the currency markets, the dollar climbed to a three-month high against the yen as investors continued to question the Japanese currency’s safe-haven status.In commodities, gold retreated from the $1,000 an ounce level breached on Friday, while oil prices found support from talk that Opec would agree supply cuts.
990;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
991;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Taiwan;;"Gremlins had it right: water is the most dangerous element. Of the world’s top five sovereign credit default swap (CDS) blowouts since July 2007, ranked by Markit, two – Austria (3) and Lithuania (5) – are on the Eurasian landmass. The majority are small islands off it: Ireland (1), Iceland (2) and the UK (4).If Taiwan had a sufficiently liquid market in government debt protection, it might be in the mix too. Diplomatically, things are looking up. Since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May, cross-strait relations with China have been characterised more by joint photo-ops than ominous naval manoeuvres. As an export-led economy, Taiwan was always going to be bent double by the contraction in global trade. Figures yesterday revealed output last quarter shrank at the fastest pace on record – more than 8 per cent. Other indicators are also alarming – two straight months of a more than 40 per cent annualised decline in exports and a five-year unemployment high of 5 per cent.The Ma government is doing all it can to arrest the slump. Interest rates, at 1.5 per cent, will almost certainly come down again. If that fails to stir demand, the government will deputise. Its $25bn four-year stimulus package, skewed towards infrastructure, spending vouchers and tax cuts, is one of the world’s most ambitious, equivalent to 7 per cent of output. The increased borrowing should put further pressure on the New Taiwan dollar, already at its lowest levels against the US dollar since Sars.The benighted isle stands to gain from improving sentiment in China: it and Hong Kong bought about 41 per cent of Taiwan’s exports in 2007, up from 27 per cent in 2001. But it will not see a significant rebound unless consumers in the west splurge again on smart phones, televisions and laptops.

992;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-02-13T22:41:17Z;Overview: Signs of deepening recession dent confidence;;Optimism about global efforts to stimulate economic growth turned to scepticism this week as mounting evidence of a deepening recession triggered risk aversion.Equities and high-yielding currencies fell sharply as investors opted for the perceived safety of government bonds, gold and the dollar. Oil prices retreated amid heightened concerns about demand.While a $789bn US stimulus package was widely expected to be passed by Congress, with a vote due in the Senate late on Friday, doubts began to emerge as to how much this would help the economy to recover.Investors were also deeply concerned about a lack of detail in the US Treasury’s revamped plans to clean up toxic assets in the financial system unveiled in the week.“The tug-of-war between the negative momentum in economic activity and the attempts to implement counter-cyclical policies continues,” said Matthew Vogel, analyst at Barclays Capital. “Investors expecting a silver bullet from US policymakers have been disappointed.”Sentiment towards the financial sector was further unsettled by poor figures from European banks, culminating in a downbeat trading update on Friday from the UK’s Lloyds Banking Group.UK monetary policy came into focus after the Bank of England unveiled a stark assessment of the economic outlook and signalled that it would soon embark on a policy of quantitative easing – buying government bonds and other assets.Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that she was unconvinced that this stimulus would drag the economy quickly and sharply out of recession.“The uncertainties surrounding quantitative easing make it hard to believe that the monetary policy committee will manage to pursue just the right amount to get the economy back on track - with by far the biggest risk that they do too little,” she said.“We continue to think that the MPC is being far too optimistic and that a further contraction of the economy next year is likely.”The outlook for the eurozone looked similarly grim. Data released on Friday showed that its economy contracted by 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, the most on record.Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital, noted that this followed the largest quarterly contractions in Germany and France for 20 years and came soon after equally bad news from Italy and Spain, marking the first quarter when all four major eurozone economies had contracted simultaneously under the common currency.“This almost seems to ensure a 50bp [interest rate] cut at the European Central Bank’s next meeting in three weeks,” he said.With Japan expected to confirm next week that its economic performance was even more dire, many investors were looking to emerging markets for signs of life.Danske Bank said: “At the moment it looks as if China and India might be the first major economies to recover from the global financial crisis.”But the signals this week were mixed. Chinese imports plunged by 43.1 per cent in the year to January, while exports dropped 17.5 per cent – although bank lending data painted a more positive picture. In India, industrial output unexpectedly fell.Global equity markets suffered a steep sell-off over the week in spite of brief attempts to rally. The S&P 500 recorded a drop of 4.8 per cent, its worst weekly loss this year, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index shed 3.7 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo also dropped 3.7 per cent.By contrast, the Shanghai composite index closed on Friday at a five-month high.Credit markets showed some disappointment at the US financial stability plan.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index – a widely-watched barometer of risk appetite – widened about 20bp over the week to 1,070bp, although the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe was flat at 155bp.Government bonds benefited from the shift away from equities. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond briefly climbed above 3 per cent at the start of the week as concerns about new supply continued to dominate sentiment. Late Friday, the yield was at 2.89 per cent, 9bp lower on the week.Gains for UK and European bonds were even more dramatic. The yield on the 10-year Gilt ended the week 19bp lower at 3.55 per cent, after sliding 25bp on Wednesday – the biggest single-day drop for at least 10 years. The 10-year Bund yield fell by 28bp to 3.10 per cent.Sterling was among the major losers in the currency markets after the Bank of England’s inflation report. The pound fell 2.6 per cent against the dollar and 1.9 per cent against the euro.In commodities, US light crude tumbled 6.6 per cent over the week after a bleak demand forecast from the International Energy Agency and news of rising stocks at the Cushing oil distribution hub in the US. But the flight to safety by investors helped gold re-test the $950 an ounce level.
993;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-02-09T08:11:52Z;Optimism plunges in Brics countries;;Confidence in the prospects for business this year has plunged dramatically among manufacturers in Brazil, Russia, India and China, in the latest sign that the global economic crisis is still broadening.The steep falls in optimism in the so-called Bric countries came as confidence deteriorated still further in European Union countries, according to the latest KPMG/Markit business outlook survey. The results suggest that the knock-on effects of the slump in economic activity in the world’s largest industrial economies late last year were continuing to play out.“So much for decoupling,” said Andrew Smith, chief economist at KPMG. “The severity of the current weakness in the US, Europe and Japan is clearly hitting the external sectors of the Bric economies hard as export demand and foreign investment weakens.”The survey of 1,800 Bric manufacturers monitors trends in activity by deducting the percentage of companies forecasting a decline in activity in the next 12 months from the percentage expecting an increase. In January, this “net balance” fell to just 3.5, compared with a figure of 47 last July and 64 in January 2008. The latest reading showed only slightly more companies expected an increase in activity than expected a decline.While the degree of pessimism was not as great as in the EU, “it is clear that manufacturers in the Brics are expecting a period of much weaker expansion – a recession in all but name for economies used to far higher growth rates”, said Mr Smith.Among the four countries, sentiment was most positive in Russia, but the latest net balance of 21.2 reported for the country was still sharply lower than the 63.2 reported last July. Pessimism was greatest in Brazil.Bric companies also expected profits to decline, leading them to scale back their investment plans for the year ahead, the survey showed.In the EU, more companies expected business activity to contract in the next 12 months than expected an increase, with the “net balance” dropping to minus 10.2 from plus 14.1 in July.Out of the 11 EU countries surveyed, only three – Italy, the UK and Poland – reported positive net balances. Pessimism was deepest in the Czech Republic and Greece, which had net balances of minus 47.1 and minus 30.6.The slowdown in Europe is also feeding through increasingly into the labour market. The net balance of its manufacturers expecting to increase employment fell from minus 6.9 in July to minus 35.4 in the latest survey.
994;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-27T20:16:18Z;Merrill points to ‘legacy positions’;;Who knew what, and when? The questions continue to hang over Bank of America’s takeover of Merrill Lynch.Already, the revelation of a $15.3bn loss by Merrill Lynch during the fourth quarter has cost John Thain his position at the bank. The losses forced BofA to seek billions of dollars from the US government.Yet, at a December 5 meeting of BofA shareholders, held to approve the deal, Merrill’s potential problems were not discussed.The reason: BofA says it expected some losses at Merrill. It was only in the second week of December that Merrill’s losses swelled beyond the expectations of the Charlotte, North Carolina, bank.“It is a mystery as to why Bank of America says it did not know about the losses at Merrill Lynch until [later in] December,” said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance.“There were huge markets upsets in October and November, and this affected many banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. There are ample reasons to question why there was no discussion [at the shareholder meeting] about the potential risks of further significant writedowns in light of these market upsets,” said Ms Tavakoli.Merrill Lynch reported a modest profit in its investment banking division, and $2.6bn net revenues from its “thundering herd” of financial advisers. All of its losses came from its global markets division, which posted $16.3bn in “negative net revenues” from trading currencies, commodities, fixed-income securities and equities.In its January 16 announcement of the losses, BofA said Merrill’s results included “correlation breakdowns on trading positions in certain businesses”.A breakdown of the results suggest these trading losses could have been as large as $4.9bn.One question being asked by market participants is what “correlation breakdowns” could have occurred in December. They note that market volatility – as measured by the Vix, an index of S&P 500 equity volatility – declined during that period.Other measures of mortgage and credit risk also showed that fears in the markets were subsiding.One possible explanation for the “correlation breakdowns” could involve movements in the currency markets. Between November 28 and December 17, the dollar fell 9 per cent against the yen, winding up below the Y90 level.Market participants also note that an index of credit derivatives based on leveraged loans – the LCDX – fell from 80 at the end of November to 75.18 by December 5 and 72.68 on December 12, according to Markit data. It rebounded to 77 by December 19.The leading index of US investment grade credit risk – the CDX – also deteriorated during the first week of December, closing at around 280 basis points. A week later the index had eased to 262bp and closed out the year below 200bp.Mr Thain has stressed Bank of America knew about Merrill’s exposure, and that most losses were made on so-called “legacy positions” he inherited from his predecessor, Stan O’Neal, on becoming chief executive of Merrill in December 20007.These legacy assets included the toxic securities backed by risky mortgages, which have fallen in value and which are gumming up the world’s financial system.In an CNBC interview on Monday, Mr Thain reiterated that most of the fourth-quarter losses were from “legacy assets” linked to mortgages and credit, and that markets got worse in December.However, a key measure of subprime mortgage risk – the composite price for the ABX triple A index – improved after December 5. After closing at a low of 29.70 on December 3, it rebounded to 30.63 by December 5, and kept rising, ending the year at 39.04.A measure of value of securities backed by commercial mortgages – the triple-A rated CMBX index – rose from a low of 57.24 at the start of December to 61.93 on the fifth of that month.By December 17, it reached 69.41, according to data compiled by Markit.A severe dislocation in 30-year interest rate swap market also started easing in late November and – despite a bout of renewed stress on December 8 – the market steadily recovered for the rest of the month.
995;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-20T19:17:33Z;Overview: No ‘Obama bounce’ for global equities;;"Banking stocks came under further intense pressure on Tuesday as a much-hoped-for “Obama bounce” in global equity markets failed to materialise.Analysts said the renewed uncertainty over the health of the global banking system underlined the difficulties facing the new US president.“One would expect North American equities to show at least a bit of respect and help usher in the new president with a bit of a rally, but no dice here,” said Sacha Tihanyi, strategist at Scotia Capital. He added that any honeymoon period for the markets was likely to be brief as Mr Obama “inherits the economic quagmire we find ourselves in and is faced with the particularly difficult decision on how to best deploy – quickly – the remaining Troubled Asset Relief Programme funds.”By mid-afternoon in New York, the S&P 500 was down 3.6 per cent, and the banking index was at a 14 year low as investors reacted to losses incurred by their European counterparts in the previous session. US markets were closed on Monday.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 2.1 per cent as the banking sub-index shed 7.5 per cent to its lowest level for nearly 16 years.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average lost 2.3 per cent, while the broad MSCI Emerging Market equity index was 2.2 per cent lower.Credit spreads also widened sharply on fears about bank sector losses. The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index rose 8.5bp to 171.50bp and the Markit CDX North America index rose 10bp to 221bp. The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits widened back above 1,000bp.The latest bout of concern about the banks has been largely triggered by the UK government’s latest plans to bail out the sector, which some analysts have warned might still not be sufficient to kick-start lending.“The worst-case scenario for the economy and banks is a vicious circle in which banks don’t lend so borrowers go bust, so banks need to conserve capital and so don’t lend and so on,” said James Invine, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort.“Although we have seen false dawns before, we expect these packages to have a positive impact – but we would caution against expecting too much too soon. Conditions for banks remain hazardous.”On the currency markets, sterling was a major casualty as fears about the UK economic outlook dominated sentiment.“The costs of bailing out the UK banking sector are clearly a major source of sterling’s ongoing weakness, not least because the government has been forced to step in again just three months after it claimed to have tackled the financial crisis head on,” said John Higgins at Capital Economics.Sterling fell below $1.40 to a 7½-year low against the dollar and hit its worst-ever level against the yen.Lutz Karpowitz at Commerzbank said sterling would remain under pressure against the euro and the dollar until this summer.“The outlook for the pound is negative – dismal news from the financial sector in combination with an
economy which is suffering from a deep recession,” he said.The euro also weakened against the dollar as continued fears about credit rating downgrades to peripheral eurozone countries outweighed a third successive rise in the ZEW Institute’s economic sentiment index.UK government bonds remained under pressure on fears about the public borrowing needed to support the banks. There was little reaction by either sterling or gilts to news of a smaller-than-expected drop in UK inflation last month. Analysts said the Bank of England was still likely to cut interest rates to another historic low in February.The yield on the 10-year Gilt rose 8 basis points to 3.51 per cent, while the 10-year German Bund yield rose 5bp to 3.04 per cent.Supply worries also pushed US Treasuries lower as investors focused on the potential costs of the new US administration’s efforts to boost the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 9bp to 2.39 per cent.In commodities, oil prices saw choppy trade ahead of the expiry of the February WTI contract on Nymex on Tuesday. ICE March Brent rose $1 to $45.50 a barrel.Gold rose 2.9 per cent to $860 an ounce as safe-haven buying emerged on the back of the banking sector concerns."
996;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-19T19:47:32Z;Overview: Financial stocks rattled by bail-out;;Financial markets were buffeted by a wave of uncertainty about the banking system on Monday as initial optimism about UK government measures to support the sector gave way to worries that the bail-outs would ultimately prove to be ineffectual.“This will likely be the week of the latest instalment in the ongoing global bank bail-out story,” said Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank.“First up will be the UK and then perhaps a big announcement in the US after [Barack] Obama’s [presidential] inauguration.”The UK government unveiled a further package of measures aimed at kick-starting lending, including guaranteeing toxic assets, and giving the Bank of England authority to buy securities – taking it a step closer to quantitative easing.“It will now be hard to criticise the UK government for lacking the initiative seen so far in the US,” said Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, there is no magic solution to this crisis and even these measures may not be enough to get banks lending at reasonable levels again, at least for some time. We continue to think that state-decreed lending controls, perhaps via widespread nationalisation, may ultimately be required.”Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said: “If the measures succeed in allowing companies to gain access to funds in order to roll over existing debt, that may go some way to alleviating the strain on corporate costs and thus the labour market.“But they are unlikely to do much to stimulate lending to fund new business because corporates will be constrained less by liquidity and more by lack of profitable investment opportunities. Moreover, banks will be much more cautious about lending in future, and are more likely to subject new projects to a greater degree of scrutiny, which will slow the process.”With US investors absent for the Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday, the focus was on the reaction of European equity markets to the bail-out package.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.6 per cent as the banking sub-index tumbled nearly 9 per cent. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 per cent as Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 66 per cent after it warned that its 2008 loss could reach £28bn – a UK corporate record.Asian markets were broadly higher, although the gains were generally muted. Shanghai led the way with a 1.7 per cent rise for the composite index as banks advanced on hopes of sovereign wealth fund buying,In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average was up 0.3 per cent, Hong Kong 0.6 per cent and Seoul climbed 1.4 per cent.Credit spreads were more muted, however. The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index widened just 2.25 basis points to 163.5bp, while the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits, widened 14.25bp to 995bp.UK government bond underperformed their German counterparts as the bail-out move raised the prospect of higher public borrowing. The yield on the 10-year gilt rose 14bp to 3.43 per cent, while the 10-year Bund yield gained 6bp to 2.99 per cent.Bonds issued by peripheral eurozone countries remained on the back foot after Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit rating on Spain, saying economic and financial market conditions had highlighted structural weaknesses in the Spanish economy. Last week, the agency cut its rating on Greece, and there are fears that other eurozone nations might suffer the same fate.On the currency markets, S&P’s move kept up recent pressure on the euro. The single currency was also hurt by news that the European Commission had slashed its growth forecasts for 2009.The EC forecast that the eurozone economy would contract for the first time this year and recover only modestly in 2010.Sterling was the major casualty on the foreign exchanges on concerns about the UK’s move towards quantitative easing.In commodities, oil prices fell, although trading was subdued by the holiday in the US. In electronic trading, Nymex February West Texas Intermediate, due to expire today, fell $2.01 to $34.50 a barrel.Metals prices were mixed, with copper rising 2.5 per cent, but aluminium sliding to a five-year low. Gold eased back as the dollar adopted a firmer tone.
997;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-06T11:32:32Z;Services sector suffers rapid decline;;The UK services industry activity declined at a near record pace in December, forcing companies to lay off staff and slash prices, according to a closely watched survey of the sector published on Tuesday.The Cips/Markit services sector purchasing managers index recorded a reading of 40.2 last month, only barely above the 40.1 level reached in November that was the lowest in the survey’s 12-year history.Economists had expected a worse reading of 39, but the measure still indicates sharp contraction in the industry and underlines that the UK economy sank further into recession into the final three months of the year after contracting by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter.Services companies were cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the series began in December, amid rising spare capacity, efforts to cut costs and bleak forecasts for this year. Weaker demand also forced record price cuts, reinforcing the threat of deflation. The month rounded out the worst year ever for the survey.The continued weakness in the sector is the latest worrying indication of the sharpness of the downturn in the UK economy and will increase pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates sharply when the monetary policy committee makes its decision on Thursday. Most economists think the Bank will cut rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5 per cent, but many also think a 75 or 100 basis point cut is possible.“The near-term outlook for the services economy remains bleak. The VAT reduction aside, firms are now resorting to discounting strategies as part of efforts to drum up new work, but with little success so far, while expectations for future activity remain exceptionally low,” said Paul Smith, economist at Markit Economics. “This has all combined to put companies firmly in recessionary mode, cutting jobs at a rate unprecedented in twelve-and-a-half years of data collection.”The relatively flat level of activity in the services sector, comes after the same index for the manufacturing industry rose slightly in December, and the construction index plunged to a new record low.“Policymakers are clearly concerned about the deflationary consequences of the current downturn, and the further sharp move up in unemployment currently being pointed to by these surveys suggest such fears will only intensify over the coming weeks,” said Janet Henry, an economist at HSBC.
998;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-05T10:39:40Z;UK construction industry hits new low;;The UK construction industry suffered another month of record decline in December, according to a survey of the sector published on Monday that showed all sectors of the industry suffering their worst contraction on record.The Cips/Markit UK construction purchasing managers’ index fell to a level of 29.3 from a reading of 31.8 in November, marking a new low for a survey that began in 1997. This was the 10th successive month that the index has been below 50, which is the level indicating contraction in the industry.“The new year spirit was decidedly muted among UK constructors amid reports of ever toughening market conditions,” said Roy Ayliffe, a director at Cips. “Further falls in global demand resulted in the most severe retrenchment in the PMI’s 11-year history.”Activity fell in all three sub-sectors of the construction industry at the fastest pace on record. Housing suffered the sharpest decline, while both civil engineering and commercial construction fell at record rates in December.Cips said that the ongoing deterioration in the index reflected “companies’ concerns that the ongoing economic crisis shows little sign of relenting”.The worsening state of the construction industry will add further pressure on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to slash interest rates when it meets on Thursday. The MPC has already cut by three percentage points to 2 per cent in its last three meetings, and is expected to cut by at least a further 50 basis points this time around. If rates are cut to 1.5 per cent, it would be the lowest level since 1694.“The deepening construction downturn reinforces belief that the overall economy will suffer sharper contraction in the fourth quarter and reinforces already intense pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates aggressively further on Thursday,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.The series showed a record fall in new orders for work and for the seventh month in a row the industry saw job cuts. Jobs continued to be lost at a considerable rate in December, although at a slightly slower pace than in the previous month.The “sharp retrenchment in total industry activity, combined with the general gloom pervading throughout the economy, culminated in both a pessimistic outlook for the sector over the next year and another considerable round of job-shedding,” said Gemma Wallace, economist at Markit.Builders responded to the record declines in activity by cutting back on their input buying at the fastest rate since the survey began.Input price deflation continued in December, but price drops were less severe than in November. Lower input costs were generally attributed to reduced raw material prices, with steel in particular singled out.Business expectations for the industry fell into negative territory for only the second time in the surveys’ history as continued financial and economic problems, alongside sharp falls in new business and activity, further hit confidence.
999;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2009-01-04T19:03:22Z;Credit squeeze hits larger companies hardest;;Large companies in Europe and the US are having the terms of their credit facilities tightened more quickly and more severely than smaller companies – in contradiction of received wisdom.Surveys by the European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Germany’s Ifo economics institute all show banks tightening their lending criteria most for the largest companies.Possible reasons put forward for this shift in attitude include smaller companies enjoying a better relationship with their banks, and financial institutions shying away from making large loans and preferring to deal with local groups, rather than multinationals.Chris Williamson, chief economist of Markit data provider, said: “Large companies drove the credit-fuelled expansion but – especially in November – we have seen a big reversal of that”.André Kunkel, head of surveys at Ifo, said: “For the last few years, big companies consistently had it easier but then, in recent months, they saw a huge worsening in credit conditions. Lending terms have dramatically tightened for big companies.”Banks in the eurozone have tightened the credit conditions for 68 per cent of large companies but only 56 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), according to the European Central Banks latest survey.Similarly, the Fed’s latest lending survey shows that 95 per cent of banks have tightened conditions for large companies whereas only 90 per cent have done so for smaller ones.Ifo’s figures for December in Germany are even more dramatic, with the number of large companies reporting tightened loan terms more than doubling from August to 48 per cent. By contrast, only 36 per cent of mid-sized companies and 35 per cent of small companies reported stricter terms.Some analysts suggest the difference in approach is to do with a re-evaluation of risk. Mr Williamson said: “SMEs are seen as less risky if you are the lending risk officer for a bank, as the risk of default for large companies is at an all-time high”.Philip Isherwood, European equity strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, suggested it could be simply that banks had applied far laxer conditions to larger companies previously and were “now playing catch-up”.Mr Kunkel also underlined how the largest companies often had alternative sources of financing such as bonds and rights issues while small companies were dependent on their house banks.In Germany, many small companies deal with Sparkassen, local savings banks that have been relatively untouched by the financial crisis and have in many cases increased their lending.But small companies are still suffering from a lack of credit and a number of industry associations across Europe have sounded the alarm about viable businesses being in danger because of difficulties in finding finance.Mr Williamson said banks might also prefer to deal with local companies, where they know the business and the customers, rather than with multinationals, where problems might be hidden overseas.Large companies across Europe are also seeing production and employment fall faster than at smaller groups, according to a Markit survey.
1000;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-12-21T22:33:45Z;Debt refinancing crunch looms;;2009 will be the toughest year in decades for European companies as $800bn in debt comes due for refinancing and profits continue to drop throughout the entire year.Large companies are likely to respond by cutting thousands of jobs and closing factories as they continue to issue profit warnings in the early part of the year.Equity strategists expect earnings to pick up only in 2010 and think there could be falls of up to 30 per cent at European companies in 2009. The picture in debt markets is even gloomier as Standard & Poor’s estimates about $600bn in debt from financial companies and $200bn from non-financial companies will need to be refinanced. That is higher than is forecast for any year in the next decade.Philip Isherwood, equity strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The starting point is poor because we went into this with record levels of debt and profitability.“There are lots of negatives from gearing to the fact that the bankruptcy cycle will be at its worse next year,”.Many companies have largely written off prospects for growth in 2009 as a deep recession bites across Europe and in most of the western world.John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express, the parcel delivery company owned by Germany’s Deutsche Post, said: “My gut feeling is we’ll have a very tough 2009 and we won’t see a rebound really until the second half of 2010,” .Warren East, chief executive of ARM Holdingschip designer, said he expected little recovery even in 2010: “I wouldn’t necessarily expect 2010 to be a year of massive growth.”The sagging profitability of European companies is increasingly likely to be felt in unemployment and bankruptcy statistics next year. Chris Williamson, chief economist of Markit data provider, said: “The recession in Europe is hitting larger companies harder now and that suggests we will see a lot more job losses next year.”Bankruptcies in western Europe are likely to surge from 149,000 in 2007 to 197,000 next year, according to Euler Hermes, the world’s largest credit insurer.Enormous amounts of debt will mature in 2009 after a year in which all but the best-rated issuers have had difficulties raising finance. Analysts say the pressure will increase on the worst-rated borrowers as quality issuers will be able to refinance, at a price. “The turn of the profit cycle has a nasty habit of exposing bad business models and weak balance sheets,” Mr Isherwood said.Speculative grade, or junk-rated, companies have found it all but impossible to refinance recently, while the spreads for A rated companies such as carmaker Daimler are up to 20 times higher than they were two or three years ago.
1001;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
1002;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-12-15T22:27:32Z;Borrowing costs set to fall;;Businesses and homeowners should see borrowing costs fall and availability of loans improve after Alistair Darling cut the fees the government charges to guarantee bank borrowing on Monday.The Treasury has been considering extra help for Britain’s banks and changes to the current £250bn credit guarantee scheme as it considers how to ease tight credit conditions. Lenders were told last Thursday that there would have to be a quid pro quo for any extra help, such as an increase in their lending.“Banks are beginning to extend lending, but there is a great deal more to be done,” the chancellor told parliament. “By the end of this year we expect some £100bn will be extended.”Mr Darling is expected to announce other far-reaching measures – including possible taxpayer guarantees over business lending – in the new year.Banks welcomed Monday’s move, but some analysts were sceptical about whether the fee cut – which for three of the biggest banks amounts to at most a quarter of 1 percentage point – would be enough to make any difference.The biggest winner is expected to be HBOS, which could see its fees reduced by 41 basis points – or almost half a percentage point – according to calculations by Markit Group. The UK’s biggest mortgage lender, however, still has the highest overall fee at almost 125bp.Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers Association, said: “This is extremely important and everything counts. This will make the scheme less expensive for many banks who are using it.”Banks are more able to pass on this fee cut to customers because it directly affects their costs of funding, whereas interest rate cuts can take time to influence what banks themselves must pay to borrow.The UK scheme was one of the most expensive, with only Germany charging fees on the same basis. Banks must pay 50bp plus a rate based on the average cost of insuring their bonds against default over one year.Initially, the year over which the average was taken included September and early October when markets were thrown into turmoil by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The period has been moved to finish in July 2008, cutting out the worst of the turmoil and so reducing fees, which banks had argued were punitive.“This is everything we have been pushing for and it will make a difference to funding costs as the scheme was too expensive,” said one UK bank.Mr Darling also announced an extension in the length of the credit guarantee scheme from three to five years and a widening of the range of currencies under which debt can be issued to make it attractive to more investors.Meanwhile, ministers pledged an extra £100m on Monday to top up a scheme to help first-time buyers, in a bid to prop-up the struggling construction industry.
1003;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;A clear advantage in turbulent times;;Sometimes, it pays to be boring. While the financial crisis has decimated banks’ trading desks, the unglamorous back office and risk management businesses that have gone largely unnoticed for years are emerging as beneficiaries of the turmoil.In the past six months, London-based clearing house LCH.Clearnet has increased its IT staff by 27 per cent and its risk and operations staff by 12 per cent.The Chicago-based Options Clearing Corporation, the largest clearer of derivatives in the world, plans to hire staff next year.And Nasdaq OMX, the US-based group best known for running the technology-rich Nasdaq market, has in the past two months been pushing into clearing – the business of providing the guarantees that parties to a trade do not default.In October, it bought a stake in EMCF, a European clearer established a year earlier by Fortis that clears for Chi-X, the alternative equities platform. At the same time, Nasdaq launched a clearing service for its Nordic markets.Nasdaq has also invested in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new derivatives exchange and clearing house for over-the-counter interest rate swaps. It also plans to launch a US equities clearing service.In normal times, these developments would go barely noticed. Yet clearing and settlement, as well as the “front office” risk management services that accompany trading, are receiving unprecedented attention as regulators figure out what the future shape of financial services should be.Jeff Gooch, head of valuations and co-head of trade processing at Markit, a market data provider, says: “It’s the one thing people are not willing to cut. Given what’s happened it’s vastly more important to get your risk management right.”In the latest development, List, an Italian technology provider, on Tuesday launched FMR Position Keeping, a system that provides market makers with a “real-time” view of their positions across interest rate futures, credit default swaps and bonds.The developments are an early sign of the type of businesses likely to thrive in an era when financial services emerge redefined, after the excessive risk-taking that led to the worst financial crisis in a generation.They also imply a shift away from the creation of and trading in complex financial instruments – the front office – and more emphasis on post-trade and risk management – the back office.Philippe Carrel, vice-president of risk at Thomson Reuters, says: “In a market like this are you going to ask your boss to invest in trading faster and in new derivatives? No, you are going to try and ensure your risk is understood and controlled and create some watertight compartments and say ‘at least within these boundaries we know what we are doing’.”In credit derivatives, regulators are pushing for a clearing mechanism for over-the-counter credit default swaps to reduce counterparty risk after the Lehman default.Exchanges and clearers are investing in OTC clearing – hence the rise in staff numbers at LCH.Clearnet, which is involved in a NYSE Euronext-led effort to clear CDS products.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, says the clearer’s recent growth has been “driven by the demand for us to clear new markets”.Icap, the inter-dealer broker, also plans to expand into OTC post-trade services. It has identified $12bn in risk capital tied up by dealers in their portfolios that could be saved by offering clearing in OTC derivatives, foreign exchange and other products.Even shipping is getting attention. Imarex, a Norwegian shipping derivatives exchange, has launched a position netting service to help participants in the dry freight forward contracts market reduce their financing needs.Demand for such services is likely to grow, industry experts say, because the boards of banks and asset managers will be asking more questions about how their risks are being managed.Mr Carrel says: “If I am in a bank where the board asks what our commitments and liabilities are and what’s going to happen to us, I need to have the answer.”Marco Strimer, chief executive of SIX X-Clear, a Swiss clearer, says getting that answer right will involve an element of “common sense and gut feel”.“Sometimes people were a bit shy about saying ‘no’ [to getting involved in complex financial instruments]. I think the word ‘no’ will take on a new relevance,” he says.…..Future launchA new US futures exchange backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names took a step closer to launching on Tuesday by announcing a deal with the world’s largest derivatives clearing house, write Hal Weitzman in Chicago and Anuj Gangahar in New York.Electronic Liquidity Exchange – whose investors include banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Credit Suisse and electronic trading houses such as Getco and PEAK6-Breakwater – said it had struck an agreement with the Options Clearing Corporation to provide clearing and delivery services.“The focus on clearing and credit mitigation in the current market environment is so great that to partner with a clearing house with a AAA rating gives credibility to the effort we were undertaking,” said Neal Wolkoff, chief executive of the ELX and former chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange.The exchange hopes to break the dominance of the CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, over the US listed futures industry.Since its takeover of Nymex, the New York energy exchange, earlier this year, the CME controls 98 of US-listed futures.ELX plans to launch with Treasury futures contracts, one of the most successful products at the Chicago Board of Trade, which the CME bought last year. Although the exchange will not confirm its timetable, it is thought to be targeting the early part of next year to roll out its first contracts.
1004;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-12-03T22:58:49Z;Record number of companies at risk of default;;A fresh sign in the deterioration of credit market conditions emerged on Wednesday when one of the most closely watched barometers of sentiment broke through an important threshold.The Markit iTraxx Crossover index rose above 1,000 basis points for the first time since it was created in 2004, implying a record number of companies are on the verge of default because of deepening financial problems.Neil McLeish, head of European fixed income research at Morgan Stanley, said: “This shows the market is now more concerned about the impact of the deteriorating real economy and expected rise in defaults, rather than the risk of crisis in the financial sector.”The index, which measures the cost of protecting junk-grade companies against default, has risen sharply in the past month as sentiment has worsened because of gloomy numbers on the global economy and worries over whether companies will be able to refinance their debt.Indicators in the services sector in the US and Europe hit record lows on Wednesday.The index, composed of 50 mostly junk-rated companies in Europe, rose 60 basis points to highs of about 1,020bp, according to Markit, the data provider.It was trading at about 700bp, or a cost of €700,000 to insure €10m of debt annually against default over five years, on November 1. Before the credit crunch it was below 200bp.Meanwhile, the main credit default swaps indicator in the US, the Markit CDX North American Investment Grade index of 125 companies, rose to 271bp. On November 20 it traded at a record of 284bp. Japan’s iTraxx index is trading at record levels of 365bp.Some of the world’s leading investment-grade companies look in danger of default, according to CDS prices. On Wednesday, investors wanting protection in bonds of the finance arm of ArcelorMittal, the steel manufacturer, GKN, the UK technology and engineering group, and Lafarge, the French construction company, were all forced to pay a fee upfront. This implies they are in danger of default. Other investment-grade companies trading upfront include Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, and Continental, the German car parts maker.However, some strategists stressed CDS prices could be rising because of technical factors. For example, if an investor holds corporate bonds, they may hedge these positions by buying protection in CDS.
1005;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-12-03T20:03:47Z;Weak services data point to rate cut;;Expectations of a significant cut in interest rates on Thursday were fuelled by a survey showing the services sector contracted at a record pace in November – the third consecutive month for which a new low was reached.The bad news on services in Britain was mirrored in record low readings of business activity in services in the US and throughout the eurozone, underscoring the international nature of the recession. It is also in line with other surveys earlier this week for the manufacturing and construction sectors, both of which saw record lows.Private sector services account for about 50 per cent of UK gross domestic product, magnifying the significance of Wednesday’s figures to the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which will announce at noon on Thursday whether a further rate cut is needed to blunt the downturn.“Given the large size of the services industry in the UK, the message of this survey is particularly gloomy,” economists at Citi noted. “It reinforces the likelihood of a large cut in interest rates – our base case is at least 1 percentage point, with the possibility of more.”The survey, compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, and Markit, the data provider, recorded a headline reading of just more than 40 – weaker than expected and down from 42.4 last month. A reading below 50 indicates declining demand. The index registered more than 49 as recently as August.The pace of the decline in the fourth quarter made it likely that GDP was also contracting much faster than it did in the three months to September, according to Philip Shaw, economist at Investec Securities. “This morning’s service sector PMI was desperate,” he said, adding that Investec now expected a cut of at least 1 percentage point in rates on Thursday.Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said the decline was consistent with services sector output contracting at a quarterly rate of 1.2 per cent, compared with the 0.4 per cent drop seen in the third quarter.The components of the services index point to strong economic headwinds. The new business reading fell to less than 38, down from 40.8 in October and more than 47 in August. The employment component contracted for the seventh month in a row to a record low of 43.1.Cips/Markit, which launched the survey 12 years ago, said many respondents attributed the drop to a retrenchment of spending in the UK. Survey evidence suggested that clients were adopting a “wait-and-see” policy at a time of heightened economic uncertainty. The drop in activity in the services sector follows big falls in the manufacturing and construction readings and raises expectations that the Bank will take action to cut interest rates aggressively below their current 3 per cent.The pound fell sharply against the dollar and weakened towards a record low against the euro, while the yield on the 10-year gilt fell to a low of 3.39 per cent.
1006;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Building sector contracts sharply;;The construction sector suffered a further sharp contraction in November, driven largely by a fall in housebuilding activity, which fell to its lowest level on record, according to a closely-watched measure.The construction purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit for the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, fell to a survey low of 31.8 from 35.1 in October. A reading below 50 indicates demand is contracting. The housebuilding component fell to 23.2 in November from 25.4 in October and was less than half its 2007 level.The component that measures new orders – giving a view of how the sector may fare in months ahead – fell sharply after declining by a record-breaking amount the previous month. The new orders component fell from 41.2 to 31.8 in November.Howard Archer of analysts IHS Global Insight described the findings as “absolutely dire, indicating that the sector is going from very bad to even worse”.The employment component of the index registered a sharp drop to 31.2 from 40.9 in October, as companies cut back on workers at an unprecedented rate. However, the fall-off in demand for subcontractors had a silver lining. The survey found that in the past month, the availability of subcontractors rose, the quality of their work improved and rates charged to clients dropped.Matthew Sharrett, economist at Bank of America, said: “Today’s slump in the UK construction PMI followed another dire reading for the manufacturing sector on Tuesday. Leading indicators tell a story of a capitulation in demand, rapidly falling employment, and growing disinflation.”One bright spot could be found in the input prices index component, which fell for the first time in almost 10 years. That index registered 44.7, a series record low. As recently as June, the input prices component hit a survey high of 80.98, illustrating the scale of which falling demand has helped ease pressure on prices.The future business activity component posted a reading of 51.0, suggesting a degree of optimism within the industry.
1007;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Gloom deepens as output plunges rapidly;;Manufacturing fell at a record pace in November as new orders collapsed, fuelling speculation of a further cut in interest rates this week.“The shockingly weak reading increases our confidence that the [Bank of England’s monetary policy committee] will cut by 100 basis points this Thursday,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.The headline index slumped to 34.4, its lowest since the survey was launched in 1992 and sharply down on October’s figure of 40.7, according to the benchmark purchasing managers’ survey compiled by Markit/CIPS. Any figure below 50 indicates a contraction.New orders fell from 37.0 to a record low of 29.7, implying next month’s data may be weaker still. Output, employment and the backlog of work also hit new lows.“This unparalleled blow is further heightened as the [purchasing managers’ index] readings have collapsed to new lows for three consecutive months now,” said Roy Ayliffe, director of professional practice at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply.Purchasing managers told the survey they were leaving no stone unturned as the downturn ate into all areas of capital, consumer and intermediate goods, Mr Ayliffe said.“What’s more, it’s clear that the UK isn’t suffering alone, as the more favourable sterling failed to encourage demand from foreign clients – especially those based in the US, mainland Europe and east Asia.”The severity of the decline equates to a contraction in manufacturing output of a staggering 9 per cent in the three months to the end of November compared with the previous quarter, according to Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan. In previous recessions, he said, contractions of 5 to 6 per cent were more typical.Companies reported that the onset of the global economic downturn, credit restrictions and the crises in the auto, construction, consumer and financial sectors were leading many clients to cancel orders, according to Markit/CIPS.The seasonally adjusted employment index for November was 35.7, its eighth month below the no-change 50 level, suggesting more job losses to come.The one bright spot in the PMI numbers came from the first drop in raw material costs since July 2005. Although the data should give comfort to central bankers that they can slash interest rates without igniting inflationary pressures, they nevertheless show the slump in global aggregate demand.“Though there were some gasps of relief as the cost of key commodities slumped for the first time in over 6½ years, even this was another echo of dwindling global demand,” Mr Ayliffe said.
1008;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-11-27T16:35:43Z;UK dividends;;"It used to be a brave chief executive who tangled with coupon clippers. UK investors, more than their European or US counterparts, are exquisitely attuned to the economic and symbolic importance of the payout. This is unsurprising, given that dividends have accounted for 37 per cent of annualised total returns, according to Citigroup. But the stigma of a dividend cut now looks like yet another quaint anachronism.DSG International, the electricals retailer, on Thursday became the latest to scrap its dividend. It will be in good company. About a quarter of the FTSE 100 could cut their dividends over this year and next, according to Markit, the data provider. Some believe payouts could fall by 10-20 per cent, far worse than the 1990s recession. Companies that need to chop will probably find their investors are too shocked by the market collapse to voice the usual outrage.Even so, it is worth probing each dividend decision. The overall figures are skewed by the banks, which typically account for about 30 per cent of UK dividends. That still leaves quite a few companies entering recession with reasonably healthy balance sheets. The payout ratio, at about 40 per cent of earnings, is relatively low. It needs to be, obviously, if earnings are set to collapse, but that is still quite a cushion. Meanwhile, companies with big capital expenditure or research and development projects could elect to trim back, especially if the market is declining to reward them for the future growth from these investments.Of course, investors understand that some companies’ room for manoeuvre has been reduced to a choke-hold. If the debt markets are closed and asset sales impossible to clinch, reducing payouts can provide breathing room. But it does not necessarily improve flexibility over the longer term: a slashed dividend will not help a company’s case when and if it tries to raise capital from shareholders further down the road.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

1009;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-11-14T19:20:03Z;Eurozone enters first recession;;The eurozone has fallen into its first recession, official figures showed on Friday. The decline came even before the global financial market crisis worsened in October, adding to fears of worse to come.Gross domestic product in the 15-country region contracted by 0.2 per cent in the three months to September after a similar drop in the previous quarter. Italy joined Germany and Ireland in reporting that it was in technical recession, defined as two quarters of declining GDP.Since the end of the third quarter, eurozone economic activity is thought to have plummeted further as a result of the shockwaves from the Lehman Brothers failure in mid-September, especially on the corporate sector.Last month’s industrial production was almost 5 per cent lower than a year before – the sharpest annual decline since 1993, said Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, which produces purchasing mangers’ indices for the region. “October was quite a disastrous month all round,” he said, predicting that fourth quarter eurozone GDP would fall by at least 0.3 per cent.Underlining the scale of the global turmoil on Europe’s biggest economies, it emerged that General Motors’ Adam Opel unit was seeking loan guarantees from the German federal government and four states where it has plants to protect its business from its US parent’s worsening finances.The European Central Bank is expected to cut its main interest rate again next month from 3.25 per cent, after already cutting by half a percentage point twice in a month. Marco Annunziata, chief economist at Unicredit, said the eurozone was in recession in July when the ECB raised rates to a seven-year high of 4.25 per cent.“We now have painful proof that there has been an excessive degree of complacency, which implies the policy response in Europe is well behind the curve,” Mr Annunziata said.France offered some brighter news, saying it had escaped recession after a 0.1 per cent rise in GDP in the third quarter, following a 0.3 per cent contraction in the previous three months. Growth was supported by consumer spending.Eurozone growth has been hit by high energy and official borrowing costs, a strong currency, the effects of the financial market crisis and falling global growth prospects.
1010;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-11-13T19:39:48Z;Ditched asset plan casts shadow over credit;US move could trigger forced sales and losses;The Treasury’s ditched effort to prop up mortgage-backed assets is casting a new shadow over the credit ­markets and could trigger another wave of forced selling and losses.Although the credit crisis has spread far beyond the original problems caused by higher-than-expected losses on debt backed by risky mortgages, the continued dysfunction and illiquidity in the $11,000bn mortgage-backed market still hangs over the financial sector.Investors such as banks and hedge funds are having difficulty trading even the simplest and highest-quality of these securities – one of the reasons the Treasury decided to set up a plan to start buying these distressed assets in September in the hope that this could restore liquidity to the frozen credit markets.There are also large quantities of highly complex securities backed by mortgages, such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which continue to plunge in value and are also almost impossible to sell. The loss of a buyer of last resort in the form of the US government through its $700bn Troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) has removed a prop from the sector.“I expect many investors will have to take a hard, hard look at their valuations of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs without the Treasury around to buy them,” says Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics.Prices on mortgage-backed securities that are not owned or guaranteed by the government mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell sharply after the US Treasury confirmed on Wednesday that it was no longer planning to buy toxic mortgage assets.The asset purchases were the original centrepiece of the department’s plan to ease the crisis.Residential and commercial mortgage-backed bonds all fell. All the ABX indices tied to subprime mortgage bonds reached new lows, according to Markit, which operates the indices. On Wednesday, warning signs were flashing that the losses such price declines would generate could feed through to another bout of weakness in credit markets as a key bank lending rate rose for the first time in more than a month. The three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) broke a run of declines as investors worried that banks will have to raise more money to shore up balance sheets as the value of mortgage-backed assets falls.Ted Wieseman, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the declines in the ABX could raise “the possibility of yet another round of significant mark-to-market writedowns by banks in the fourth quarter if current trends are ­sustained”.The Treasury’s changed stance augurs renewed volatility as traders alter tack at a time when liquidity is stretched by the proximity of year end, a period when investors and banks close their books. Hedge funds face a wave of redemption requests, which is pushing them to sell assets into weak markets.“People have been caught off-guard as they were assured that Tarp would buy mortgages and expected Libor would keep coming down,” said Rick Klingman, managing director at BNP Paribas.The mortgage market’s troubles have fed through to the credit markets. Hank Paulson, US Treasury Secretary, highlighted on Wednesday that the asset-backed markets – covering bonds backed by credit card receivables, auto loans and student loans – “has for all practical purposes ground to a halt”. He said the Tarp would focus on these markets but details remain extremely limited.“Securitisation has been such an essential source of funding for the entire economy that the consequences of its breakdown are potentially so large it is still hard to quantify,” said Greg Peters, head of US credit strategy at Morgan Stanley.There are expectations that the Treasury may have to step in to prop up the mortgage-backed markets, especially as foreign investors continue to sell their US holdings. “Buying by the Treasury is required longer-term to offset the imbalance created due to the lack of support from foreign investors,” noted analysts at Credit Suisse.Analysis: Into the storm
1011;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
1012;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-11-05T20:24:56Z;Upheaval takes its toll on corporate debt;;Credit derivatives have long been held up by their proponents as the most efficient and reliable way to trade corporate debt exposure, especially through the credit and banking crises that have sucked liquidity from many markets.But in recent weeks the differences between what credit derivative and cash bond markets seem to be saying about the risk of corporate debt have become so stark that analysts and investors are increasingly unsure about which market to trust.Since the turmoil of late September and October sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, spreads, or risk premiums, have increased dramatically in both markets. However, cash spreads saw the greater leap with those on the iBoxx index of corporate bonds, for example, more than doubling from about 184 basis points on September 15, to a peak of more than 381bp on October 31. The iTraxx Europe index of investment grade credit derivatives, meanwhile, went from 105bp to 157bp over the same period, according to data from Markit Group.These moves have brought a big increase in the difference, or basis, between the two markets. According to JPMorgan analysts, at the extremes the negative basis, as it is known, between the bonds and credit default swaps of some individual companies has been as large as 600bp-800bp.Such a large difference suggests that the two markets have dramatically different perceptions about the value of corporate debt or about the risks of default, either that or one of them is much more full of noise.“When you think about what have been and what remain the principal challenges for credit markets – funding, deleveraging, liquidation etc – it’s the cash market which is at the coal face,” says Steve Dulake at JPMorgan.“While we think there’s arguably too much noise to justify looking at CDS on a standalone basis, there’s certainly a whole lotta signal from the disconnect between cash and CDS.” This disconnect, he says, is down to a significant difference between liquid and illiquid markets.Cash bonds are suffering precisely because they are cash – investors need to be able to fund their investments in real bonds.Hans Peter, Lorenzen at Citigroup, agrees that cash bonds are being punished more due to liquidity but thinks that CDS spreads show something useful.“The CDS spread is the best indicator of default risk, as current bond spreads also reflect funding and liquidity issues in the market, which means they overstate implied default risk,” he says.Jim Reid, at Deutsche Bank, thinks investors could be facing “the decade of credit” – with cash corporate bonds and loans representing “the best long term risk-reward investment”.After studying returns in US corporate bonds, Treasuries, equities, oil and property over the past 109 years, with cash credit spreads at 100-year wides, it is the one asset classes with the most to gain. “Double-digit annual returns are a realistic possibility over the medium term even as defaults pick up,” he says.
1013;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-11-04T22:49:38Z;Construction sector malaise intensifies;;The crisis in the construction industry shows no sign of abating, according to a survey pointing to the sector shrinking at the fastest rate in more than a decade.The construction purchasing managers’ index, compiled by Markit for the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, shows activity fell for the eighth consecutive month in October, with housebuilding slowing for the 11th month in a row.The intensity of the decline also deepened. The leading index, a measure of activity throughout the UK construction sector, fell from 38.8 in September to 35.1, its lowest since the series began in 1997 and far below a reading of 50 that marks contraction.Figures next week from PwC, the professional services group, are expected to show insolvencies in the UK construction sector also increased in the third quarter, with 537 businesses going bust. The figure would be up nearly a fifth compared with the previous period, and by more than 46 per cent year-on-year.Magellan Residential, a small Yorkshire-based housebuilder, on Tuesday announced it had been placed into administration. Dan Butters of Deloitte, one of the administrators, blamed “continued pressures facing the UK housebuilding sector” for the move.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, described the CIPS data as “absolutely dire”.“The construction sector is already firmly in recession,” he said, pointing to national accounts data showing a 0.8 per cent year-on-year fall in the third quarter following a 0.5 per cent fall in the previous period.Both employment and new orders fell at record rates, implying the sector is readying itself for a protracted downturn. Only input cost inflation rose in October, albeit at the lowest perceived level since 2005 as commodity prices slipped.“With no recovery in sight, constructors gave their first-ever pessimistic prognosis on future sector performance in the history of the survey,” noted Roy Ayliffe, director of professional practice at CIPS. “Though housebuilding continued to bear the brunt of the global crisis, commercial activity is also feeling the pinch,” he added.Paradoxically, the figures gave a boost to shares throughout the sector as the bad news further increased the chances of a hefty cut in interest rates by the Bank of England tomorrow.The rally was led by Taylor Wimpey, which closed up 2¼p at 16p. Balfour Beatty jumped 9 per cent after a straightforward trading update reiterated its cash- positive position.
1014;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-28T19:21:24Z;Sale of single $4.5bn portfolio;;The extent of the deleveraging in global credit markets was illustrated on Tuesday by the size of a single portfolio being liquidated in the markets, which included $1.5bn worth of global corporate bonds and $3bn in credit derivatives.Barclays Bank was auctioning the portfolio, according to a number of people familiar with the request for bids, and it was widely believed in the market to be a package of so-called basis trades from a single owner.One person familiar with the auction said Barclays was selling the portfolio on behalf of a US-based client.Credit derivatives markets have been hammered under the weight of sales by leveraged investors and a worsening economic outlook in recent days, but showed much improved sentiment along with equity markets on Tuesday in spite of the large portfolio auction, first reported by S&P LCD, a market information service.The cost of protecting European investment grade debt against default on the main iTraxx index fell on Tuesday by almost €4,000 to €167,580 annually for €10m ($12.5m) worth of bonds over five years, according to data from Markit Group, as the index spread dropped 3.98 basis points to 167.58bp. The US CDX investment grade index was also better, down 2bp to 223bp.The auction included bonds from, and derivatives on, a range of US, European and UK companies, both investment grade and high yield. The auction was being conducted in Asia, the US and Europe.In October alone, some $3.3bn in loans and $1.54bn in bonds have been put on the block, according to S&P LCD. However, one senior London-based credit trader said that other portfolios of credit derivatives of the size being auctioned by Barclays had also been sold recently.Basis trades involve buying corporate bonds and then also buying protection against default in the credit default swap market. CDS protection costs naturally tend to be less than corporate bond yields because there is an extra cost of funding involved in buying a bond whereas a derivative is unfunded.Basis trades are profitable when the difference between a CDS cost and a bond yield is greater than the owner’s cost of funds.However, CDS spreads have recently increased dramatically. At the same time, according to one London-based analyst, a number of bank proprietary trading desks appear to have been funded by their bank’s treasury at remarkably cheap levels, meaning that their profits on such trades might not have been as healthy as they appeared.Loans markets have been hit hard by a wave of sales as investors who borrow money to buy the debt, such as hedge funds, have seen the value of their positions crumble.Barclays declined to comment on the auction.
1015;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-24T17:37:15Z;Survey underlines grim outlook for eurozone;;The eurozone economy contracted sharply in October as the global bank crisis slammed the brakes on business activity and blackened the outlook for the 15-country region, a closely watched survey indicated on Friday.The steep fall in eurozone purchasing managers’ indices, which showed private-sector output falling at the fastest rate since the launch of the euro in 1999, suggested the region was facing prolonged recession-like conditions, which could last well into next year.But economists warned that the full effects of tighter credit conditions on business and consumers may have yet to feed through, and that expected cuts in European Central Bank interest rates could fail to revive growth.The “composite” purchasing managers’ index, covering manufacturing and services, slumped from 46.9 in September to 44.6 in October, the lowest since the survey began a decade ago.“The financial crisis has developed rapidly into an economic crisis, with the eurozone economy contracting at the fastest rate for over 10 years,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the research company that produces the survey. The indices are regarded as offering a good guide to trends in economic activity, providing a more up-to-date snapshot of activity than gross domestic product data. An index figure below 50 is taken to indicate a contraction in activity.They showed eurozone manufacturers’ new orders fell this month at the sharpest rate ever recorded, led by a slump in export orders. Service sector new business did not contract as fast but still saw the second steepest fall on record. Eurozone employment has fallen for four consecutive months.The scale of the deterioration suggested several factors had combined into a lethal economic cocktail. Eurozone growth started to slow last year as a result of a stronger euro, higher official borrowing costs and then surging oil and commodity prices. “What I fear at the moment is that you have a natural progression from the downturn that was already in place with the extra hit from the financial market crisis …It has exacerbated problems that were already there,” said Mr Williamson.Eurozone GDP fell by 0.2 per cent in the three months to June. Recent months’ purchasing managers’ indices have been consistent with a contraction in eurozone economic growth in the third quarter that is gathering pace in the final months of the year, with more gloom to come at the start of 2009.“I can’t see anything in this data to suggest that things have bottomed out,” Mr Williamson said.The real economic impact of the intensification of the financial market crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers remains unclear. Eurozone corporate borrowing figures have shown little evidence of a “credit crunch” – but data for September and this month have not yet been released.Dirk Schumacher, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, argued that the latest drop in the purchasing managers’ indices reflected falling demand, including for eurozone exports, as well as the psychological impact of the recent financial market turmoil. The impact of the most recent squeeze on credit was “still to come”.A revival in bank lending and confidence in coming weeks may help alleviate pressures. At the same time, eurozone inflation prospects have been transformed – as confirmed by the purchasing managers’ survey. Input and output price inflation both eased sharply in October, with discounting in the face of falling demand.The improved inflation outlook has fuelled speculation that the ECB will cut its main interest rate by another half a percentage point at its November 6 interest-rate setting meeting.
1016;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;First internet access for sovereign CDS;;"Government credit default swaps are to be published on the internet for the first time, in a sign of the increasing importance of these instruments as the economic and financial crisis deepens.Only a few months ago, the cost of insuring government debt was rarely focused on by investors because most countries were considered stable. This was reflected in their relatively steady CDS prices, which provided little opportunity to make money.But since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last month and the decision of governments to guarantee financial debt, this has changed. Even the biggest and richest economies, such as the US and UK, have seen sharp swings in their cost of protection.Markit, the data provider, will provide the prices on its website in the next week, together with the prices of the main CDS indices that track the credit risk of companies in Europe, the US and Asia, which are already published.Suki Mann, credit strategist at SG CIB, said: “Sovereign credit default swaps have become sexier as the economic health of governments and their economies has become the story. They are much livelier now than they were only a few months ago. More investors are looking at them.”The CDS prices of the emerging market nations have seen the most dramatic movements of late.Argentina, for example, saw its CDS price jump to 4,000 basis points – the highest sovereign spread in the world – on Thursday. This means it costs $4m to insure $10m of Argentine debt over five years. It has jumped nearly 1,000bp this week. Other big movers include Russia, which has jumped to 1,000bp; Ukraine, trading at a record 2,800bp; and Pakistan, which saw prices rise to 3,000bp at one point on Thursday.These countries are all suffering from the dramatic rise in risk aversion and deepening fears over the severity of the global slowdown.Credit default swaps have grown dramatically in the past five years with the market now valued at $54,000bn in outstanding contracts."
1017;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-23T19:57:21Z;CSC draws on $1.5bn credit facility;;Computer Sciences Corporation, manager of IT networks for Nasa and the US Navy, has drawn down a $1.5bn credit facility to refinance debt because of continued instability in the credit markets.The move highlights companies’ continued restricted access to credit markets in spite of efforts by central banks globally to ease the financial crisis.CSC borrowed the full amount available under a revolving credit facility to refinance short-term debt, known as commercial paper, blaming “the current instability of the commercial paper market”.“The action will ensure the company’s liquidity position in light of the ongoing credit market dislocation,” the company said.The move comes in spite of plans announced this month by the Federal Reserve to buy commercial paper in an effort to thaw credit markets and reduce borrowing costs that threatened to stymie companies.A Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) will fund purchases of highly rated, US-dollar denominated, three-month, unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper issued by US issuers, from October 27.Concerns that the credit crisis would freeze out even highly rated companies from the $1,600bn market for short-term debt have forced bellwethers such as General Electric, the biggest issuer of commercial paper, and US grocer Kroger to seek out alternative funding sources.“The US government announced measures earlier this month aimed at restoring confidence in the CP market,” said analysts at data provider Markit. “However, CSC is a strong BBB credit and its actions today suggest it could be some time before normality returns.”CSC has about 90,000 employees and reported revenue of $17.1bn for the 12 months ended July 4 2008.
1018;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Insight: Realm of fantasy in credit insurance;;If you had a £100,000 car, what kind of world would it be where you’d consider paying 50 grand over five years to insure it?You’d either have to be such an appalling driver that you ought not to be on the road, or the world would be such a lawless and dangerous place that your £100,000 car should be among the least of your worries.We do not need the details of mathematical probabilities to see there is little sense in the idea of paying out insurance costs that are a huge chunk of the value of the thing to be insured. But that is exactly what participants in credit markets are being asked to do.Banks were for weeks the focus of fears before the series of government bail-out plans. Many institutions saw their credit default swaps – originally created to provide for lenders insurance against a borrower’s bankruptcy – trade at levels previously unimaginable.But the short-lived relief that came from the bail-outs has passed and a new black mood has descended over credit.For example, on Thursday the European index of mostly junk-rated companies – the iTraxx Crossover – burst through the 800 basis point mark for the first time, according to Markit Group. This means annual “insurance” premiums of 8 per cent of the value of the debt insured, or payments totalling 40 per cent over the life of the five-year contract. So, to protect €10m worth of investments in the bonds in the index, the market is charging €4m in total.For some individual investment-grade companies, the figures are just as stark. Take Lafarge, the French cement group, whose CDS on Thursday put the cost of insuring €10m of its bonds at almost €550,000 per year, or €2.75m in total. And before the US bank bail-out, Morgan Stanley was among the most distressed credits anywhere, according to CDS markets. To insure its bonds, buyers of protection often had to pay 20 per cent or more of their value upfront just to get a contract signed, plus another 0.5 per cent, annually. A total pay-out in other words of about $4.5m to cover $10m in bonds.Whatever your view on how close Morgan Stanley came to death’s door, these numbers are fantastic. Even given that the vast majority of traders in CDS do not actually own any of the bonds they are “insuring”, the premiums are still huge next to the maximum potential pay-outs if triggered, which is equivalent to the value of bonds “insured”. So what is going on?The markets are utterly divorced from fundamental value or risks of defaults. This in a way is nothing new. Before the crunch, they were similarly split from reality, just in the opposite direction. But in those days, there was an entire industry devoted to selling protection at ever lower premiums and turning those into decent investor returns through the leverage and alchemy of collateralised debt obligations. Who now is buying protection at these ever higher levels?There are a number of direct and indirect answers. First, the markets for the real bonds is bunged up – as with many markets there is a lack of cash demand and a fear of forced sales and new supply. The only place to trade – or to offload risk – is in CDSs.Second, with bank funding tight and capital under pressure, one of the only ways to keep corporate clients in funding is for banks to pass on risk through derivatives. My colleague Anousha Sakoui wrote this week about Nokia’s banks pricing a new loan off its CDSs.Thirdly, the fears about liquidity and counterparty risk recently applied to banks are now affecting a wide range of companies. This makes CDS protection interesting to people concerned about different risks, for example trade receivables or supply-chain finance.Ultimately, the biggest problem is that afflicting all markets: the flight from risk. And there is a reason to fear a big lurch into darker territory in the CDS market: investors in the CDOs that once drove the market tighter have yet to turn tail and flee. Until September, it was easier to argue that CDOs that were under water in market value terms would still pay out in full. Since Lehman and others defaulted, this argument has become much harder to make. A significant CDO unwind would see this industry reverse its previous role – and push the market into more fantastic realms.
1019;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-23T18:10:59Z;Recession and debt fears spur sell-off;;Fears in credit markets over debt defaults intensified on Thursday, surpassing those seen in the turmoil surrounding the collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns.Rising worries over a global recession, the unwinding of trades made by hedge funds with borrowed money and instability in emerging economies combined to trigger forced selling in loan, bond and credit derivatives markets.The sell-off came amid a broad flight from risk that is hitting equity markets worldwide and sending measures of market volatiliy to elevated levels.“The repricing of risk has been nothing short of savage, highlighting how the excessive liquidity conditions in the 2003-2007 era were underwriting risk assets and the withdrawal of the liquidity may now leave a mark on credit for years to come,” said Suki Mann, strategist at SG CIB.Debt markets are under added pressure from an expected wave of corporate debt sales as borrowing from banks becomes increasingly difficult.The main iTraxx index of European investment grade debt, which includes a lot of banks, for the first time breached the records set at the time of Bear Stearns’ rescue. Spreads rose to 166.88 basis points, according to Markit Group, although they closed slightly better at 161.25bp.The iTraxx Crossover list of mostly junk-rated names – a barometer of risk appetite in credit – hit 800bp for the first time ever. It closed 23.25bp higher at 820.5bp. US and Asia indices also set new records.The impact of recession fears could be seen in the kind of groups suffering, with industrials, resources and energy – particularly those with big emerging market operations – hit hardest. Lafarge, Thyssen Krupp, Repsol and Enel were big movers.Emerging markets have been casualties. Stocks, bonds and currencies of countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Argentina and Pakistan have been hit this week amid growing risk aversion and fears over the global slowdown.The investor redemption demands and unwinding of positions at hedge funds has led to assets being dumped on to the market. This has had a negative knock-on effect on bond prices, which is starting to spread to equity markets.“The current repricing is being driven by technicals, but as you begin to weigh up the relative value, you realise markets are not completely insulated from each other,” said Matt King, Credit Strategist at Citi.
1020;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-19T21:38:26Z;Nervous times for investors in loan markets;;Investors in European and US loan markets will enter their offices with great trepidation on Monday morning after a flood of forced selling by hedge funds and other leveraged investors sent prices crashing last week.In Europe, the average price of the most commonly traded large leveraged loans to companies such as Alliance Boots, Ineos, NTL and United Biscuits saw its biggest weekly drop, according to S&P LCD, the market information service, and Markit Group.The US market for such debt, which is mainly used for private equity buy-out deals, has also suffered big falls in recent weeks as hedge funds and other market value sensitive investors have become forced sellers.Analysts do not expect the picture to improve in the near term because falling prices for loans and other risky assets lead banks to force hedge funds and other investors who use borrowed money to put up more cash in so-called margin calls or sell holdings. Investors in such funds are increasingly asking for their money back as concern spreads about the state of credit markets. US hedge funds had to hand back $43bn in September according to TrimTabs Investment Research.“A vicious circle of redemptions, margin calls and further redemptions can only make us nervous on [loan and credit] spreads in the short run,” said Peter Goves, Citigroup strategist. “While funds in equities probably have plenty of cash on hand at this point to cope with redemptions, in credit we are not so sure.” He added that a normalisation in loan and credit markets was only possible once so-called real money – or non-leveraged – investors saw value in such stressed prices no matter how bad the economic outlook.The US loan market saw its worst losses nearer the start of October, when the price of loans to companies such as Celanese and Charter Communications dropped from more than 90 cents in the dollar to the low 80s and the high 70s respectively in a matter of days. Loans to Ford Motor have dropped from 65 cents to 42 cents this month, according to data from Markit.Investors put out requests for bids on portfolios of loans worth $2.28bn this month alone, according to S&P LCD, which compares with a total of $471m for all of the third quarter.In Europe, the average price dropped 7.2 cents in the euro to 73.32 cents according to S&P LCD, more than double the previous week’s decline and the biggest weekly drop yet seen.
1021;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-14T21:07:38Z;Overview: Bank bail-out novelty wears off;;Equity markets in Europe and Asia rose while Wall Street slipped lower on Tuesday as investors focused on the outlook for the economy and earnings as the US government moved to inject about $250bn of public money into the banking system.Wall Street initially reacted positively to the news but struggled to sustain upward momentum after surging 11.6 per cent on Monday, the largest one-day gain since the 1930s. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent.The US decision to inject capital directly into nine of the country’s biggest banks in exchange for equity stakes is a departure from the rescue scheme approved by Congress earlier this month. It follows the lead set by governments in the UK and Europe which also announced radical plans to use public money to support their banking systems on Monday.Spreads on credit default swaps for US financial companies tightened sharply. Morgan Stanley’s cost of protection tumbled to 385 basis points having hit a peak last week of about 1,420bp, according to Markit Group. In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland was down to 75bp from a peak of of 315bp a fortnight ago.European credit markets also saw spreads on credit default swaps for financials outperform the main investment grade iTraxx Europe index which tightened 11bp to 124bp.Mislav Matejka, European equity strategist at JPMorgan, said the credit market rather than equities would be key in assessing whether government and central bank measures worked.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics said the US government’s move was “fantastic news” but warned that it would not prevent the economy from sliding into “a deep and prolonged recession.”In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 3.1 per cent while London’s FTSE 100 added 3.2 per cent, taking their gains over the last two days to 13.5 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively.“Equity markets are expressing confidence that government interventions will successfully address the core problems of the financial turmoil. Undoubtedly, however, the crisis has arrived in the real economy and both consumers and companies alike will carefully reassess their discretionary spending,” said Gunnar Hamann at Dresdner Kleinwort.Germany’s ZEW survey showed investors’ expectations for the economy deteriorating with the index dropping from -41.1 in September to -63.0 in October, close to July’s record low.In Asia, Japan’s stock market took inspiration from Monday’s surge on Wall Street and posted a record one-day rise on Tuesday with the Nikkei 225 vaulting 14.2 per cent, helped by strong gains for banking stocks. The exchange was closed on Monday.Japan’s government is also considering the possibility of injecting capital into regional institutions to support financing for smaller companies. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index extended Monday’s strong gains and rose 3.2 per cent.Australia’s stock market and currency responded positively to news of a A$10.4bn ($7.3bn) stimulus package, which included cash for pensioners and larger grants to first time-home buyers, with the ASX 200 index rising by 3.7 per cent.Money markets showed further tentative signs of thawing with overnight to three-month dollar, sterling and euro Libor rates falling. Three-month euro Libor fell just over 7 basis points to 5.22500, its largest one day decline this year. Three-month sterling Libor inched 2bp lower to 6.24875 per cent while three-month dollar Libor dropped almost 12bp to 4.63500.Don Smith, economist at Icap, said sentiment in money markets had improved but lending conditions remained “extremely thin”.The US government bond market returned for business after Monday’s holiday with yields on two-year Treasuries rising 23 basis points to 1.83 per cent while the benchmark ten-year bond yield rose 21bp to 4.07 per cent. Traders said the sell-off at the short end showed some of the recent flight to safety was being unwound. In the UK, yields on ten-year Gilts rose 8bp to 4.739 per cent while 10-year Bund yields were up 4bp at 4.112 per cent.
1022;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-14T00:46:59Z;Cost concerns over guaranteed debt remain;;Debt markets warmly welcomed the government’s credit guarantee scheme on Monday as the best bit of news heard on a Monday morning in weeks, but bankers and analysts said questions remained unanswered.The biggest questions concern what kind of investors will purchase government guaranteed bank debt and how steep the cost of using the scheme will prove.“The UK government actions have obviously been constructive and have ac­com­plished quite a bit in terms of improving sentiment, but there is a lot here for potential investors to di­gest,” said one debt banker.That sentiment was reflected in credit markets, where the cost of protecting UK bank debt against default tumbled. Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Barclays were leading performers in European credit derivatives on Monday, even as shares of the first two fell.The banks have seen the costs on their credit default swaps (CDS) drop by about half since the details of the plan to strengthen capital bases – and so protect creditors against losses – became clearer last week.But the extremely elevated levels bank CDS have reached in recent weeks will influence the cost of a government guarantee. The fees for its stamp of approval will be each banks’ median CDS spread in the year to October 7, plus 50 basis points.For RBS and Barclays this would mean fees of roughly 130bp-140bp, according to Markit Group, on top of whatever returns investors demand. A year ago both banks’ CDS, which norm­ally act as a proxy for returns demanded by investors, traded at just 25bp-30bp.With a government guarantee, it is hoped demand ought to come from pension funds, insurers and others who buy UK gilts. But it is far from clear they would be interested in £250bn or more of guaranteed bank debt, bankers said. The same investors are already being asked to digest a big increase in gilt issuance.Moyeen Islam of Barclays Capital said the £37bn ($64.5bn) the government needs to raise to buy bank shares represents a doubling of expected gilt issuance for the remainder of the year – and that is before an extra £10bn-£15bn needed in light of the slowing economy.However, bonds issued under the guarantee, which will all be new debt, will be eligible for Bank of England liquidity programmes, inc­luding the Special Liquidity Scheme, which runs over a similar period to the guarantee. The fee to use the new bonds would be 3 per cent of their value – substantially less than the 12 per cent fee on the mortgage-backed bonds and similar debt banks can use currently.Alongside top-ranking unsecured bank bonds, the guarantee can be used for short-term commercial paper and certificates of deposit in sterling, euro or US dollars, the statement from the Debt Management Office said.UK banks rely on foreign currency investors for much of their funding, but for the government to give a guarantee to euro or dollar issues could mean their bearing the risk of currency changes as well as that of bank default.

In the US, retailers were among the worst performing credits.However, it was the non-investment grade indices that saw the worst selling as the flight from risk that was apparent in the stock markets drove the cost of protection for junk-rated debt to new highs.Analysts said hedge fund and bank deleveraging as a result of the failures in Iceland and the still highly stressed money markets were behind the flight from risk.“We fear that the unwind has further to run and remain underweight on credit,” said Willem Sels, credit strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort. “Money markets remain key for confidence as well as fundamentals, and they are not reacting to the most recent central bank and government initiatives.”Libor rates, which govern the costs in the interbank lending market, were mixed with the dollar overnight rate dropping sharply by 2.625 percentage points to 2.46875 per cent. Most other rates were higher or nearly flat.The iTraxx main investment grade index was 7.3 wider at 139.7bp while the CDX investment grade was 25bp wider at 223.2bp, according to Markit Group. The iTraxx Crossover of junk rated debt was about 51.6bp wider at 729bp which was improved from being 67.5bp wider in the morning.

The iTraxx Crossover of junk rated debt was about 51.6bp wider at 729bp which was improved from being 67.5bp wider in the morning.Leveraged loan spreads and their derivatives were also under great strain. “The failure of the Icelandic banks has prompted the forced selling of leveraged loans, which was a key factor in the slump in the LevX index,” said Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank. Spreads had been pushed so high that implied default rate for the LevX index is now about 87 per cent with an assumed recovery of 70 per cent and about 64 per cent with an assumed 50 per cent recovery, he added.In the US investment grade space, Macy’s was about 52bp wider to 409bp; JC Penney’s are about 42bp wider to 470bp; and Limited is 41bp wider to 426bp.In Europe, banks recovered a good deal of ground late in the day, but insurers were hit harder as they had been at the the start of the week, suggesting the market has moved its focus to the next vulnerable target industry where capital is under pressure."
1025;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ICE joins banks for global clearing solution;;"Some of Wall Street’s biggest names sought to regain the initiative in the battle for control of the $54,000bn credit derivatives market on Friday by teaming up with InterContinental Exchange, the electronic futures exchange, to create a trading and central clearing counterparty (CCP) platform for credit default swaps.The Clearing Corporation – a Chicago-based clearing house backed by big users of credit derivatives, such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America – said it would join ICE to create a “global clearing solution” for CDSs.Others involved are Creditex and T Zero, subsidiaries of ICE that handle post-trade processing for CDSs, Markit Group, a provider of credit derivatives pricing systems and Risk Metrics, a risk management specialist. A subsidiary of ICE, ICE Trust, would function as a “global clearing house and central counterparty for CDS transactions”.The move comes in response to this week’s announcement by the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Citadel, the hedge fund, that they would join forces on a similar venture to begin operations within 30 days.It will raise questions about the CME’s ability to attract liquidity. “It will be challenging for any competing group [including the CME/Citadel venture] to gain significant traction in electronic trading or clearing of credit derivatives after today’s group of signed letters of intent,” wrote Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe Bruyette and Woods.The futures industry is marked by tension between the CME – which controls 98 per cent of listed derivatives in the US – and the big banks and dealers, which are loathe to cede more power to the exchange by allowing it to establish itself as a force in the CDS market.The banks have a natural partner in ICE, which last year launched a bidding war for the Chicago Board of Trade, which was eventually won by the CME.Since the CME purchased Nymex, the New York energy exchange, in August, it also competes with ICE in clearing over-the-counter energy contracts. ICE first signalled its intention to move into CDSs in June, when it paid $625m for
Creditex.The absence of a CCP, and thus of an entity that guarantees pay-outs in the event of any party’s inability to do so, has exposed the risk of massive market disruption.Banks and exchanges are under pressure from regulators to create a CCP for the opaque contracts as soon as possible. The New York Federal Reserve was due yesterday to hold a second meeting on the issue with the CME and Citadel, ICE and the TCC, and NYSE Euronext, as well as with dealers, buyside firms, US regulators and the European Central Bank.“The Federal Reserve does not endorse any of these specific proposals but is seeking to accelerate market adoption of central counterparty services,” the New York Fed said."
1026;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit move on identification;;Markit Group plans to push the global loan markets towards more efficient and transparent trading with the creation of an identification system that will eventually enable full electronic processing.The industry-owned data provider and processing company said that the initiative, which will provide individual loan identifiers and a numbering system for loan market participants, would see a first stage completed by the end of the year.The initiative is aimed at heading off the kind of settlement and deal-tracking problems that have been seen in markets such as that for credit derivatives, by modernising processes before problems arise.Financial information in loan markets is still currently transmitted mostly by fax, e-mail or phone, resulting in operational inefficiency and high error rates, the company said.“Markit’s new universal set of identifiers for the syndicated loan market will improve accuracy and operational efficiency by ensuring that information transmitted is linked to the correct underlying loan and delivered to the right market participant,” it added.
1027;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-06T23:20:36Z;Fed to hold CDS clearance talks;;Banks are hoarding cash in expectation of pay-outs on up to $400bn of defaulted credit derivatives linked to Lehman Brothers and other institutions, according to analysts and ­dealers.This added pressure on the frozen financial system comes as authorities prepare to meet participants in the so-far unregulated $54,000bn credit derivatives market to speed up plans for the creation of a central clearing house.The Federal Reserve will meet dealers, investors and exchange executives in New York on Tuesday. Although big dealers had committed to setting up a central counterparty by the end of the year, urgency has increased in light of the collapse of banks around the world and as company bankruptcies loom.“The New York Fed will hold a meeting Tuesday with a small number of banks and buyside firms to discuss the progress being made toward the creation of a central counterparty for credit default swaps,” said a Fed official, adding that this would “help reduce systemic risk associated with counterparty credit exposure and improve how the failure of a major participant would be addressed”.Credit default swaps, a form of insurance against bond defaults, are the most common type of credit derivative. On Monday, the default of up to $500bn in derivative contracts linked to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was settled, the biggest such exercise ever carried out.“We now clearly have the capacity to handle very large-scale settlements,” said Tom Price, managing director at Markit.The Fannie and Freddie CDS settled at between 91.5 and 99.9 cents on the dollar, reflecting the fact its underlying debt is not in default after the mortgage groups were seized by the US government. The seizure did trigger defaults on derivatives, however.The next test will be the unwinding of CDS linked to Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy three weeks ago. Michael Hampden-Turner, a credit strategist at Citi, estimates that there could be $400bn of credit derivatives referenced to Lehman.These contracts will be settled on Friday, and with the recovery value on Lehman bonds currently estimated at about 10 cents on the dollar, the pay-out by banks and other sellers of credit protection on Lehman could reach a gross $360bn.The Fed meeting is expected to include executives from exchanges such as the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which are vying with The Clearing Corporation, a consortium of investment banks and dealers that has vowed to establish a central counterparty clearing house by the end of the year.
1028;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-10-03T17:48:27Z;Signal for interest rate cut;;A cut in UK interest rates next week looks likely, after a closely watched survey of the crucial services sector on Friday dropped at a record rate to a new low in its 12-year history.Several economists have switched to forecasts of rate cuts when the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee meets next week, retreating from warnings that inflation was still too high to justify any rate cuts this year. Some of these economists expect an interest rate cut of up to half a percentage point next week.A Thomson Reuters poll of economists taken after the survey showed 49 out of 62 now expect rates to be lowered by at least a quarter of a percentage point after the MPC’s next meeting. In a previous poll a few days ago, only 21 out of 66 predicted a cut. The trigger for the change in outlook, economists said, was the purchasing managers’ index for the UK services sector.The drop was a sharp about-turn after a relatively strong result the previous month. The headline index, which measures overall activity in services, fell to 46.0 in September from 49.2 in August – which had been its best reading in months. The August number had raised hopes that a trough had been reached. Any figure below 50 indicates a decline.Roy Ayliffe, of the Chartered Institute for Professional Services, which compiles the index along with data provider Markit, said the drop in activity was particularly acute in the hotels and restaurants sector.“Operating conditions were marked by what are now real fears of recession as levels of employment continued to plummet as a result of dwindling demand,” Mr Ayliffe said. “Lack of client confidence drove a significant reduction in new business as the global financial crisis gathered pace.”The survey offered good news: input cost inflation eased to its lowest since Jan-uary as the lower oil price filtered through. Nonetheless, overall costs faced by services companies continued to increase sharply, reflecting higher utility, food and supplier prices.Panellists who contribute comments to the survey noted high levels of uncertainty, adding that there is little new business in company pipelines to take up the slack when existing business is completed.The number for incoming new business, one component of the headline index, fell sharply to 45.2 from 47.1 in August, with panellists commenting particularly on weakness in the construction sector and in the property market.The outstanding business component of the headline index fell to 42.1 from 44.1 in August, with particular weakness among hotels and restaurants. The employment component of the index fell for the fifth consecutive month to 47.3 from 47.9.
1029;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-25T21:02:31Z;Asset-backed bond markets finely poised;;The Merrill Lynch executives who took the decision to sell off a bunch of complex mortgage-related debt assets at about 22 cents in the dollar during the summer could have good reason to feel peeved once the US market bail-out plan is finalised.The Treasury and Federal Reserve insist that they will not risk taxpayer losses by overvaluing similar bonds to be bought up in the $700bn Troubled Asset Relief Program. But by the same token, the banking system cannot afford to sell such debt at firesale prices.Asset-backed bond markets remain finely poised as investors await the outcome of the machinations of Congress and political horse trading ahead of a deal. US and European mortgage-backed bonds and related derivatives rallied strongly when the news first came.Partly this was down to markets clawing back ground from the sell-off that had occurred in the days ahead of last Friday’s announcement, driven by the big rise in systemic risk fears. Since then performance has been mixed.Derivatives of European mortgage-backed bonds have seen spreads, or risk premiums, drift wider every day since Monday’s rally, according to analysts. In the US, the ABX indices of derivatives of triple A rated subprime bonds have seen prices turn down slightly as the week has gone on, according to data from Markit.However, US cash markets for non-agency mortgage bonds have held steady and trading has been thin as potential buyers wait for a deal to take shape.The overwhelming sentiment is that a deal will get done, but there is still huge uncertainty about what form it will take and, crucially, what will be included and how assets will be priced.“Anyone who believes that Tarp will not be approved is smoking a substance that’s illegal in most countries,” says Jim Irvine, head of securitised products at Henderson Investors in London. “It will be approved along with the creation of a new ‘Tarp Governance Body’ to ensure that ‘fair value’ is also fair to the taxpayer. Any other outcome is unimaginable.”Uncertainty about where the bias will settle between paying enough for assets to help bank solvency and being hard enough to really protect taxpayers is making it tough for markets to find a level.Much of the debate has also been about what kinds of assets will qualify. The initial plan suggested only mortgage assets, but that was quickly changed to allow greater flexibility.Analysts at Morgan Stanley this week said that the latest draft suggested that “everything is fair game”.Darrell Wheeler at Citigroup in New York says that credit derivatives on collateralised debt obligations containing subprime mortgage bonds were the key issue for the insurer AIG and that most of Lehman’s troubled commercial real estate positions actually involved floating-rate whole loans and bridge equity positions. The Tarp then might end up focusing more on these types of exposures than on plain residential mortgage backed securities or commercial mortgage backed securities.“We expect that most standard RMBS or CMBS positions held by institutions have already been near properly valued with the firms raising sufficient capital,” Mr Wheeler says. “The plan is really needed to provide liquidity for ‘oddball’ assets or lower credit assets where price discovery has been difficult.”In Europe, the rally is on less firm ground because any Tarp will not be open to non-dollar assets, even if it is extended to non-US banks and institutions. However, analysts at Deutsche Bank say European banks would still benefit.“Specifically, with regard to European structured finance, aside from the positive spillover effect from US ABS trading up, we also expect an improvement in market technicals as European-domiciled holders of US securitised risk assets offload illiquid bonds into the [Tarp], either directly or via an intermediary with access to the programme,” says Ganesh Rajendra, head of European securitisation research.Mr Rajendra, like many others, does not believe eurozone or UK governments are close to heeding Treasury secretary Hank Paulson’s call for them to follow the US lead. One obstacle for the UK specifically, he estimates, is that such a programme would cost far more as a proportion of national income.However, banks along with industry bodies such as the UK Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association are demanding action to stimulate mortgage markets, although they have yet to call explicitly for a Tarp-type solution. “In the UK, we have been of the opinion that it is essential that the government steps in and provides some cash to purchase or guarantee assets, be that whole loans or securities,” says Karsten Moller, head of Europe and Asia at SIFMA. “Starting new mortgage lending is essential.”“The UK looks and smells a lot like the US – there is a heavy reliance on securitisation, it has declining property markets and mortgage finance is stuck.”
1030;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-23T16:01:04Z;Eurozone falls into recession;;The eurozone has fallen into recession, with industry particularly badly hit by the fall-out from global economic turmoil, results of a closely watched survey indicated on Tuesday.Private sector output in the 15-country region contracted in September for the fourth consecutive month, according to eurozone purchasing managers’ indices. The pace of decline was the fastest since the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, with manufacturing faring worse than services.The latest data indicated that, even if the crisis on Wall Street has yet to have a direct impact on eurozone economies, global economic storms have pushed the region into a technical recession – two quarters of contracting gross domestic product.The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index – covering services as well as manufacturing – fell from 48.2 in August to 47 this month. A figure below 50 is meant to indicate a contraction in activity.Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, the information group that produces the survey, said on past experience the latest readings were consistent with stagnation. But the results excluded construction and retailing sectors, which had fared even worse over the period. “So you are looking at recession,” he concluded. Eurozone GDP had fallen by 0.2 per cent in the three months to June.But there was some better news on the inflation front, with the survey showing that prices of companies’ inputs rising at the weakest rate since October 2007, largely as a result of lower oil and other commodity prices.A further easing in inflationary pressures, together with signs that the growth slowdown will prove protracted, would encourage speculation that the European Central Bank will move towards cutting interest rates. The spreading global gloom has not escaped European policymakers, which watched aghast last week as US authorities allowed the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Still, with eurozone inflation at 3.8 per cent, and crucial wage negotiations looming in Germany’s engineering sector, economists remain sceptical that the ECB will make any move until the first few months of next year at the earliest.Industry was “reeling” from weak demand, Mr Williamson added, with the growth slowdown in emerging market economies and China “really hurting European manufacturers”.The latest data, which offered scant sign of an improvement in coming months, were a blow for the ECB. Prior to the crisis on Wall Street the central bank had argued that a weak third quarter would be followed by a gradual recovery in growth. Yesterday’s surveys showed new orders – an indication of likely future trends in production – fell this month at the fastest rate in five years.
1031;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-22T21:19:37Z;Fed action proves positive for ABS;;The US plan to buy up $700bn worth of mortgage backed bonds and other “troubled assets” gave a boost to markets in structured debt in spite of great uncertainty about the plan and concerns that it could ultimately hurt pricing.In the US, the positive response of a leading indicator for subprime mortgage-backed bonds ahead of the plan on Friday continued on Monday, while in Europe the derivatives of many residential mortgage-backed bonds also rallied.However, the US plan – which it hopes will be copied by other jurisdictions – could yet cause more pain for banks and insurers, particularly those that have resisted marking down the value of their holdings of such bonds as aggressively as others, according to analysts.US subprime mortgage bonds issued in the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 – those expected to see the worst credit losses – benefited most from news of the plan. Prices on the ABX 07-1 index of AAA bonds from the first half of last year, for example, leapt by 3.5 points to 51.25 per cent of face value on Friday from 47.8 per cent, according to Markit Group. In Europe, spreads on the most liquid prime RMSB were 10-20 basis points tighter, according to analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland, with Spanish, Greek and, to a lesser extent, UK bonds moving the most.Crucial to the market is the way in which financial institutions respond to the US Treasury’s expected “reverse auction”, so called because of the way they place bids for the prices at which they wish to sell eligible assets to the scheme, which has been dubbed the Troubled Asset Relief Program.“Reverse auctions tend to be associated with significant downward pressure on the value of the asset being traded,” according to analysts at CreditSights, an independent research house.This process could spark a wave of further writedowns as the asset transfers from weaker institutions set market pricing for many types of “level 3”, or difficult to value assets, that stronger banks continue to hold, the analysts added.“Our initial take is that the banks which have taken the more brutal marks on eligible and associated assets [and raised equity as a corollary] may benefit more from the line in the sand,” said analysts at a London-based bank. “Those banks/insurers which have professed ‘no need to write down assets as they have no intention of selling and that they will be OK in the end’ may not be so lucky and will now have a benchmark against which they should price,” they said.Analysts at Morgan Stanley in the US were more positive, saying that the plan should work well if it was pursued aggressively. “It should slow deleveraging, reduce risk premiums and allow institutions to more easily raise capital,” said Dick Berner.
1032;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-16T22:46:42Z;Cost of protecting against default on corporate debt soars;;The cost of protecting corporate debt against default set fresh records on Tuesday, outstripping even the levels seen in the run-up to the demise of Bear Stearns when concerns about financial company risk were at their highest.Banks and insurers were at the centre of the turmoil.Institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in the US and HBOS in Europe saw spreads on credit default swaps, which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of debt, hit stressed levels.The collapse of Lehman Brothers has undermined the “too-big-to-fail” concept that had given succour to credit markets after the Federal Reserve helped to orchestrate the rescue of Bear Stearns in March.Market fears were further heightened by the potential for a default by AIG, one of the world’s biggest insurers, which would have massive knock-on effects for financial institutions.The main US CDX index of investment-grade corporate debt, which contains many financial institutions, registered a big leap in protection premiums before it even opened.Markit Group, which runs the CDX indices, saw enough indicative quotes to provide intra-day spreads from about 6.30am New York time.The spread on the main index was 23 basis points greater at 217.5bp, easily surpassing the record levels hit ahead of the Bear rescue. By lunchtime, when hopes were raised for an AIG bail-out, the index had tightened back to 201bp, meaning it costs $201,000 annually to insure $10m of corporate debt in the index over five years.In Europe the iTraxx Crossover list of junk-rated names matched mid-March highs of 640bp, having opened at about 600bp. However, by the end of the day it had recovered to 624bp.The main iTraxx Europe index of investment-grade corporate debt was quoted as wide as 156bp, having closed at 125bp on Monday, though it also recovered later to be quoted at 144bp.Goldman Sachs CDS hit 570bp, having closed the previous day at 324bp, and Morgan Stanley hit 841bp having closed at 457bp.As a comparison, Bears Stearns CDS spreads closed at a record wide of 737bp on Friday March 14 before it was taken over by JPMorgan.In Europe, HBOS saw the biggest move in the index, mimicking the drop in its share price. Its cost of protection soared to more than 500bp having closed at 311bp.The extent of the volatility and and trading chaos in the markets was illustrated late Monday evening when Markit Group announced that dealers had voted to delay the upcoming six-monthly index changes by one week.The index “rolls”, which refresh the lists of companies to be included via a dealer poll of the most liquid qualifying names, are traditionally among the busiest periods for trading in CDS.While one head of trading talked of barely getting any sleep since the weekend, traders felt the system was holding up well under the pressure, particularly compared with last summer when the crunch first hit. Part of the reason was because banks were now generally holding less risk, said one head of trading.Nishul Saperia of Markit Group said: “The credit derivatives markets are holding up very well. Liquidity is strong.”INTRINSIC STRENGTHS OF DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS ASSUREDLehman Brothers collapse may have sent credit derivatives markets into a tailspin, but the basic strength of most of those contracts remains assured, lawyers and analysts have said.Lehman was counterparty to hundreds of billions of dollars of over-the-counter derivatives trades, referencing everything from the default risk of individual companies or complex structured bonds to interest rates and commodity prices.However, even more than with previous counterparty failures, the fact that the Lehman holding company filed for bankruptcy does not mean all contracts can be easily terminated.Lehman has myriad legal entities below the level of the holding company that are referenced in different swap contracts – not always with direct reference to the holding company as well.“If a contract references one of the entities that has entered insolvency then it is pretty clear that it can be closed out,” said Paul Cluley, a partner in Allen & Overy’s capital markets practice in London.“But if it only references entities that are still trading, then it has to be treated as an open contract and due payments have to be made.”He added that for the vast majority of credit default swap contracts struck using the master agreement of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the path to closing out is clear and well standardised.“Sure, it’s chaotic, everyone is running round with lots to do, but in terms of the ISDA agreements everyone knows what it is they have to do, it’s just that there are a lot of them to be processed.”Willem Sels, credit strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The ISDA agreement has led to a reasonable level of standardisation, particularly among the most liquid indices and single names. There is obviously lots of work in sorting out all the contracts to which Lehman was a counterparty, there are many legal entities, but this is more of a financial institutions problem than a weakness in the contracts themselves.”Angus Duncan, a partner at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, said that with bespoke contracts or with those that relate to more complex structured finance transactions, the process could be far more messy.“It is much more difficult to reach agreement where several parties, holding different interests, are involved,” he said.
1033;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-15T20:50:50Z;US stocks plummet to 3-year lows;;The Wall Street crisis prompted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and fears over AIG resulted in the biggest fall for US stocks since the September 11 attacks to their lowest level for nearly three years.Given its strong links to other financials through derivative contracts and other types of exposure, the shock of Lehman’s bankruptcy filing raised fresh concerns over the health of other financial institutions.The financial sector led declines among sectors in the S&P 500. It fell 10 per cent, which took its decline for the year to more than a third.The wider index closed down 4.7 per cent at 1,192.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.4 per cent lower at 10,917.51. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.6 per cent to 2,179.91.“Terrible – suicidal, maybe,” said Ben Warwick, chief investment officer at Sovereign Wealth Management of the mood on trading desks on Monday. RBS Greenwich analysts, meanwhile, described the session as a “new Black Monday for the financial market history books.”Underscoring the turmoil in financials, the cost of buying insurance on credit rose as investors sought to protect themselves against another collapse.Credit default swaps on most financial companies surged. Default protection on insurer AIG, for example, jumped to 35 points up front, or a $3.5mln payment plus $500,000 annually to insure $10mln of bonds for five years, according to Markit data. On Friday, it cost 12.5 points up front.Such jumps fed a sharp rise in equity volatility, illustrating the links between stocks and credit insurance. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 23.6 per cent to 31.7, a level not seen since the collapse of Bear Stearns in March.Still, Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital cautioned the index had “yet to enter the cathartic blow-out levels that typically marks a bottom.”American International Group sank another 60.8 per cent to $4.76 even after authorities threw the ailing insurer a $20bn lifeline. It came after Ken Lewis, Bank of America chief executive, told CNBC television that an AIG failure would be “much bigger problem” than Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.Meanwhile, the news that Bank of America was buying Merrill Lynch in a $50m all-share deal prompted a sharp slide in BofA. The shares fell 21.3 per cent to $26.55.Shares in Merrill were broadly flat, edging up 0.1 per cent at $17.06, well below the $29-a-share offer. Traders said the price for Merrill could fall after BofA goes through the books at Merrill in order to sign off on the deal.The two independent US investment banks still standing – Goldman Sachs, which reports its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley – fell 12.1 per cent to $135.50 and 13.5 per cent at $32.19, respectively.Moreover, implied volatility of both General Electric, one of the world’s largest issuers of debt, as well as Citigroup – a measure of expected future movements over the next month – have all risen to an all-time high.Washington Mutual slid another 26.7 per cent to $2 amid growing anxiety over the largest US savings and loan’s ability to raise capital.Elsewhere in financials, Citigroup fell 15.1 per cent at $15.24. American Express, the credit card company, lost 8.9 per cent at $35.48. Wachovia lost 25 per cent to $10.71Among the non-financial casualties, Idearc, the directories business, fell 19.7 per cent to $1.02. General Electric retreated 8 per cent at $24.60.In spite of the turmoil, some market analysts remained relatively sanguine. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi, said financials “should provide very attractive entry points. The sale of Merrill to Bank of America suggests less of a chance of a domino effect.”Meanwhile, a sharp drop in oil prices to below $95 a barrel – led the energy sector 6.9 per cent lower. Other sectors posting big drops included industrials, telecoms, materials and technology.Earlier in the day, the oil price decline gave some sectors a respite. Transport stocks enjoyed a boost. Delta Air Lines, for example, rose 4.8 per cent at one point in the session, only to finish 1 per cent lower at $8.05.Consumer stocks also held up better than the wider market and some of the more defensive or recession-proof names rallied. Coca-Cola rose 0.5 per cent at $54.75.
1034;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-03T20:41:26Z;Consumer gloom hits sterling and shares;;Gloom about Britain’s economic prospects deepened on Wednesday with fresh evidence that the woes of the financial sector were spreading further into the high street, sending the pound and the stock market lower.Surveys showed consumer confidence mired at a four-month low in August as food prices rose 10 per cent year-on-year. Other data showed activity in the services sector still weakening.The pound fell for the eighth straight day to a 12-year low against a basket of currencies of the UK’s main trading partners in reaction, while the FTSE 100, the stock market barometer, tumbled 2.15 per cent to 5,499.The latest poor data came ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which will consider whether it should cut its 5.0 per cent rate, a move markets increasingly expect before the year end.However, economists believe MPC members may need to see growth weaken much further before they can be confident that inflation has been wrung from the economy.A survey by Nationwide showed consumer confidence in August remained at its lowest point since it began polling sentiment in 2005. The latest Purchasing Managers’ Index survey for the services sector showed activity contracted again in the month with a headline reading of 49.2 per cent. Any reading below 50 indicates a fall in activity.The reading was better than some economists expected but CIPS/Markit, which carries out the survey, warned that “the economic climate remained difficult, depressing incoming new business and activity”. It noted a high degree of uncertainty among clients of the companies it surveys about the economic outlook, which is causing them to keep their spending on hold.There were signs that the force of the credit crunch is starting to eat its way into the wider economy. Punch Taverns on Wednesday scrapped its final dividend to conserve cash as the pub group reported weak sales at its managed and leased pub estates.Giles Thorley, chief executive, said the credit squeeze made it uncertain whether Punch, the UK’s biggest pub group, would be able to raise finance when it needed to repay a £295m convertible bond in December 2010.Although that was still some way off, he said it would be more prudent to save up cash now in case the capital markets did not reopen in time.“This is a sign that the problems in the financial markets are starting to affect real companies now,” said Jonathan Loynes, economist at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, the falling pound appears to be doing little to help retailers. Falling demand for electrical goods across Europe caused fresh pain for DSG International as the owner of PC World and Currys reported declining like-for-like sales.
1035;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-09-03T12:51:00Z;Services decline four months in row;;Activity in Britain’s key services sector declined for the fourth successive month in August, albeit at a much slower pace than earlier this year, according to the latest UK Services PMI Index.The Purchasing Managers’ headline index reading rose to 49.2 from 47.4 but remained below the 50.0 reading which shows that activity is unchanged.The survey, which is compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply and Markit, a provider of data, also showed a high degree of uncertainty that has led clients of service sector employers to put new spending on hold.“Purchasing managers in the UK services sector reported a continued decline in August, although at the weakest rate since May,” said Roy Ayliffe, director of professional practice at CIPS. “However, any murmurs of hope were silenced by recession fears and uncertainty continued to dominate, as the property downturn hit client spending.”The latest services sector survey coincided with the Nationwide Building Society’s consumer confidence index which remained mired at a series low. This latest piece of gloomy news for the UK economy, sent sterling to a fresh low for the eighth straight day against a Bank of England trade-weighted index of currencies, and again hit its lowest against the dollar since April 2006.The new orders index, a sub-heading of the overall index, rose slightly to 47.1 from 44.7, suggesting that new business is not falling quite as rapidly as it had been earlier this year, but the financial intermediation sector continued to register the steepest declines in new business.August’s survey also showed further contraction of outstanding backlogs as spare capacity in the service sector remains prevalent. CIPS/Markit said that its panel reported that a combination of overcapacity and lack of new incoming orders made it easier for companies to clear unfinished orders at a faster rate than it was replaced.Meanwhile, UK employers indicated further job-shedding in August, with losses greatest in the hotels and restaurants sector. The employment index was 47.9, up slightly from 46.6 in July but below 50.0, indicating contraction.On the inflation front, employers continue to increase charges but at a slightly slower rate than in previous months. Service providers signalled that output prices had been raised as part of efforts to recover some of the loss to margins arising from higher input costs.But companies’ own costs continue to rise strongly, even if not at as fast a rate as they did in late spring. The average input costs component of the index registered 66.8, down from 70.2 in July but still well above the survey’s long-run average rate of 58.1. There were some indications from employers that the easing in fuel prices may be starting to have some effect.Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates to stimulate the economy appeared a more distant prospect with publication of the British Retail consortium’s shop price deflator which showed prices rising a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent in August, even more rapidly than the level in July.The annual increase in food prices jumped to 10 per cent in August, up from 9.5 per cent in July and from 4.7 per cent in April. Non-food prices also rose in August, albeit at a slower pace.The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee meets Thursday to vote on interest rates and economists widely expect these to remain unchanged at 5.0 per cent.“While shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices, the Bank of England will also note that non-food prices rose up year-on-year for a third month running in August, and at an increased rate, after extended falls,” said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. “This will maintain concern that retailers are increasingly trying to pass on their elevated costs.”Separately, one spot of good news came from the latest Nationwide Consumer Confidence Survey which showed no further deterioration in confidence in August.It was the first month in over a year that the outlook has not appeared increasingly gloomy to consumers. However, the survey found growing concerns about the outlook for current and future employment.
1036;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;iTraxx Crossover rules to ease;;The gloomy outlook for corporate credit in Europe has led banks to vote for a relaxation in the rules that excluded riskier companies from the junk-rated credit derivatives index run by Markit Group, the data provider said on Thursday.The rule change increases the maximum risk premium, or spread, paid to protect a company’s debt against default via a credit default swap, before these derivatives are considered too risky to be in the so-called iTraxx Crossover.Markit said the changes were made to “reflect the changed market conditions” which have led to heightened volatility seen since the credit crunch hit last year. “This has been done to reflect the higher spreads we are seeing,” said Tobias Sproehnle, director of indices at Markit.“When the rules were implemented it was to allow toxic names to be kicked out. The market now is trading generally at much wider spreads, so there is a higher probability that individual names could trade at these wider levels without being toxic.”Under existing rules, any company, or name, that trades with a spread above 1,250 basis points, or with a 35 per cent upfront payment, would be removed from the index at the next six-monthly roll. With the new rules, which will be enacted ahead of the next roll in late September, that maximum has been increased to an upfront payment of 25 per cent plus a 500bp spread, which is equivalent to about 1,440bp. Under the upfront payment and running spread calculation, an investor would have to pay up to €2.5m ($3.7m) at the start plus €500,000 annually to buy protection on €10m of debt over a five-year CDS contract.Protection sellers demand up-front payments when they want to compensate for the perceived risk of the “insured” company defaulting on its debt before the contract expires.There are seven companies in the current series of the Crossover that are quoted in points up front, and at least three of them would not have made it into the September series of the index if the old rules had been applied. Under the new regime, only one – WIND Hellas, a Greek telecoms company – would be ejected.The US version of the index, the CDX Crossover, does not have similar spread limit rules, Mr Sproehnle said.Separately, Moody’s said late on Wednesday that the number of Caa rated corporate issuers — a rating that signals very high credit risk — was on the rise amid the weakening economy, tight credit markets and the prevalence of issuers with highly leveraged capital structures.
1037;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
1038;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-08-05T10:50:30Z;Weak data signal deepening economic slowdown;;More signs of a deepening economic slowdown in the UK emerged on Tuesday with publication of data on the manufacturing and services sectors.The key Industrial Production Index showed an unexpected 0.8 per cent drop in the three months to June from the previous quarter while for June alone it contracted by 0.2 per cent. The manufacturing component of that index showed a drop of 0.5 per cent in June from May.“It is clear that manufacturers are now being hit hard by muted domestic demand, weakening activity in key export markets, elevated energy and commodity prices and tight credit conditions,” said Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight.Moreover, the closely-watched purchasing managers’ survey for the services sector - the UK economy’s single most important sector - rose slightly to 47.4 in July from 47.1 in June but nevertheless indicated further solid contraction of activity. A reading below 50 indicates shrinking activity.The CIPS/Markit purchasing managers’ survey also pointed to a sharp contraction of incoming business. The Incoming New business Index, a component of the PMI, posted a reading of 44.7, the third successive monthly fall and the sharpest in the 12-year history of the survey.Additionally, increasing pessimism among some service providers is leading to job reductions, signalling a future rise in UK unemployment. UK services providers, in the Employment Index component, recorded a reading of 46.6.In particular, weakness was recorded in the financial services and hotels and restaurants sectors.PMI surveys, particularly of the services sector, are closely watched signposts for economic activity by members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee. The MPC meets this Thursday to consider interest rate policy and the data may offset some concerns about surging inflation that some argue will require an interest rate rise later this year.Indeed, the survey data provide some hints that cost inflation may have peaked, with input prices still rising albeit at a slower pace than that recorded in June.Paul Smith, economist at Markit Economics, said: “Combined with the construction and manufacturing PMI data, the services survey confirms that private sector growth has practically ground to a halt at the start of the third quarter, with the rate of expansion only very marginal at best.”
1039;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-08-01T09:50:02Z;Rising inflation pressures point to more pain;;Economists on Friday forecast months of intensifying pain in the economy as a survey showed manufacturers were pessimistic about orders but intent on raising prices.The toxic combination of intensifying inflationary pressure at the same time as a slowdown is likely to prevent the Bank of England cutting interest rates soon.All 76 economists polled by Reuters this week thought the monetary policy committee would hold rates at 5 per cent next Thursday. A sizeable majority thought rates would remain unchanged for the rest of the year.The UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 44.3 in July from 45.9 in June, worse than many City economists had predicted and the lowest score on this measure since December 1998. But the expected prices charged by manufacturers in the survey, produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit, rose to 63.1, the highest reading on this measure since the series started in 1999.Roy Ayliffe, a director at the Cips, said: “Shortages of raw materials – in addition to weaker demand – were a worrying factor behind the further fall in manufacturing output in July, while headcount was reduced to the greatest extent since late 2001 as part of the wider effort to combat record cost inflation.”The index scores do not translate mechanically into real output figures or inflation rates, but the Cips says that scores below 50 represent falling output.The figures led other City economists to predict the economy would contract in the months ahead.Alan Clarke of BNP Paribas said the survey results for manufacturing output, alongside similarly weak survey numbers last month, were “now consistent with negative GDP growth”.Kevin Daly of Goldman Sachs forecast on Friday the economy would contract by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter and by 0.1 per cent in the following quarter but added: “The recession is likely to prove short-lived.”The view that the economy is sliding into recession is gaining ground quickly among economists, but not all think this is a reason to avoid raising interest rates.Michael Saunders of Citi said the MPC had a horrible task ahead. “Can they afford to hike rates when the economy is almost certainly going into recession? Can they afford not to hike rates when they are going to publish a forecast that CPI inflation will rise to about 5 per cent in coming months?”
1040;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-07-31T20:25:46Z;Plans for central clearing house for derivatives;;Big banks and dealers should have a central clearing house for the $62,000bn credit derivatives market by the end of the year, marking an important milestone in efforts to reduce systemic risks from inefficient trading and counterparty exposures.Dealers also committed themselves to expanding automated trade-matching and electronic processing in other over-the-counter derivatives markets when they delivered a progress report on Thursday to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The NY Fed is spearheading the regulatory drive to cut trading and settlement risks in OTC derivatives markets.The near-failure of Bear Stearns in March sent shivers around the financial world as its collapse would have had profound knock-on effects on other financial institutions in part due to the counterparty credit exposures from thousands of OTC derivatives contracts. Credit derivatives in particular were a cause for concern.Other sectors, such as the even larger interest-rate derivatives, are still far from the efficient and well-administered operations the NY Fed would like to see. Large numbers of trades in the sector are still unconfirmed days after they are made.“Especially given recent experiences, it is key to know what your exposures to other counterparties are,” said Eraj Shirvani, chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a managing director at Credit Suisse.Progress on electronic processing of credit derivatives has been good, with more than 90 per cent of trades conducted electronically by the end of June, according to data from Markit Group.However, equity derivatives trading – also part of the Fed’s initial focus – is still lagging with only about 25 per cent of trades done electronically. Interest rate derivatives, by far the largest section of the OTC derivatives markets, have improved dramatically since last year but still are only just over 50 per cent of trades.It is only in credit derivatives that plans are afoot for a central counterparty, although participants said it was possible such plans might be extended to other sectors of the derivatives market. Further plans will be detailed in October.About 11 dealers are working to revamp the Chicago-based Clearing Corp into the credit derivatives industry’s main clearing house.In order to allow for central clearing, all parts of the credit default swap market need to operate electronically and be integrated.Dealers have agreed to significantly reduce the total value of outstanding CDS trades, to “hardwire” a cash settlement mechanism into CDS documentation to help sort out corporate defaults by the end of the year. There are also moves to improve collateral management by reconciling portfolios on a weekly basis.
1041;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit buys analytics business;;Data and trade processing company Markit Group is expanding its reach in the syndicated loan market with the purchase of an analytics business from JPMorgan. The price for the deal was not disclosed.Markit is buying JPMorgan FCS, which is a provider of portfolio and risk management software and services for the syndicated loan market. Markit now offers loan pricing services. The combined entity will be used by more than 400 financial institutions to manage more than $1,000bn in assets, the two groups said.The move comes after explosive growth in loan issuance during the boom years for credit.At the same time, the investor base has expanded from a small club of banks to a wide group that includes hedge funds.Since 2001, Markit has acquired 13 companies to augment its in-house pricing information with data valuations and processing. The group, which is based in London, is majority owned by 15 large banks.Markit has a strong foothold in the credit markets, but it also operates in the equities, interest rate, foreign exchange and commodities markets. Last year, Markit bought the companies that produce the iTraxx and CDX credit default indexes, the benchmarks for the $62,000bn credit derivatives market.The FCS deal also will enable Markit to develop products to process loan trading electronically in the future, said Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit. Last week, Markit announced a joint venture for processing and confirming OTC derivatives trades with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).The DTCC is a large US clearer and settlement group that owns a specialist post-trade confirmation and matching service.“The combination puts us at the table for any discussions about electronic trade processing for loans, which we expect to develop over the next six to 12 months,” Mr Uggla said.
1042;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Banks drop Ineos loan sale;;Banks have abandoned the €620m (£490m) sale of risky loans used by Ineos, one of the world’s biggest chemical companies, to fund an acquisition this year, in a sign the credit crunch is still making it difficult to sell debt.The failed debt syndication comes as the leveraged loan markets enter a new period of difficulty having enjoyed a brief respite during the months following the rescue of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank.In that time, banks were able to shift some of the loans they had provided for leveraged buy-outs before the credit crunch hit, which they were then unable to sell on.For example, in May, some of the underwriters of the Alliance Boots buy-out financing were able to sell a big chunk of the debt that had been on their books since last year.But the average bid of the most traded European leveraged loans has fallen 308 basis points from 91.7 per cent of face value during the past four weeks, according to data from S&P Leveraged Commentary and Data and Markit, the lowest level since April 3.Ineos, the UK’s biggest private company with sales approaching $45bn (£23bn), bought Norsk Hydro’s polymers business in February.Ineos declined to comment on the debt sale but said the financing was a standalone financing by Ineos Capital, a unit of Ineos, and there was no refinancing need by Ineos Group, which has about €8bn of debt according to Standard & Poor’s.Barclays Capital and Merrill Lynch, the underwriters of the financing, are in talks to change the terms of the debt facility, according to people involved.Banks first started the syndication more than a month ago but deteriorating market conditions and weak demand for companies in cyclical sectors, made the process difficult to complete.Ineos, like others in its industry, has been facing difficult market conditions in the face of rising oil prices and anticipated downturn in the petrochemicals sector, although it says it has a diversified business offering counter-cyclical protection.Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, last month downgraded the outlook on its rating of Ineos’s debt on expected tight covenant leeway and liquidity, particularly in 2009.
1043;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Eurex moves into clearing for OTC credit markets;;Eurex, Europe’s largest derivatives exchange, on Tuesday night joined the rush to provide clearing services for over-the-counter credit markets by unveiling plans to clear credit default swaps.The initiative comes a day after US rival CME Group said it would expand its clearing services into OTC interest-rate swaps.At the same time Markit Group, a data and trade processing company, announced a joint venture for processing and confirming OTC derivatives with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services provider.Eurex said its initiative “aims to complement current US initiatives with a European solution”.It was in talks with “several other infrastructure providers concerning their involvement in a new platform” for the service. One of them is the DTCC, sources familiar with the talks said.The moves come as regulators press for a reduction in the potential systemic risks inherent in such bilaterally negotiated markets. Eurex said its initiative was “designed to address recent developments in the OTC market that suggest concerns about systemic risk due to the backlog of transaction confirmation and potential counterparty defaults require improvements in the market’s infrastructure”.The Eurex platform, set for launch in the first half of next year, will initially focus on iTraxx index exposures mainly traded out of Europe.“An extension to other asset classes – for example equity and fixed income – can be handled flexibly according to market demand,” Eurex said.Kevin McPartland, senior analyst at Tabb Group, said: “With the increasing concern over counterparty risk, it [the Eurex plan] is not surprising. Exchanges see the growth and size of the OTC markets and want a piece of that pie.”In Europe, Eurex rival Liffe plans in the fourth quarter to launch credit default swaps based on iTraxx indices. They will be cleared on BClear, a service offered by Liffe that clears through LCH.Clearnet.The Clearing Corporation, a Chicago-based clearer, is also working on offering clearing of OTC credit products. It is backed in part by a group of investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, which has taken the lead in coming up with an OTC clearing solution outside the scope of the exchanges.Eurex said a European OTC clearing platform would increase capital efficiency by reducing balance sheet exposure, while promoting “the optimal use of margin deposits”.
1044;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-07-21T21:44:47Z;Deadline looms for assurances on risks purge;;Dealers in the $62,000bn credit derivatives market have less than two weeks to reassure the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that they are staying ahead in the race to purge trading and settlement risks from one of the world’s biggest financial sectors.A sense of urgency has gripped the credit derivatives industry in the wake of Bear Stearns’ failure in March. When the investment bank teetered on the point of collapse, the Fed backed a fire sale to JPMorgan because it feared Bear’s bankruptcy would plunge credit derivatives into chaos.Major banks and brokerages have become tightly bound by a chain of credit derivative trades.In the days leading up to the sale of Bear Stearns, other dealers were deluged by requests from investors seeking to exit their current trades with Bear, which strained the risk management systems of some of the world’s biggest investment banks.These links between the big dealers and their wider audience of hedge funds and other investors – known as counterparty risk – keeps regulators awake at night. Gaps in the present trading infrastructure, which has failed to match the growth, complexity and various operational and market risks associated with credit derivatives, are a further worry.“The tone has changed,” says a managing director at a major dealer. “Regulators are less tolerant of spikes in volatility and the inability of the major dealers to handle it.”Last month, the New York Fed convened a meeting with dealers and big investment firms to outline a series of goals for the credit derivatives market, such as the creation of a central clearing house and the industry-wide use of automated trade processing, to be achieved by the end of the year. The Fed expects a progress report by July 31.“Dealers are very mindful of what the Fed and other regulators’ hopes and intentions are on this issue ” said Doug Warren, managing director and head of US credit derivatives at Barclays Capital. “The rate of progress will be a function of having 16 dealers and hundreds of buy-side clients involved in trying to standardise a complex infrastructure.”While dealers acknowledge the rules of the game have changed, they are also mindful of retaining control over what has been a very good source of profits and they do not want to let big exchanges or other outsiders gain a foothold.Many of the initiatives that regulators are clamouring for are already being done piecemeal.For example, numerous vendors and suppliers are focused on improving settlement and trading in credit derivatives as well as other over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as interest rate swaps.Some, such as the Depositary Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC) and Markit are owned by dealers. Others, such as Creditex and TriOptima, are part of the inter-dealer broker sector.They are all fighting for a piece of the action. Adding another piece to the jigsaw, DTCC and Markit on Monday said they would form a new company. “We are taking a major step forward in addressing the calls from global regulators and customers for a fully integrated system for processing OTC derivatives,” said Lance Uggla, Markit chief executive.The credit derivatives market has been the focus of regulators for several years, led by the New York Fed. Although progress has been made on some fronts, full automation has so far remained elusive. In spite of the volumes and complexity, much of the trading is now documented by nothing more than an e-mail, and can take several days to complete.Unlike an equity trade, which begins and ends with the trade itself, credit default swaps are insurance policies against default for a specified period of time, usually five years.As such, the relationship between the counterparties is significant beyond the day of the actual trade agreement.One area where efforts have progressed is on plans to create a clearing house, with 10 dealers, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, pushing ahead with efforts to launch Clearing Corp.Even if it is set up, it would not fully eliminate counterparty risk as under the current plans it involves just the main dealers and only derivatives traded on indices. Meanwhile, established exchanges such as the UK’s Liffe are also vying for some share of the market, earmarked by many in the sector as a potential area of growth.Regulators want the majority of trades to be confirmed and processed on the same day that they are executed, known as T+zero. Until trades across the entire market are being confirmed on the same day, regulators argue that the industry remains vulnerable, particularly when volumes spike during volatile periods.In this area, there are still competing systems being used.There is also a push to reduce trades in the system, especially credit derivatives that are no longer liquid. In a sign of potential future co-operation, Markit and Creditex recently began working together on a “compression” system, which terminates some trades.Another goal is creating a standard protocol that would permit cash settlement of obligations following a default or other credit event.Without it, there are concerns that a rise in the corporate default rate could lead to a freeze in the market and have knock-on effects on the credit-worthiness of participants. Using bonds from the company is not feasible, given the huge amount of credit derivative swaps.Yet, at a time when banks are facing cash constraints, the costs of overhauling the derivatives infrastructure are daunting, potentially leading to greater dominance of fewer big dealers.“The cost will be prodigious,” said the managing director of the major dealer.“You have to reach a certain bar to play this game. If you can’t reach it, you need to cut back your volume.”
1045;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-07-16T21:20:24Z;Europe learns to live with high prices;;"Judit Stadler surveys Hun­yadi Square market’s stalls with a wary eye. The 73-year-old Budapest pensioner is used to scrimping and saving. “The trick is to make sure you always go to the market on a Thursday or Friday,” she says. “The fresh stuff comes on Saturday, so it’s cheaper at the end of the week. You’ve got to be careful, but you can manage.”Hungarians, like all Europeans, are tightening their belts in response to higher inflation, heightening concerns about consumer spending trends and, in turn, overall economic activity.In Hungary, the impact on spending patterns could be limited. Before 1989, the country was the communist eastern bloc’s “happiest barrack”, where social peace was bought by using foreign credit to satisfy the population’s consumerist inclinations. Almost two decades later, habits die hard. “Whereas in Poland and Romania consumers have used credit to buy flats, here credit is being used to smooth out consumption,” says Eszter Gargyan, an economist at Citibank.Elsewhere, changes in behaviour appear more pronounced. Among the 15 eurozone countries, the corrosive effects of higher inflation rates are apparent, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles purchasing managers’ indices. Travel, hotel and restaurant businesses had seen sharp falls in activity and were “sectors where there is a distinct trend towards consumer restraint and price consciousness”.European car purchases have shown a switch to smaller models: Mercedes sales were flat in the first half of the year, while Smart cars were up 30 per cent on the first half of 2007.Trends towards fewer holidays, more farm-shopping and greater use of public transport – and even cutbacks in clothing and beauty products – are clear in Italy. The Confcommercio retailers’ association reported a 2.7 per cent fall in consumer spending in May. Six out of the past seven months have shown a decline. Sales of cars, motorcycles and air tickets fell 13.5 per cent; spending on culture and entertainment was down 4.9 per cent and clothing by 2.3 per cent.Italians are sometimes slow to change but shifting patterns and signs of distress are evident across society. Caritas, the Catholic charity, says requests for help from the Rome municipality have doubled over the past year. Farms where customers pick their own fruit and vegetables report more people coming more often but spending less. Public transport usage has increased by 8 per cent over the past two months.In Germany, consumers have been famously parsimonious for years. But there are signs of consumers retrenching still further. Andreas Rees at Unicredit in Munich says that in May, fuel demand was 17 per cent lower than in the same month in 2000, while anecdotal evidence points to an increase in “Tanktourismus” – driving abroad to fill up your car’s tank to take advantage of lower prices.As millions of French people prepare to head off at the start of the holiday season, a recent survey found that 40 per cent were using their cars less than in the past and relying on other types of transport instead.In the UK, where the government on Wednesday postponed a planned 2p rise in fuel duty, the country’s shopping spirit is flagging. Sales at upmarket food stores such as Marks & Spencer are suffering, while the supermarket Asda has noticed people spending less in the week before payday, and opting for stodgy staples such as potatoes and minced meat rather than summer delicacies.The Spanish have also taken matters into their own hands. According to the head of Coca-Cola for Iberia, sales of the soft drink in bars, restaurants and cafés have dropped 6 per cent in Spain in the past 12 months.“People are going out less, so they buy their Coca-Cola at the supermarket and drink it at home,” says Marcos de Quinto.Reporting by Thomas Escritt in Budapest, Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt, Guy Dinmore in Rome, Mark Mulligan in Madrid, Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Ben Hall in Paris"
1046;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-07-01T09:04:12Z;UK manufacturing weakens sharply;;UK manufacturing activity weakened sharply last month, a survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting that exporters’ gain from a weaker pound has been more than offset by slower domestic demand and intense cost inflation.The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply and the research group Markit said their index of activity in the sector dropped sharply from 49.5 in May to 45.8 in June, much weaker than expected, reflecting falling orders as clients postponed or cancelled projects.The overall reading was the lowest since late 2001. CIPS said companies were scaling back production at the fastest rate since 1998 and cutting jobs even though they were also clearing backlogs of work at a record rate.“The market sector of the economy is now contracting, or close to doing so,” said economists at Goldman Sachs – although noting that strong retail sales data would probably keep official estimates of output stable in the second quarter.The survey’s release coincides with data showing manufacturers in the eurozone also had a torrid month. In the UK, CIPS said export orders fell as slower global growth cut demand in overseas markets including China, the US and France.But the downturn was mainly due to weaker domestic demand, especially from construction and retail clients and the public sector.CIPS surveys of the manufacturing and services sectors are closely watched by policymakers as a guide to output growth, and they are now at levels where the Bank of England has cut interest rates in the past.“The case against rate hikes this year is becoming more compelling despite the overshoot in headline inflation,” said Holger Schmieding, economist at Bank of America, adding that the Bank would pay more attention to stock market falls than other central banks, given the City’s weight in the economy.But there appears to be no let up in the inflationary pressures that markets think will keep interest rates on hold – or spur the Bank of England to raise rates in the next few months.The surge in oil prices drove up costs at the fastest rate in the survey’s 16 ½ year history. Even though some respondents said they had been unable to raise prices as much as they wanted, factory gate inflation also hit a new high for the survey.CIPS said several respondents to the survey had reported higher costs for transport and raw materials were making them less able to compete overseas.The Office for National Statistics also released data on Tuesday showing corporate profitability in the non-financial sector remained surprisingly strong in the first quarter of 2008, although manufacturers’ net rate of return had fallen markedly. But Ross Walker at Royal Bank of Scotland said the latest trends suggested “a much more marked deterioration in economic activity”.
1047;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-07-01T01:01:49Z;Banks seek market-based pricing scheme;;Banks are asking corporate clients to accept new ways of pricing loans in an effort to cut potential losses as market conditions deteriorate.The request tackles a key concern for banks sitting on an estimated $6,000bn of undrawn loans agreed before the credit crunch hit last summer.At that time, companies were able to secure loan facilities at historically thin margins over Libor. While banks are obliged to honour those low rates, their own costs of funding have risen.Bankers have become increasingly concerned that companies will draw on these more favourably priced short-term loans rather than issue bonds, which are more expensive.Porsche, the German carmaker, highlighted this trend when it drew down on a standing €10bn ($14.7bn, £8bn) credit line in February.With many US companies having to refinance these short-term revolving credit facilities in recent months, banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan have sought to link the pricing of the loans to moves in the market rather than charging a fixed spread above Libor. Companies such as AT&T have agreed to have some of their loans priced in this way.With market-based pricing, the margin for these revolving credit facilities is linked to the cost of protecting against the borrower’s default, based on data provided Markit Partners, at the time that the company seeks to draw down on a facility. Evan Zebooker, director at Markit, said the company was working with other key industry players to establish this pricing method as a market standard.The approach allows borrowers to raise more money over longer periods of time. Borrowers can also benefit from price differentials if market conditions improve.With lenders being more selective about how they deploy capital, this market-based pricing system is encouraging banks and investors to lend as they are being better compensated for the use of their capital.“This pricing system has had more use in the US where there has been a greater number of companies extending or renewing existing credit facilities as well as for short-term bridge facilities,” said Steven Victorin, head of global loans for Europe and North America at Citi. He added there was the potential to introduce market-based pricing in Europe, particularly as the rate of companies looking to renew their facilities accelerated next year.“This system allows companies to renew credit facilities, which banks might have otherwise looked to reduce,” said Andy O’Brien, co-head of leverage finance at JPMorgan. “Several large European corporates considered putting in place these sort of facilities.”JPMorgan has arranged this financing for about 12 US companies, representing 75 per cent of the new financings being done in the US market.
1048;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Turmoil leads to new index for US munis;;Dealers and investors in the market for US municipal debt will next week begin trading an index of derivatives to protect investors against municipal default.The new index, from administrator and data provider Markit and called Markit MCDX, comes as the normally quiet municipal bond market has been rocked by broader financial turmoil.The upheaval has led investors to look for ways to hedge the risk that a municipal issuer will fail to make good its obligations, in spite of historically low default rates in the $2,200bn market for municipal debt.“Traditionally, munis were regarded as such a safe investment that credit risk wasn’t really a worry,” said Nishul Saperia, head of US credit indices at Markit. “But with deterioration in health of the monoline [bond insurers] and the spread widening in the credit markets over the past year, credit risk has become a real focus for muni investors.”As a result, investors have taken a growing interest in the market for credit default swaps (CDS) based on municipal bond issuers such as states and local authorities. Some of these issuers have suffered from funding difficulties while others’ bonds have suffered because they are guaranteed by bond insurers whose credit ratings have been questioned.Derivative instruments also provide a way to speculate on the value of such debt falling. While aggregate trading volumes in the over the counter derivatives market are difficult to measure, one dealer estimates that the volume of US muni CDS trades has gone from several hundred million dollars in the five years before July 2007 to more than $50bn.Drew Loughlin, managing director in municipal derivatives trading at JPMorgan said the launch of an index was likely to bring further liquidity and boost trading volumes.“Investors are looking for ways to hedge their muni portfolios without having to sell their bonds outright. Liquidity in the single-name market has not always been consistent, but an index should provide the diverse and liquid exposure that investors are looking for,” he said.Niall Cameron, global head of indices and equities at Markit, said he expected the index would also entice new investors to the market. “Interest in the muni market has been largely confined to US investors, but we expect the tradability and liquidity of the MCDX to attract new overseas investors.”The new index comprises 50 CDS referencing investment-grade municipal issuers of general fund and revenue obligations.Trading is set to begin on Tuesday, with market makers that include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Lehman Brothers.
1049;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Hands’ EMI deal faces £170m in extra costs;;Guy Hands’ Terra Firma vehicle faces up to £170m in additional charges on its purchase of music publisher EMI after the breakdown of talks with the trustees of the company pension scheme.The trustees have asked the Pensions Regulator to decide how much additional cash the scheme ought to hold after EMI’s sale to Terra Firma, a deal that left the music group £2.85bn in debt. It is the first time the regulator has been required to use these powers.Ian Smellie, chairman of the trustees, said an outline deal had fallen apart when lawyers for the scheme realised that the promise to give the scheme the same call over assets as the company’s creditors was not there.“In certain events like restructuring or asset sales we would have been frozen out,” he said. “Taken to the extreme, all of the assets of the company could have been sold and we would be left with nothing.”Mr Smellie said the 22,000 member scheme had a shortfall ranging from £50m to £170m depending on EMI’s financial prospects. EMI has struggled since the deal was closed. Its financial woes have prompted the trustees to seek a more conservative investment strategy.The cost of insuring £10m of EMI debt for five years is £818,000, more than twice the cost after the deal closed in October, according to Markit data.According to an adviser familiar with the talks between Terra Firma and its lender, Citi, the bank had agreed the pension scheme would have equal call over as much as £100m of assets. But Citi stopped short of promising to share proceeds of restructuring or disposals.Citigroup was forced to withdraw its £2.4bn of EMI loans from a £12bn portfolio of leveraged loans it put up for sale this month after potential buyers requested information it was unable to provide.The regulator on Tuesday night acknowledged it had received the request but declined to comment.
1050;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-04-23T23:31:07Z;Fears of big bank failures recede;;Investor fears over failures by big banks have receded sharply in recent weeks, pricing trends in the credit derivatives markets have revealed.Confidence has been bolstered by the flurry of unconventional moves by central banks to stabilise the financial system, coupled with new efforts by banks themselves to shore up their balance sheets.Some analysts hope these signs of a mood shift may herald a turning point for the financial system.“In terms of systemic risk, we may well have passed the worst,” said Neil McLeish, credit strategist at Morgan Stanley. “We think for financials we are just about entering the repair stage of the credit cycle.”The cost of insuring banks against default through so-called credit default swaps has dropped sharply. Earlier this year, the cost of such insurance surged to record levels. However, over the past five weeks the cost of protecting the senior debt of the 25 European banks in the iTraxx Financials index has fallen from 160 basis points to 61.5bp, according to Markit Group.This means it now costs an average of €61,500 ($97,800) a year to insure €10m of the banks’ debt against default over five years, €99,000 less than it did in mid-March. In the US, the cost of insuring the senior debt of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch has fallen 58, 59 and 51 per cent respectively over the same period.Traders say the turning point for the CDS market was March 17, when the US Federal Reserve-led rescue of Bear Stearns signalled that key players within the financial system would not be allowed to fail. Subsequent central bank moves to stabilise the financial system – including this week’s £50bn ($100bn) “gilts-for-mortgages” swap by the Bank of England – has further bolstered sentiment.The latest dose of good news for debt-holders came from Royal Bank of Scotland, which is rebuilding its balance sheet by raising £12bn from shareholders.This move has badly hurt the bank’s shares, which have lost about a 10th of their value this week. However, the cost of insuring its debt has fallen 6 per cent in the same period.Analysts forecast similar efforts by other European banks. “RBS opens the floodgates and I think a lot of banks in Europe will do recapitalisations,’’ said Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank, adding that such rights issues “may benefit the credit holder at the expense of the equity holder”.
1051;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Sloppy practices dog credit derivatives market;;The problems in processing credit derivatives are still dogging the industry in spite of a concerted effort since 2005 to end sloppy practices which prevent some trades from being confirmed, according to a new survey.Sharp rises in trading volumes in the over-the-counter derivatives markets since last summer, as investors rushed to make bets on the impact of the credit crunch, led to corresponding spikes in unconfirmed trades, according to data released on Tuesday by Markit Group.The report shows that average outstanding confirmations leapt from about 6,000 per dealer bank to more than 13,000 between June and August last year as average monthly trading volumes rose from just under 20,000 to more than 25,000 per dealer.However, the industry has performed better in recent months. Trading volumes dipped at the end of the year, but have since returned to near-peak levels of about 25,000 trades per dealer for each of the first three months of the year. The average backlog of trades reported by dealers for these three months remained relatively low, at about 6,000-7,500 each month.Regulators continue to pay close attention to the infrastructure of these markets, particularly in light of the wave of financial job losses hitting the US and UK, which will mainly affect the so-called back-office staff, who are responsible for administration.A recent report from the Financial Stability Forum highlighted the substantial increases in the backlog of unconfirmed trades in recent months and urged the industry to redouble its efforts to stamp out the problems.“Despite the significant progress that the industry has made in automating the infrastructure of the OTC derivatives markets during the last two years, the industry has not reached a ‘steady state’ in which spikes in trading volume do not lead to operational problems,” the FSF report said.Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the New York Fed and one of the driving forces behind the regulatory focus on credit derivatives backlogs in 2005, also maintains a strong focus on financial infrastructure in his work with senior finance executives to produce a report on the recent credit turmoil.Regulators are, however, likely to be encouraged by the shift of derivatives dealing onto electronic platforms, which can help to speed up the processing and administration of trades.The Markit data show that the percentage of average monthly volumes conducted electronically have risen from about 45 per cent in September 2005 to more than 90 per cent since the turn of this year.
1052;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-04-10T21:44:44Z;Markit acquires PMI indicators;;Markit Group has captured a key set of global macro-economic indicators after the third-party data provider struck a deal to buy the company that produces the Purchasing Managers Index surveys.The PMI surveys are monthly indicators of business conditions in manufacturing, construction and service sectors across 26 countries that are closely-watched by central banks and have the power to move markets dramatically.The acquisition is the first foray into economic research for Markit, which is better known for providing pricing of over-the-counter derivatives and which recently bought control of the world’s leading credit derivative indices. The company hopes the PMI deal, whose value was not disclosed, will make it part of the global capital markets furniture.“It gets us known among central banks, governments and regulators,” said Niall Cameron, head of equities and indices at Markit. “This helps us to build our reputation . . . it makes us part of the establishment.”Most key economic indicators are produced by government agencies or institutes but the PMIs have been produced by NTC Economics, a private company with 40 employees in Henley-upon-Thames, outside London.NTC surveys thousands of companies and avoids asking for absolute figures. Instead, panel members are asked if activity has increased or decreased – a method that has proved remarkably accurate. “We have a unique little place in the world of macroeconomic research, and combined with the muscle of Markit, we will become very powerful,” said Mike Waterson, NTC chief executive.
1053;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-04-08T20:54:48Z;Post-Bear rally in credit derivatives stalls;;The recent rally in corporate credit derivatives stalled yesterday as investors drove up the cost of protecting companies’ debt against default for the first time in five days.The main iTraxx index of European investment grade companies added 7.4 basis points to 93.4bp, according to data from Markit Group, meaning the cost of protecting €10m of debt against default over five years rose to €93,400 a year.In the US meanwhile the CDX index was also wider, adding 4.6bp to 115bp by midday in new York.Both credit and equity markets retrenched from the strong rallies of recent days, which had continued the better tone since the US Federal Reserve-sponsored rescue of Bear Stearns and its support for other brokers.Bear’s potential collapse had pushed the cost of credit protection to record highs in mid-March, but this has since fallen by more than 40 per cent in the US and 45 per cent in Europe.However, credit analysts warned that this rally had shaky foundations, with trading volumes thin.Willem Sels at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The sharp improvement of sentiment …in the past week does not match the further deterioration of fundamentals. We think the positive tone is temporary.”The Fed’s determination not to let Bear Stearns fail reassured investors that financial meltdown as key counterparties collapsed would not be allowed.However, before the Fed’s move, the credit indices had been driven higher by leveraged hedge funds and “macro-hedgers” buying protection to hedge the portfolios. The relief that followed Bear’s rescue had then created a classic “short squeeze”, analysts said, where investors who had bought protection increasingly rushed to close out their positions and so help to drive down the cost of protection further.Meanwhile the price of cash bonds has barely budged, strategists point out, supporting the argument that the credit derivatives rally has little to do with perceptions of creditworthiness.Mehernosh Engineer, credit strategist at BNP Paribas, said: “We shouldn’t stop paying attention to credit derivatives but people need to realise that the market moves off very different dynamics to the cash market”.”It’s not so much that a single event has triggered the shift, but a realisation that we had a period of good performance without much real conviction - that couldn’t go on forever,” said Willem Sels, credit strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort.Opinions were divided on where credit derivatives would move from here. Mr Sels’ team bought protection on the iTraxx Europe at 92bp, betting the index would move significantly higher again.Mr Engineer was less sure: ”We could go to 75 or we could go to 100, it’s very difficult to predict. But cash will keep grinding wider as bank funding needs are significant, and cash is the real market.”
1054;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-04-07T19:58:45Z;Time to address counterparty risk;;"The near-collapse of Bear Stearns last month threatened catastrophe for the $45,000bn credit derivatives market as the reality of counterparty risk loomed large for the bank’s trading partners.While disaster was averted, the crisis galvanised regulators, policymakers and bankers to re-examine flaws in the market’s infrastructure and create safeguards against future crises.Three years and one credit crisis after regulators and policymakers first gathered together the leading credit derivatives operators to discuss such issues in 2005, concerns remain that the industry’s infrastructure has not kept pace with the rapid growth of the market.This time, however, regulators’ concerns are different. “The first time round, the discussions were mainly about the backlog of unconfirmed trades and some operational issues round assigning trades,” Larry Tabb, of advisory firm Tabb Group, says.“Now, the concerns are mostly round trade settlement and the need to automate processing.”The New York Federal Reserve, for instance, has put pressure on market participants to adopt electronic solutions to improve the speed and accuracy of over-the-counter derivatives processing.Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, in March criticised the inability of the industry to keep up with the rapid growth of the market and the increasing complexity of the traded instruments.Market participants – dealer banks, hedge funds and brokers – in recent weeks have made renewed commitments to adopt automated solutions and to reduce the errors and time lags associated with trade settlement. Dealers have committed to moving toward standardised cash settlement for trades, for example.However, further progress is still needed on some of the regulators’ initial concerns.For instance, many trades are still confirmed via e-mail, instant messaging or fax, which stymies attempts at automation and increases the likelihood of mistakes. “Even though bits of the market have been automated, we haven’t yet reached the stage where there’s an accepted, industry-wide standard,” Jeff Gooch, head of trade processing at Markit, says.Instead, there are a host of competing applications and platforms designed to address some of the market’s inefficiencies.Markit, for instance, competes with another industry incumbent, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), in the area of trade confirmations although the two organisations also offer complementary services.Mark Beeston, president of credit derivatives affirmation platform T-Zero, says some of the industry’s reluctance to embrace a single solution lies in the fact that no one platform has obtained the critical mass needed to bring the rest of the market to heel.“There are always early adopters but for many people before they invest in a system, they want to be sure it will be the winning technology,” Mr Beeston says.“And then there’s the network effect – people will naturally sign up faster to the platform when it can already demonstrate significant traction among dealers and brokers.”As a result, “we’re still nowhere near a homogeneous agreement or even a framework to get there,” Mr Tabb says.This piecemeal approach has attracted the criticism of regulators, most recently Mr Paulson.“We don’t need good ideas sitting on the shelf; we need good ideas put into practice,” Mr Paulson said in a recent speech. “[The] industry has taken some but not enough steps.”Still, neither the New York Federal Reserve nor the Treasury has offered explicit mandates on how best to meet the targets they have set.“We don’t want to pick a particular solution and we don’t want to say exactly how to get the automation done. We’re leaving that up to the market,” says one senior policymaker. Moreover, participants in the CDS markets have also run into legal difficulties.“The complexity of over-the-counter swaps on underlying corporate risk has definitely taxed the attorneys who draft the agreements,” analysts at CreditSights say.The dispute between Merrill Lynch and bond insurer XL Capital Assurance over credit insurance contracts worth up to $3.1bn is just one example of the potential for disagreement between CDS counterparties.But counterparty risk can take many forms, as the near-collapse of Bear Stearns demonstrated.In the over-the-counter CDS market, risk is concentrated in the hands and trading books of a few counterparties such as Bear Stearns.If Bear had defaulted, the market would have had to unravel the complex web of trades in which the broker was involved and to determine the settlement of contracts to be paid.“The industry understands that resolving these issues is important,” Markit’s Mr Gooch says. “The time is right to get more done.”"
1055;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-03-05T23:13:54Z;Hedge fund fears push up Libor rates;;Interbank rates were under fresh strain on Wednesday amid signs banks are hoarding cash because of fears of further hedge fund collapses.Three-month sterling interbank rates were fixed at 5.77 per cent while three-month Libor for the euro stood at 4.40 per cent.Sterling Libor has risen from 5.48 per cent on January 23, in spite of a subsequent cut in base rates, while euro Libor has risen from 4.33 per cent on February 8.In the US, three-month dollar Libor has fallen, but it still remains well above the expected Fed Funds rate, suggesting bankers view the outlook as extremely uncertain. The collapse of Focus Capital, the New York hedge fund, and the failure of Peloton Partners’ ABS fund have made banks increasingly reluctant to lend to hedge funds, pushing up lending costs.Several other funds specialising in credit are close to crisis, according to investors and consultants, while a few smaller funds have had assets seized by banks or have required rescues by investors or allies.Willem Sels, head of credit strategy at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The strains in the Libor market are to do with tighter liquidity conditions. The collapse of hedge funds [such as Focus and Peloton’s ABS fund] makes banks restrict liquidity.”However, the mood in the bond and credit default swaps market was less gloomy.Both Europe’s investment grade CDS iTraxx index and its US counterpart the CDX tightened to about 125bp and 163bp respectively on Wednesday on reports that Ambac, the bond insurer, was close to agreeing to a bank rescue plan. Both indices remain close to record highs.Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit, said: “There has been a bit of a rally in the market because of Ambac, but in the past few weeks there has been a structured bid with CPDOs [constant proportion debt obligations] having to unwind as the market hit certain levels. The monoline story and worries over hedge funds is also hanging over the market.”The new issue market also saw activity as British American Tobacco priced a €1.25bn ($1.9bn) seven-year fixed-rate bond at 180 basis points over mid-swaps and a £750m note at 270bp over gilts.Terence Shanahan, global head of debt capital market syndicate at SG CIB, said: “There was good demand for this paper with books well oversubscribed.“Investors have been starved of paper recently and this bond shows the European market is very much open. It is also significant as the pricing has been taken from the cash market rather than being compared with CDS prices, which have widened for technical reasons.”Mr Sels added: “In the bond markets, there are investors – insurance companies and pension funds for example – who want to put their money to work. They are happy to invest in companies with low fundamental risk.”
1056;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
1057;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-02-26T22:50:32Z;Relief as default protection costs fall;;Credit markets showed signs of relief yesterday with strong declines in the cost of protecting corporate debt against default.Even the primary new issue market came back to life.Sentiment lifted on Monday when the two largest bond insurers, MBIA and Ambac, retained their top ratings from Standard & Poor’s, driving a rally that cut credit derivatives spreads from the record peaks over recent weeks.This was followed on Tuesday by Moody’s confirming retention of MBIA’s triple-A rating.The iTraxx Europe main investment-grade index shed 18.5 basis points to 100bp, according to intra-day data from Markit, having shed 5.5bp late on Monday.This means it costs €24,000 less a year than it did at the start of the week to insure €10m of the index against default over five years.Other indices also improved. The iTraxx Crossover list of mostly junk-rated debt was down about 45.8bp over the week so far at 530.8bp, while the US CDX investment grade index has shed 19bp to 132bp.There have been green shoots in the bond markets in recent days with new issues from financial groups such as Allianz, Lloyds TSB, Barclays, National Australia Bank and GE Capital.Siddharth Prasad, of Merrill Lynch, which managed the €1.5bn Allianz deal with Citigroup and Dresdner Kleinwort, said people had been encouraged by a better tone in both the equity and credit markets and the apparent stabilisation in the monoline story.Bankers and analysts concede that there remains some way to go before investors believe they have true clarity from banks about their financial position and all the losses they might have to take from the market turmoil.Without this restoration of faith among investors and without a distinctly improved outlook for companies and the economy broadly, credit markets could continue to struggle.“Crossover [at] just 11bp tighter versus the previous night’s close highlights the market apprehension surrounding the outlook for credit,” said Suki Mann, at SG CIB.“And all this after perhaps the best possible news we could have expected as far as the monoline industry was concerned, with the affirmation of MBIA’s AAA rating.”Willem Sels at Dresdner Kleinwort said: “We believe the technicals remain negative, especially in the lower-rated end of the market, where hedge fund redemptions – or the anticipation thereof – are weighing on the market.”
1058;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-02-21T18:42:50Z;OTC daily pricing planned for this year;;Six leading investment banks and data-provider Markit plan to launch a daily pricing service for fund managers who invest in over-the-counter derivative and bond markets.Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and UBS, which are among the 16 banks that own stakes in Markit, have all signed up to provide data, which will be combined with Markit’s own valuations.Regulators and credit market participants are stepping up efforts to improve transparency in derivatives markets, where trades are private rather than through regulated exchanges.Markit said yesterday it had talked with regulators for the past few months, though work began on the product a year ago.“As markets have got more volatile, there’s a lot more emphasis on being able to value things quickly. People also need to be very sure of the positions they have,” said Jeff Gooch, head of valuations and trade processing at Markit.Banks currently send fund managers their daily valuations in different formats, Markit said, making it complicated and time-consuming for funds to work out their daily net asset values.Under Markit’s system, fund managers will be able to compare dealer valuations with its own independent numbers.“It’s going to be a hygiene factor – something you can stamp onto your books to show this is all accurate and auditable,” Mr Gooch said.Markit plans to launch the platform in the second half of this year focusing on bonds and derivatives. But it aims to expand the service to include all other major cash and derivative asset classes, including structured products such as cash and synthetic CDOs, which are notoriously hard to price.The company trialled the system last summer with two hedge funds and two asset managers.
1059;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-02-20T19:32:07Z;Fresh credit market turmoil;;Credit markets were thrown into fresh turmoil on Wednesday as the cost of protecting the debt of US and European companies against default surged to all-time highs.The sharp jump, which rivalled the sell-off at the height of last summer’s credit market turmoil, came as traders rushed to unwind highly leveraged positions in complex structured products.The sell-off was triggered partly by fears of more unwinding to come as investors rushed to exit before conditions worsen. As losses have snowballed, further unwinding has been triggered.“There’s a domino effect taking place,” said Mehernosh Engineer, credit strategist at BNP Paribas.The cost of insuring the debt of the 125 investment-grade companies in the benchmark iTraxx Europe rose more than 20 per cent to as high as 136.9 basis points, before closing at 126.5bp. That compares with a level of about 51bp at the start of the year, according to data from Markit Group.This means buyers of protection through so-called credit default swaps are paying €126,500 ($185,780) annually to insure €10m worth of debt over five years.In the US, the situation was just as bad with the investment grade CDX index hitting a record wide of 165.5bp in morning trade – more than double its level at the start of the year.The iTraxx Crossover index, which covers mainly junk-rated European debt, bust through the 600bp barrier – up from 343bp at the start of the year. The moves are expected to affect the cost of raising new debt in the bond markets. Credit default swaps act as a proxy for the amounts real companies have to pay to borrow in the bond markets.The way CDS spreads influence real borrowing costs has been illustrated this week by the situation at Credit Suisse.Investors who had agreed to buy a bond from the Swiss bank the day before it announced unexpected writedowns are already looking to renegotiate price terms after the news sent its CDS contracts higher.One funding manager at a different European bank believes the influence of CDS prices is a case of the tail wagging the dog.“We feel we’re being unfairly penalised by the CDS market right now. It directly influences your cost of borrowing because investors up till now have wanted a return over CDS for any bonds issued,” he said.The opacity of credit derivatives markets has contributed to problems. While most analysts and traders believe unwinding is taking place, few are sure of how much or by whom.
1060;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-02-08T21:20:57Z;Overview: US recession fears grip financial markets;;Renewed fears of a US recession gripped financial markets this week, driving down global equities, sending credit spreads to record levels and boosting short-dated government bonds.Weak service sector data and broadly disappointing corporate earnings in the US and Europe set the tone for the week’s trading, with ongoing worries about the outlook for bond insurers heightening the gloomy mood.A 25 basis point cut in UK interest rates and hints from the European Central Bank that it would cut its growth forecasts – paving the way for lower eurozone rates – failed to soothe investors’ concerns.Credit markets came under the spotlight on Friday as talk that a European fund was liquidating a structured credit product added to fears that economic slowdown would lead to companies defaulting on their debt.The Markit iTraxx Europe index – a gauge of the cost of insuring against corporate default – hit a lifetime high of 98.75 while the CDX North America investment grade index touched 133. The iTraxx crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits – an important barometer of risk appetite – widened to a record 530.It was a miserable week for equity markets. On Friday in New York, the S&P 500 index closed down 4.6 per cent over the five days, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 4.5 per cent.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 3.8 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London declined 4.1 per cent. Much of Asia was spared from the week’s sell-off because of market closures due to the Lunar New Year holiday. However, the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo fell 3.6 per cent – taking its fall since the start of the year to 15 per cent – and Australian stocks shed 3.2 per cent.The euro was the chief focus in the currency markets as it suffered its biggest weekly decline against the dollar for 18 months.The dramatic fall came as the European Central Bank appeared to give way to mounting pressure to soften its stance on interest rates.“A new dawn has broken for European rates,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns.“The ECB has U-turned on policy intentions and is sending out messages that weaker growth has now taken over from inflation as the number one priority.“The market is now on ECB rate cut watch and the eurozone government debt curve should continue to pile on more steepening pressure.”Investment bank Merrill Lynch took a different view. “We doubt that the ECB will cut rates over the forecasting horizon, given that the policy stance is in our judgment neutral, that there is practically no output gap, that inflation risks are on the upside and that money and especially credit continue to grow strongly,” it said in a research note.Government bonds had a volatile week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury experienced its biggest one-day rise since 2004 on Thursday as investors gave a poor response to an auction of 30-year paper.Although the 10-year yield eased back slightly on Friday as credit market turmoil prompted safe-haven buying, it was still up 5bp over the week at 3.65 per cent.That compares with a 4½-year low of 3.29 per cent on January 23, the day after the Fed Reserve’s emergency 75bp rate cut.But shorter-dated bonds were pushed higher in both the US and Europe on expectations of lower interest rates.The two-year Treasury yield fell 15bp to 1.94 per cent – taking the gap between the two and 10-year yields to its widest since September 2004.In Europe, the yield on the two-year Schatz tumbled 29bp to 3.09 per cent and the two-year UK gilt yield shed 27bp to 4.05 per cent.In commodities, platinum hit a record $1,875 an ounce as it continued to defy gravity amid persistent worries about the impact of South Africa’s energy crisis on supplies of the metal.Oil and gold edged higher but failed to retest their recent highs, although copper climbed to its highest for nearly three months.Agricultural commodities were strong, with wheat, corn and soyabean prices hitting records.
1061;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2008-01-21T23:13:25Z;Banking group sells off Project Boat;;The investment banking consortium behind Project Boat has sold the trade reporting service – created to break the monopoly held by Europe’s big exchanges – less than three months after its much-vaunted launch.The early sale raises questions about the future of a similar investment banking venture in the exchange industry, Project Turquoise, which aims to establish a trading platform in European equities to rival the London Stock Exchange, among others.Markit, the company that manages Project Boat, is to buy it for an undisclosed sum. Bankers said management issues, in particular technology-related projects outside their core skills, were one reason for exiting.“We are not good at managing technology-based companies and we wanted to make sure that there was someone there who really understood data, which is one of the most important parts of our business,” said one banker.Markit, a data distribution and trade processing service itself owned by a consortium of investment banks, declined to comment. Talks about a sale are understood to have been under way since late December.Trade reporting opened up to competition with November’s introduction of the markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid).This requires all equity trades to be published once executed. In markets such as London, where post-trade publication requirements have been in effect for some time, brokers and banks have had little option but to pay the established stock exchange to publish their trades.Project Boat was set up in September 2006 by ABN Amro, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS. It has captured 68 per cent of trade reporting conducted off-exchange in Europe and roughly a quarter of the region’s equity trades, according to people close to the venture.“We think we have almost fulfilled our main objective, which was to break the monopoly of the exchanges,” the banker said.Markit was formed in 2001 to collect and disseminate prices of credit default swaps traded by investment banks, and to provide greater transparency to what was then an evolving market.
1062;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cost of protecting corporate debt soars;;"Escalating fears of a recession drove the cost of protecting corporate debt against default to a record high in the US on Wednesday.A similar benchmark in Europe returned to levels not seen since the peak of the upheaval last August.The moves continue the trend since the beginning of the year, with credit default swaps (CDS) rapidly increasing in price as investors scramble to protect themselves from the risk of corporate defaults.“It’s been a nasty start to the year,” said Martin Barnaby, credit strategist at Merrill Lynch. “The macro environment is souring quicker than we thought. The pessimism in the market is deep and ingrained.”In the US, an index of investment-grade debt jumped to an all-time high of 102.5 basis points, Deutsche Bank data show. This means it costs $102,500 to protect a $10m portfolio of investment grade US corporate debt.The iTraxx Crossover index, which represents the cost of insuring risky, mostly junk-rated, European corporate debt, has surged 60 basis points since the beginning of 2008 to 403bp on Wednesday, a series high.It now costs €403,000 ($591,000) annually to protect €10m worth of Crossover debt against default over five years – €60,000 more than on January 1.“The market is driven by fundamentals, by fears of a US recession. It has been the worst start to a year since the indices began,” said Gavan Nolan, analyst at derivative data provider Markit.Investor hopes that the CDS market would have begun to recover from the credit crisis have been dashed, although European and US companies remain fundamentally strong and profitable.That is because if
macroeconomic conditions worsen, companies are likely to become less able to service their debt.Moody’s, the ratings agency, says default rates
on junk-rated corporate
debt will increase fivefold to 4.8 per cent this year.Still, analysts say credit traders have yet to accept such a gloomy scenario, particularly since defaults hit a 26-year low in December.Willem Sels, head of credit strategy at Dresdner Kleinwort, said markets have yet to price in the potential for two “self-destructing spirals of confidence: that of a US recession and that of a new default cycle”.“Corporates do not operate in a vacuum. Although the US housing market crisis
led to a crisis of liquidity in past months, non-financial corporate bonds have not been affected much,” he said. “We do not think that this is sustainable.”"
1063;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-11-23T02:37:34Z;Broad sovereign debt sell-off;;Investors are shunning European government debt issued by countries other than Germany as worries about a global economic slowdown prompt a flight to safety within Europe.“There is a strong sell-off in sovereign debt relative to [German] bunds, ranging from top-rated Spain to eastern Europe,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, strategist at SG CIB.“Credit spreads, derivatives, and currencies are all taking a whack as part of the flight to quality.”Steven Major, head of fixed-income strategy at HSBC, added: “This is as much to do with price rises of German bonds, based on safe-haven flows, as it is to do with selling of others.”Government bonds from Germany, which is seen by investors as the most fiscally responsible and safest, have seen prices jump in recent days, helping to push the risk premium lower and increasing the spread between them and bonds of other European nations.Meanwhile risk premiums have risen sharply for bonds from Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Iceland.For instance, the spread of Greek and Spanish 10-year bonds over 10-year German bunds have risen 3 basis points in the past two days, while that up 10-year Hungarian bonds over 10-year German bunds have climbed 4bp. While the swings are not large, they are unusual, compared with movements in the past.Mr Major points out there are additional factors contributing to the underperformance of some countries, including worries about the housing market in Spain and political uncertainty in Belgium.Meanwhile, in the credit derivatives market, the cost of protecting the debt of many governments in Europe against default has risen sharply.“The changes in the eurozone names have been small in absolute terms but big in percentage,” said Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit.For example, the five-year credit default swaps, a kind of insurance against default, of both Belgium and Ireland have doubled since the beginning of October, according to data from Markit. Belgium’s CDS has moved from 4bp to 8bp and Ireland’s CDS from 5bp to 10bp.
1064;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-11-02T02:27:11Z;CDS traders warn of ‘blood on streets’;;The mood in credit derivatives markets turned ugly on Thursday, with the cost of insuring corporate debt hitting multi-week highs on both sides of the Atlantic.Speculation was rife that leading major investment banks were facing additional losses linked to complex mortgage-backed securities, while worries mounted over the health of major financial guarantors.“It’s scary out there — there’s blood on the streets,” a trader at a US brokerage said. “It’s a real mess.”In the US, the perceived risk of owning corporate debt jumped to a seven-week high, with the cost to insure a $10m portfolio of investment-grade debt reaching $67,000, data from Phoenix Partners Group showed.Confidence in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, as measured by their credit default swaps, slumped to lows not seen since the height of the credit squeeze in August.Five-year credit default swaps tied to Citigroup widened to 60 basis points, meaning it cost $60,000 annually to insure Citigroup’s debt against default for five years. A couple of weeks ago, that figure stood at $27,000.Contracts on Merrill Lynch, which last week posted the largest quarterly loss in its 93-year history, rose $18,000 to $103,000. CDS on UBS rose 10bp to 51bp, Deutsche Bank said. The contracts stood at about 6bp in May. Contracts on Credit Suisse rose 4bp to 52bp from 10bp in June.Bond insurers, or monolines, were also hit hard.“[These triple-A rated companies are] exposed to the crumbling housing market,” said Gavan Nolan, an analyst at derivatives data provider Markit. “Investors in monolines will be waiting for the coming months of housing data with trepidation,” Mr Nolan said.CDS on MBIA Insurance rocketed to a four-year high, of 345bp, CMA Datavision said.Last week the insurer posted $36.6m net loss and halted its share buy-back programme.Contracts on the bond insurance unit of Ambac Financial climbed to a five-year high of 310bp.Gimme Credit, an independent research term, downgraded both MBIA and Ambac this week.In Europe, the iTraxx Crossover index of 50 mostly high-yield companies widened by 18 bp to 338bp, the biggest rise since August, according to Deutsche Bank data.The iTraxx Europe index, which tracks 125 investment-grade companies, rose 3.75bp to 41bp. It was the biggest one-day jump since early September.
1065;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-10-26T14:37:14Z;Doubts emerge over guarantors’ creditworthiness;;The perceived creditworthiness of two of the largest financial guarantors in the US on Thursday plunged to lows not seen since the worst of the credit squeeze in August.MBIA and AMBAC are specialist companies that guarantee the repayment of bond principal and interest in the event of an issuer default - including bonds backed by subprime assets.After both companies this week reported third-quarter losses, investors have begun to speculate that the monolines, as they are known, might themselves default on their outstanding debt.Spreads on five-year credit default swaps written on Ambac’s debt widened by 50 basis points to 300bp, according to Credit Derivatives Research, an independent data provider.In other words, the annual cost of insuring a $10m portfolio of Ambac’s debt over five years has risen by $50,000 to $300,000. The previous record of $238,000 was set on August 16, according to data from Markit.Ambac, the world’s second-largest bond insurer, on Wednesday reported its first-ever quarterly loss after reducing the value of subprime mortgage-linked securities by $743m.Meanwhile, spreads on MBIA - which on Thursday reported a $36.6m loss of its own - jumped 42bp to206bp, according to CMA Datavision. MBIA’s CDS had previously peaked at 201bp in August.Chuck Chaplin, MBIA’s chief financial officer, told investors the company would halt its share buyback programme as it needs to conserve capital, sparking concerns further asset markdowns might be ahead.Michael Cox, real estate and corporate securitisation analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said spread widening probably reflected investors’ fears over the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on structured credit instruments, particularly after Merrill Lynch’s recorded writedowns on Wednesday.”While we see the CDS levels as too wide on fundamentals, they do tend to track sentiment,” he said. ”Overall, we continue to believe that the monolines have manageable exposure to problem areas of credit and that all would act to shore up balance sheets if ratings appeared under threat, tapping the equity markets or shareholders if necessary.”
1066;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-09-26T23:23:51Z;Reuters and Markit in swaps transparency deal;;"The level of transparency in the global credit derivatives market is set to rise following a deal between Reuters and Markit Group, a third-party data provider.The deal will offer intra-day pricing of credit default swaps to the estimated 100,000 regular users of Reuters terminals for the first time, giving this information to a much broader pool of investors than before.The credit derivatives market has recently enjoyed a startling pace of growth, but the expansion has provoked unease because the sector has traditionally been relatively opaque, making it hard for investors to track prices in a timely manner.Markit has been gathering data on the over-the-counter credit derivatives market
for some time, and disseminating it to clients.The deal means a wider pool of investors can see regular prices on instruments such as credit default swaps, which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt.“The CDS market to a great extent is driving other markets, in particular equities,” said Andrew Hausman, Global Head of Fixed Income at Reuters. “Stock prices are moving on credit default prices.”"
1067;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
1068;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-08-10T16:58:42Z;On Wall St: Fear rather than fundamentals is driving trading;;When investors begin to lose their nerve, a virtuous circle can quickly become a vicious one.Banks and brokers have had an uncomfortable reminder of that lesson in recent weeks amid growing fears of mortgage-related losses and a broader credit crunch. After basking in the glow of several years of easy credit, strong capital markets and record deal volumes, financial sector shares have tumbled and the cost of insuring bank debt against default has spiked higher.Investors are worried about the banks for a number of reasons, not the least of which is their exposure to the crisis in the US subprime mortgage business.As more mortgage losses float to the surface in banks and investment funds across the US and Europe, US regulators are now scrutinising the books of some top Wall Street brokers and investment banks. They are looking closely at whether the companies are calculating the value of complex and rarely-traded assets in a consistent way, for their own books and for the books of clients such as hedge funds.Meanwhile, many of the larger banks have sizeable capital markets operations and could be stuck holding the debt of leveraged buy-outs that they have agreed to underwrite, but cannot find buyers for in volatile markets. There are $300bn worth of such deals slated for sale by the end of the year.The S&P financials index has lost more than 9 per cent so far this year. Investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers have been the hardest hit. They are down by 33 and 25 per cent respectively.And of the 2,500 companies monitored by Markit Group, financial institutions account for 47 of the 50 names whose cost of default protection increased proportionately the most in the past month. Of these, 40 were banks.The annual cost of insuring Bear’s investment grade-rated debt against default has moved as high as 210 basis points in recent weeks, and was at 130bp yesterday. That is almost twice the cost of insuring an index of US companies rated investment grade.This week, banks even showed signs of losing confidence in each other as the cost of overnight lending between banks soared, prompting the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and others to step in with infusions of liquidity to keep lending markets on an even keel.But conventional wisdom suggests that investment banking professionals should be sophisticated risk managers, able to correctly value their assets, and carefully manage their liabilities. After all, many of the complex financial instruments at the root of current problems were designed, marketed and sold by the investment banks themselves. On that basis the sell-off in the financial sector could be a buying opportunity.The problem is that the current turmoil is now rooted in fear rather than fundamentals.Banks rely on investor confidence in the system. Now that confidence has been shaken in the risk management abilities of sophisticated players such as Bear – which has seen the collapse of two of its mortgage-related hedge funds and problems at a third – investors are worried about what else they don’t yet know.Kevin Logan, US economist at Dresdner Kleinwort, says: “Investors are less afraid of the bodies floating to the surface than they are of the ones they still can’t see beneath the waves.”Capitalia, a small Italian bank, has been among those to suffer from this fear of the unknown. Despite its acquisition by UniCredito and the absence of any known exposure to US problems, the cost of protecting Capitalia’s debt against default is more than five times what it was a month ago.But the importance of perception is perhaps best illustrated by the way investors treated Bear after it held a conference call aimed at calming fears over its liquidity position.Comments by Sam Molinaro, chief financial officer, led to a further slide in the bank’s share price after he said credit market conditions were as bad as he had seen in 22 years, adding that Bear would not buy back any shares because of the need to preserve liquidity.With any luck, the fundamentals will prevail. But the longer fear dominates the markets, the greater the chance it has of becoming self-fulfilling.
1069;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-08-06T14:49:01Z;Credit markets outlook;;"Credit markets are in turmoil. Rising defaults on US subprime mortgages - home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories – have forced dozens of lenders to close, and caused market mayhem.Gavan Nolan, research analyst at Markit Group, the independent data provider that supplies prices for the iTraxx credit index family, answered your questions in a live debate on Monday from 2pm BST.………………………………………………………………………………………………………How do you think commodities will be affected by the recent volatility in credit markets?
LeiGavan Nolan: The commodities markets tend to have little correlation with other asset classes, so in theory the volatility in credit shouldn’t have a meaningful effect. The supply/ demand imbalance due to the surging Chinese economy should ensure that prices in hard commodities are supported. It is also possible that gold and other precious metals could benefit from a flight to quality. A credit crunch could make capital investment more expensive and squeeze refining capacity .………………………………………………………………………………………………………Is the UK housing credit market any less vulnerable than the US?
David Immanuel, LondonGavan Nolan: I think the UK housing market is less vulnerable than the US. The sub-prime sector is still in its infancy in the UK, whereas sub-prime and ALT-A make up around 20 per cent of the total US mortgage market. It also doesn’t suffer from the oversupply of housing that some areas of the US suffer from (quite the contrary). Having said that, the UK, along with Spain, is one of the most highly stretched in Europe on affordability and income multiples.The effects of rising interest rates haven’t fully emerged, and a rise to 6 per cent this year, as predicted by the futures market, would put house prices under serious pressure. It’s also worth pointing out that the London housing market is largely driven by foreign money and the affluence of financial workers. If the City entered a downturn, then the housing market could follow.………………………………………………………………………………………………………How likely is the credit market risk in the US likely to spread to Global equities and also to debt-based investments. In particular, do you think contagion will reach Asia-Pacific and Australasia?
Michael Walker, Auckland, New ZealandGavan Nolan: Equities have already been severely affected by problems in the credit markets. Volatility is at its highest level for some time, and was primarily stoked by the sub-prime crisis. This triggered a reappraisal of risk. This has a direct effect on equities through the appetite for Leveraged Buyouts. Private equity groups have helped fuel the rally in equities by borrowing huge sums to fund takeovers. However, a number of banks have been left with large leveraged loan positions on their balance sheets after they were unable to place the debt in the secondary markets. It will now be very difficult for private equity to finance buyouts on the favourable terms seen in the last couple of years.The contagion will reach Asia and Australasia as financial markets are now highly interdependent. The effect on the yen carry trade could also be factor. Volatility in interest rates and exchange rates could make the trade less attractive and lead to outflows from countries with high rates, such as New Zealand.………………………………………………………………………………………………………With US mortgage resets having been only $197bn in the six month period ending June 30 2007, set to rise to $318bn in the six month period to December 2007, and, then rising further to a level of $511bn in the six month period to Jun 30 2008 - do you feel that the market has already adjusted sufficiently to take into account such a rapid escalation of future mortgage debt-servicing costs due to such future resets? Indeed have you factored this information into your analysis at Markit? Also - from your knowledge and experience what percentage of funds out there would you say have now truly marked to market - and how many instead still mark to model/formula?
Mike Small, DubaiGavan Nolan: Yes, I agree that the sheer volume of mortgage resets will have a major impact on spreads. The poor quality of the late 2005 and 2006 vintage will start to become clear in the coming months as foreclosures rise. Many investors are pinning their hopes on loan modifications. This has already started to happen. However, this could be problematic on a large scale.Falling house prices could mean that it makes more sense for the lender to foreclose rapidly and cut their losses rather than modify the loan. We can expect more pain for sub-prime loan servicers and this likely to affect financial spreads across the board. Whether this affects the wider economy will depend on whether banks retrench and cause a genuine credit crunch. The effect on consumer spending from falling house prices will also be a major factor. However, research from the Bank of England shows that the correlation between house prices and consumer spending is not as strong as previously thought, at least in the UK.On the percentage of funds marking-to-market, I think this is one of the most important questions at the moment. It is impossible to place a figure, but there are still significant amounts of funds marking-to-model. This will become more apparent when more hedge funds unwind. Many are still calculating their valuations for the second quarter, and having difficulty doing so, due to the illiquidity of much of their investments. Use of skilled third-party valuations specialists in now even more crucial, a fact highlighted by the FSA in its Financial Stability report.………………………………………………………………………………………………………There seems to have been a broad failure of the ratings companies in the US to properly downgrade assets (e.g. CDOs) based on home mortgages. Do you think this gap in credibility will continue? What needs to happen for people to get a clear re-assessment of financial risks for these investment vehicles?
Pete, CaliforniaGavan Nolan: I agree that the ratings agencies credibility has taken a knock on CDOs. They belatedly took action some weeks ago and there is no doubt further downgrades to come. There now seems to be a clear distinction between a AAA rating on corporates/ sovereigns and a AAA rating on a structured security, i.e. one has credibility and the latter is now in question. I don’t think there is an easy answer to this. The rating agencies might have to completely reassess their models and try and stop arrangers from arbitraging their ratings.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Do you think the subprime/credit turbulence is likely to negatively affect the value of a US based bond fund that holds a lot of mortgage backed securities and AAA-BBB corporate bonds (70 per cent or so of holdings)? US Treasuries make up only about 10 per cent of the holdings of this mutual fund.
Bret Larimer, Denver, Colorado, USGavan Nolan: I don’t know the exact composition of your fund, but I would think itprobably already has been negatively affected by the current turbulence. The performance of the mortgage-backed securities would depend on the underlying collateral, but if it is AAA prime then should have held up relatively well. However, spreads on investment grade bonds have widened considerably in recent weeks, particularly in the financial sector. In fact, nearly all sectors have deteriorated, so performance on the fund might well have suffered.………………………………………………………………………………………………………The average banking stock is approximately at the level of mid 2002. Is there a buying opportunity here?
John Dewit, UKGavan Nolan: According to our data, the average single A financial credit is still some way off mid-2002 levels. I think the important fact is the dispersion within the sector. Broker-dealers such as Bear Stearns and Lehman have obviously widened considerably due to their direct exposure to US sub-prime. Deutsche Bank recently surprised some with their solid results. They were on the right-side of sub-prime, which shows that the effects of the contagion are unpredictable.The sector will almost certainly face further volatility in the coming months with more bad news from sub-prime emerging. An escalation of hedge funds is also expected and this could hurt banks with prime brokerage businesses. IKB’s recent ABS losses also shows that risk is now dispersed throughout the financial system. Overall, the widening in some names could be an overshoot and it would probably be wise to steer clear of banks with significant - and known - ABS exposure.………………………………………………………………………………………………………How large is the CDO market? Can you summarise the profile of its investor base? What percentage of underlying assets are subprime RMBS?
Raymond Wong, Hong KongGavan Nolan: The CDO investor base is largely determined by the rating of the tranche. Banks are the largest participants in AAA and AA tranches, with monoline insurers also very active. Further down the capital structure fast money investors are the main players. Hedge funds are the largest investors in equity tranches, or ”toxic waste” as they are sometimes known. Pension funds are also active.In terms of total size it is difficult to come up with an accurate figure, but JPMorgan estimate that notionals for US mezzanine ABS CDOs and high grade ABS CDOs are $128bn so far this year. The total amount for this year is likely to be lower than $300bn in 2006. The proportion of ABS CDOs as a percentage of the total CDO universe is also likely to decline.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Could you please share your views on the outlook for the US subprime market and the enlarging spread yield these days?
William, Hong KongGavan Nolan: The outlook for the US sub-prime market appears bleak. The ABX BBB- index, which reflects movements in sub-prime CDS of ABS, has plummetedin recent months and is now at a record low. Several lenders have filed for bankruptcy and Countrywide, the largest mortgage lender in the US, was forced to issue a statement confirming it had adequate liquidity. The unfortunate bullish investors in the sector, however, are unlikely to see things improve this year.The loans originated in late 2005 and 2006 were of particularly bad quality. Many are Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) and are due to reset this year. A significant amount of borrowers could only afford the mortgages on the low fixed rate given for the initial two years. The rise in rates since then will mean that they will face considerably higher repayments. Foreclosures are already high and are likely to go even higher as homeowners are hit by the double whammy of higher rates and falling house prices. Indeed, there are already signs that the downturn is going beyond subprime and Alt-A and affecting better quality borrowers.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Is the current turbulence just a market over reaction or is it the beginning of a bear market? What will the effect of the current market turbulence have on corporate bonds?
Peter Koh, ItalyGavan Nolan: The current market turbulence was triggered by the sub-prime crisis in the US. This led to a broader repricing of risk as investors reassessed the LBO boom of recent years. Liquidity has been readily available and the concomitant growth of the leveraged loan market fuelled the private equity sector and led to takeover structures becoming more and more risky. I think the large covenant-lite loans and PIK bonds are unlikely to return on any significant scale in the foreseeable future. Whether this is a true bear market is another matter.Fundamentals are still relatively strong and corporate balance sheets are robust compared to the 2001/2002 downturn. It will depend on whether the travails of the financial sector spill over into the real economy. This could happen in two ways. The losses in sub-prime and the overhang from a huge pipeline of LBOs could cause a real credit crunch. We’re not quite there yet, as credit is being denied to largely risky borrowers. But the recent margin calls on mortgage lenders with prime borrowers suggest this could escalate. The other mechanism is the effect on household spending. Consumers have been fairly resilient in the face of falling house prices but this may not continue. The construction sector will also suffer as homebuilders run into further difficulties.Most of the headlines regarding the credit markets have focused on the iTraxx and CDX indices, and rightly so. They are the most efficient vehicles for taking short positions and hence should reflect the scale of the correction. However, the fact that the investment grade indices have widened more than the high-yield suggests that much of the movement is driven by technical hedging activity. Corporate bonds have widened but not as much as CDS. This partly reflects the relative ease of going short via CDS as compared to bonds. The issuance of bonds at the moment is difficult due to the hostile debt conditions, and a number of high-yield offers have already been pulled. Issuers are likely to find the market unreceptive to risky structures.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Do you believe that the introduction of new governmental policies and innovative conceptual ideas in the field of mortgage re-financing can help us to avoid the spread of existing American problems in credit markets on the global scale? Could you please let us know your point of view on the possible remedy to solve the volatility related crisis in capital markets?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineGavan Nolan: I generally think governments should ony interfere in markets when it is absolutely necessary. A prime example was the US savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The scale of the losses (estimated at $150bn) and the obvious threat to the real economy necessitated government action. I don’t think the current sub-prime problems are near that level. In any case, coordinated supra-national state intervention would be very difficult from a practical perspective given the different structures of mortgage markets across the globe and the political obstacles.I’m of the opinion that the financial markets are more than capable of managing this risk effectively. The advent of structured credit (CDOs, etc.) has helped diversify credit exposure geographically and across different classes of investors. Having said that, the losses suffered by IKB recently show that market participants need to have adequate risk management and product control infrastructures. National regulators, especially in some of the smaller, less mature countries, need to be aware of the pitfalls of investors becoming involved in financial products that require sophisticated understanding.BackgroundMr Nolan is responsible for producing commentary and analysis on the credit markets.

1070;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-07-31T20:07:41Z;Synthetic CDOs fall from grace;;"Amid the recent turmoil in credit derivatives markets, one question has been nagging at many participants: why have the investment-grade indices performed worse than their riskier, lower-rated cousins?In any normal bear market, it is natural to expect that the value of riskier assets plummets faster, or in the case of credit derivatives, the risk premium leaps more sharply.However, in both the European iTraxx and US CDX indices of credit default swaps, which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of debt by a basket of companies, this has not been the case over the past month.In Europe, the main iTraxx index of 125 investment-grade companies has seen its cost of protection leap 62 per cent, according to data from Markit Group.This compares with a rise of 49 per cent for the Cross-over list of mostly junk-rated companies, which is seen as the barometer of general investor appetite for credit and is often the most widely traded index.For the US indices, the pattern is the same, although less extreme. The main index jumped 46 per cent, while the Crossover rose 41 per cent.Such a strange outcome has prompted rumours that issues of a relatively new type of complex structured product, known as a constant proportion debt obligation, have run into difficulties and are being forced to unwind. This would make them buy back large amounts of index protection, which would help to drive up the cost.These CPDOs have prompted wide debate since they first appeared last summer. They are essentially highly leveraged bets on the investment-grade indices, but still managed to qualify for the safest AAA ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.Talk has focused particularly on deals from ABN Amro, which was the first and has been by far the largest public issuer of CPDOs. However, the bank strenuously denies this is the case with their first deal programme, called Surf, or any since.Andrew Feachem at ABN said: “We can say categorically that the Surf CPDO transactions are not unwinding. There is a lot of room in those trades.”Instead, he believes that the strong moves in investment-grade indices are more likely to have their root in the hedging activities of banks that run synthetic collateralised debt obligations.These products create slices of risk out of investment-grade derivatives that are tailored to individual investors’ tastes.According to research from JPMorgan, issuance of synthetic CDOs tumbled in July to record one of their weakest ever months.Such products normally thrive on higher spread levels in the derivatives markets because this allows bankers to earn more from hedging them while still paying decent returns to investors.This has resulted in synthetic CDOs commonly providing a limit on credit derivative spread widening, something that has been strangely absent recently.Part of this is likely due to investor appetite for such deals when markets remain so volatile. Mark Kiesel, portfolio manger at Pimco, said: “We’re very much in a market driven by fear.”However, that same volatility means those banks that construct and sell such deals are less keen on selling new synthetic CDOs. This is for two reasons: first, those managing the banks’ exposure are heavily caught up in hedging and rehedging their positions as the markets move; and second, it is less easy to predict what exactly the bank will earn from each deal until it closes.As one London-based analyst said: “It is not much fun to execute deals in this market – you don’t want to be going to your boss and saying that between agreeing and closing a deal you’ve just lost most of your carry [or annual profit] over a 10-year trade.”This could help to explain the moves in the investment-grade indices, which banks use as a hedging short cut.Widening spreads force them to buy more protection, thus pushing spreads wider still. At the same time, new deals are not selling protection on a scale large enough to support the market."
1071;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-07-09T22:32:11Z;Markit pricing will shine light on derivatives;;The transparency of global credit derivatives markets is set to improve with the provision of independent pricing throughout the day from Markit Group, the third-party data provider.The company will announce on Tuesday that it is launching Markit Quote, which will be the first real-time price quote service in the over-the-counter market for credit default swaps, which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt.The move is significant because it will shine more light onto the OTC trading of credit derivatives where contract values can be fairly opaque because, unlike with stock markets, there is no central exchange, or “board”, that shows the progress of market activity.This fact leaves asset managers such as hedge funds and other investors in debt markets dependent upon their investment bank dealers for price quotes and means they have to sift through a flood of offers before finding a best price.“Markit Quotes is designed to optimise the way in which our clients manage often overwhelming amounts of incoming information,” said Kevin Gould, head of data products and analytics at the company. “It allows them to monitor intra-day activity with ease.”The service is in addition to the end-of-day “dirty”pricing and “cleaned” next-day pricing that Markit already provides and where it competes with other providers such as Bloomberg-CMA.The service is based on software that extracts indicative and live prices from dealer pricing runs and converts them into real-time data, allowing portfolio managers and traders to cut through the hundreds of electronic messages they receive daily to gain an immediate view of market levels, the company said.It has been in testing with a number of clients since last year and some of those involved said they had found it useful. The service will cover bonds, CDS, credit and structured finance indices, index tranches and loan CDS. The company said it would add coverage of loans, convertible bonds and structured finance securities in the coming months.
1072;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-06-07T21:25:21Z;More banks on board with Boat;;Project Boat, the consortium set up to compete with Europe’s exchanges in data provision, on Thursday announced that five more large banks have agreed to provide trading data to it, giving it critical mass in the reporting of off-market trades.The service competes directly with a similar service offered by the London Stock Exchange, which has announced average price reductions for those reporting trades to it of more than 80 per cent.Those reductions are set to take place on November 1, coinciding with new European regulations, known as Mifid, which aim to promote competition. It also coincides with the target launch date of Project Boat.Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, Dresdner Kleinwort, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Scotland have chosen Boat as the mechanism that will satisfy their pre-trade and post-trade reporting requirements under Mifid. The five join the nine founding banks behind the project as well as several others that have asked that their names not be disclosed.Project Boat intends to sell the data in real time to individual providers and to third-party data providers such as Reuters and Thomson.Analysts are unclear about the exact impact that Boat will have on revenues and profits at European exchanges. But according to a new study by Celent, a consultancy firm, the LSE and OMX, the exchange which serves the Nordic region, will both suffer. OMX earns the highest percentage of revenue from the sale of market data of any European exchange.Last month, Clara Furse, the LSE’s chief executive, said she understood the group would charge £82 a month per screen for the data, “which, by our own calculation, is worth £3.50”. However, the LSE said the loss of trade reporting revenue would have “very little impact”.Markit, a provider of data, portfolio valuations and derivatives trade processing selected to run Project Boat, said it would receive trade reporting data from banks representing 60 per cent to 65 per cent of European off-market trading.
1073;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-05-25T15:45:40Z;Continuing rapid growth in deals stretches technological resources;;The explosion in derivatives trading in recent years – particularly in credit – initially left the market’s trade processing capacity behind.Then, in September 2005, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in pioneering co-operation with other US and European regulators, knocked together the heads of 14 big dealer firms, warning of the risks to financial stability if unconfirmed trades and unverified paperwork continued to pile up.The result was an unprecedented industry-wide push that saw a sharp reduction in backlogs, an increase in automation and a smartening up of lax market practices. A year later the New York Fed felt enough had been done to divert some attention to similar problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) equity derivatives market.Yet in spite of the investment of time and money, problems are creeping back in as exponential growth in derivatives volumes once again outpaces processing capacity. Market participants say the challenge now is to move beyond the relatively easy job of cleaning up practices in the inter-dealer market.“Everybody picked the low hanging fruit last year,” said one industry expert. “You do the inter-dealer trades first. Now you have to go out to all your customers.” Not all buyside investment firms and hedge funds have yet fully embraced the technology available to speed up and automate trade processing as well as important areas such as portfolio valuation.Denise Valentine, senior analyst at consultancy Celent and author of a new study on derivatives processing technology, estimates that, in spite of the progress made since 2005, 30 per cent of OTC derivatives trades still contain errors and require subsequent rebooking.“The buyside is not shifting to the automation paradigm as actively as is needed,” she says, with many OTC trades still confirmed by phone or fax.The Celent report suggests global spending on derivatives processing technology, including both “straight through processing” and valuation, will jump from $188m (€140m, £95m) to $233m a year in the next four years.Even for the dealers, the continuing rapid growth in trading volumes is stretching resources.John Tiner, chief executive of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, recently noted that dealers’ operational staff were often fully occupied with “business as usual” and did not have spare capacity.That, he said, contributed to February’s partial erosion of earlier progress in reducing equity derivatives backlogs.The number of outstanding confirmations also rose in the credit derivatives market in the first two months of this year, according to data posted on the website of Markit, the derivatives data group.But Leo Schlinkert, head of trade processing and distribution at Markit, sees efforts to automate more fully trading across derivatives markets as reaching critical mass. He says buyside and sellside players alike recognise that derivatives trading needs to be automated, both to sustain market growth and to keep track of trades.“With stocks or bonds, all I need to know is, do I have the cash or a security – there is little paperwork to keep track of,” he says. “For a derivative, I have to know the specifics of a trade – and I have to make sure my counterparty knows.”Tom Benison, a managing director at JPMorgan, says operational problems with credit derivatives lent themselves to large-scale solutions early on because a high proportion of total trades were between dealers. Then, he says, “We worked with our clients and said: ‘To maintain the liquidity and growth of the market, we need to fix the operational issues, so we need you to sign up to confirm trades via DTCC’.”The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation set up an electronic confirmation system so that trades could be legally completed electronically rather than festering in paper form.But while dealers had systems to bridge the gap between trading desks and the DTCC’s system, buyside firms often did not. Firms such as Markit, which offers electronic trade processing systems for a range of derivatives, and T-Zero, a credit derivatives specialist, are helping to bridge the gap – along with other groups such as SwapsWire and the prime brokerage arms of big dealer banks.Mark Beeston, president of T-Zero, says he is rapidly adding clients to his platform, which allows the terms of trades to be agreed electronically when a trade is struck and before errors are compounded.“The market still needs to do a lot more in terms of removing errors at source, not after they’ve developed multiple operational symptoms,” he says.Beyond the nitty-gritty of automating trade processing, buyside firms in particular face increasing scrutiny over the valuation of complex and sometimes rarely traded derivatives.One reason is that hedge funds and, to a lesser extent, stock and bond mutual funds are increasingly using interest rate swaps to hedge exposures and credit default swaps for both hedging and investment purposes.These contracts are traded in OTC markets rather than on exchanges and neither funds nor their investors are always willing to accept a single value provided by the dealer who sold them an instrument.“Every single trade needs to be valued based on its characteristics,” says Richard Earl, co-head of Markit’s portfolio valuation division, which collects trading data from dealers and provides valuation services.Many hedge funds and some mutual funds outsource valuation to fund administrators such as Citco, Bank of New York and GlobeOp. They in turn often pull in data from aggregators such as Markit to help value novel and sometimes illiquid instruments. Other valuation data providers include units of rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.The trend towards third-party valuations reflects growing awareness of the challenges of valuation, the development of industry best practices and, in the US, a recognition on the part of accounting authorities that market-based and independent valuations are more reliable and should be formally recognised as such.
1074;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-05-23T21:31:28Z;US derivatives index enjoys bullish debut;;A new US index of derivatives based on high-yield loans saw a very strong launch this week with more than $11bn in notional volumes traded on the first day alone, according to a poll of dealers by information provider Markit Group.This figure is equivalent to more than one-fifth of all single loan derivative contracts outstanding in the US by the start of May this year and compares with about €10bn ($13bn) of total trading volumes on the European index since its launch more than six months ago.Bankers have long talked up the two indices’ potential not only as a hedging tool for commercial lenders and buyers of loans but more importantly, for speculation on the broad outlook for the leveraged loan markets.However, many were surprised at the strength of the first day’s activity. “We were expecting market volume of perhaps $5bn-$6bn, so I was surprised at it reaching $11bn, but I know that’s in line with what we saw,” said Lisa Watkinson, global head of structured credit business development at Lehman Brothers. “It will be a little less frantic on Thursday, but it could be another significant day in terms of volume,” she said on Wednesday.Tom Price at Markit Group, which helped design the index and administrates it, said that $5bn would have been a good start. “As it turned out, we saw more than double that …These volumes illustrate strong investor demand for a synthetic tool to express two-way views on the loan market,” he said.Credit-focused and macro hedge funds were the most active traders, but Ms Watkinson said she was impressed with the breadth and depth of other investor types involved.The tone of the trading was bullish with slightly more demand for buying loan risk. This sent the price of the index above par, which is equivalent to a bond or loan trading for more than its face value.Most trades were conducted in sizes of $25m to $50m, but some trades were as large as $250m, according to participants.●This week saw the first interdealer trade in Europe of a preferred credit default swap, which is a derivative of a hybrid security that comes between equity and debt. Lehman Brothers and BNP Paribas executed the trade through GFI, a London broker.Additional reporting Saskia Scholtes
1075;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-05-13T18:14:23Z;Reuters and competition;;For Tom Glocer, chief executive of Reuters, a proposed deal with Canada’s Thomson is unreservedly good news. If it goes ahead, he will get to run a much bigger group.The deal may be less pleasing for the new group’s clients, particularly the big banks that make up the most profitable segment of Reuters’ customer base. But how much will they really suffer? Reuters and privately held Bloomberg already dominate that end of the market. Bloomberg, which makes more money from fewer terminals, is the higher-priced and, many feel, superior option. Putting Thomson and Reuters together, with significant capacity for cost-cutting, could well provoke stronger competition, at least on price. It could be argued that the merged Thomson-Reuters would still face an uphill struggle in taking on tightly managed Bloomberg. In fixed income, for example, the two had a combined 18 per cent of the market versus Bloomberg’s 38 per cent, according to a 2005 Thomson presentation.Meanwhile, competition to provide the financial data fed through terminals is hotting up. New regulation, in particular Mifid in Europe, will require greater price transparency in trading and boost demand for data. Aggregators such as Markit, which is 60 per cent owned by banks, and stock exchanges, which are trying to sell their own data, are increasingly competing with the three incumbents.Of course, a deal would prompt regulatory scrutiny of every market sector and product. This could mean divestments or other remedies. When Reuters bought smaller rival Moneyline Telerate last year, the Department of Justice made it license software to a competitor.But the fall from three to two terminal providers should not be overly worrying. Both Bloomberg and Thomson-Reuters would have a strong incentive to continue to distribute data from a broadening array of providers – not only to placate regulators but also to improve their products.
1076;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-05-04T17:45:19Z;Reuters marriage would be a tactical union;;For the second time in four days, word of a proposed media deal sent other stocks in the sector flying on Friday. Like Rupert Murdoch’s bid for Dow Jones, Thomson’s approach to Reuters is not yet agreed, but bankers, analysts and investors are already trying to gauge the impact on competitors, and predict who might be next.Reuters and Thomson Financial are in a more discrete market than Dow Jones, although both compete with the news wire owner for the provision of financial news. Mr Murdoch cited evidence that financial information is one thing people are willing to pay for on the internet as one reason for Dow Jones’ appeal.The jump in the shares of Pearson, Reed Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer on Friday reflected hopes of a uniting logic behind the week’s deals.The most immediate and profound implications of a merger with Thomson Financial, however, may be on the smaller players in the market data sector rather than the other diversified media groups.“This is not like Time Warner/AOL where you wonder what they are smoking,” said Lorna Tilbian of Numis Securities. “These deals really make strategic sense.”According to David Anderson, editor of Inside Market Data Reference, financial data providers such as Reuters and Thomson Financial have found the balance of power in their industry has changed.“The customers are merging, as you see with Barclays’ bid for ABN Amro, and the exchanges are merging,” he says.Combining Reuters with Thomson Financial would transform the number two and number three in the industry, and exploit their coincidentally strong strategic and geographic fit to take on Bloomberg, their unquoted rival in the supply of financial data to investment banks, hedge funds and brokerages.There are few reliable statistics on the industry, and the three largest financial data providers operate in sub-sectors that are hard to compare, but according to Inside Market Data Reference such a deal would give Reuters and Thomson Financial a slight lead over Bloomberg’s share of the pure market data sector.On this measure, which accounts for an estimated 90 per cent of Bloomberg’s revenues but two-thirds of its closest rivals’ sales, Bloomberg currently has a third of the market, with Reuters on 23 per cent and Thomson Financial on 11 per cent.Bloomberg has seen the strongest growth of the big three in recent years, growing by an estimated 15 per cent last year compared with Reuters’ 9 per cent growth and Thomson’s 5 per cent increase.But even faster growth has been seen among smaller specialist data groups such as Factset, the unquoted Markit Group and Interactive Data Corporation, which is 62 per cent owned by Pearson’s Financial Times Group.A Reuters deal could provoke mergers between those smaller groups, Mr Anderson argues. If a combined Thomson and Reuters were going up against Bloomberg, he asks, “would these players suddenly have a chance because the 1200lb gorillas of the industry are so focused on fighting each other?”The recent growth from Reuters has bucked a tougher trend in recent years, however, and there are still concerns about the industry’s long-term business model.Traditionally, the business grew and shrank with the number of terminals on traders’ desks. Lay-offs in a market downturn would mean fewer traders and investment bankers, and therefore fewer terminals.With algorithm-crunching computers replacing humans in certain corners of the market, some have predicted the death of the trader.It is a prediction with which Reuters and Thomson Financial disagree, but both have made deliberate efforts to cut their dependence on the more easily commodified elements of their business, and to open up new markets.Tom Glocer, Reuters’ chief executive, branded its efforts to expand in electronic trading, premium content, enterprise-wide deals and new geographic markets Core Plus. Initially dismissed by some analysts as another in a string of “jam tomorrow” restructurings from Reuters, it has begun to show results.At Thomson Financial, chief executive Sharon Rowlands has led a similar transformation, launching Japanese products and chasing private equity markets. The focus has been on providing information that is hard to get elsewhere, and packaging it as clients want.Analysts believe the two companies will fit well together. Reuters’ British origins have given it a stronghold in the City of London and other European financial capitals, while Thomson has more of a bias towards North America.Thomson has traditionally been weaker than Reuters in sales and trading products for institutional equities and fixed income customers, but stronger in investment banking areas such as merger and acquisition data.Mr Glocer, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer by training, will know that past deals in the sector have prompted close scrutiny by competition authorities.With approval also needed by Reuters’ Founders Share Company, a Thomson deal is not a certainty.
1077;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Global Overview: US stocks, bonds rally;;A rally in US stocks on Monday afternoon obscured fresh worries over the survival of a leading US subprime mortgage lender which had weighed on global markets earlier in the day.New Century Financial’s admission that its lenders had cut off credit or planned to do so heightened concern about the broader impact the sector’s difficulties could have on the US housing market and the overall economy.However, the market reaction was modest apart from a rally in US Treasury bonds as investors reduced risk. News of acquisitions – including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ agreed $7.3bn deal to buy Dollar General – combined with improved sentiment to boost US equities in the afternoon, although housebuilders suffered.Meanwhile, credit investors shrugged off New Century’s woes, which appeared priced into the market. Indices of credit default swaps – a type of insurance against default – were mixed in light trading but remained at lower levels than during the sharp sell-off that began last month, indicating lower perceived credit risk. Bonds of financial groups were also little changed. But traders were ”nervous” and focussed on subprime developments, said Kevin Gould, executive vice president at Markit, the data group.A bigger impact was seen in government bonds with yields in the US falling as investors shifted cash to the safety of US Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3.6 basis points to 4.556 per cent. The two-year note yield was 4.2bp lower at 4.636 per cent.The Vix index, a measure of investor expectations of US stock market volatility, rose nearly 5 per cent before falling back to 13.99, just below Friday’s level.Steven Wieting, economist at Citigroup, said rising mortgage delinquencies were more significant for financial institutions and investors than for the economy.“In all likelihood, credit problems for low-net-worth consumers are not a substantial issue for the overall pace of consumption,” he said. “The modest share of the population and the low share of national income associated with adjustable rate subprime loans also suggests little consumer demand impact.”However, Jorma Korhonen, the manager of the £2.8bn Fidelity Global Special Situations Fund, said the difficulties with US subprime mortgages contained all the ingredients of a possible credit crunch.“If this were so, it could trigger a reduction in global liquidity. Obviously, this would have negative implications for other asset classes, including equities,” he told a Q&A on FT.com.The Mortgage Lender Implode-o-Meter website said the number of sector lenders that had “croaked” since late last year had gone up to 36.Meanwhile, the yen rose against the dollar on worries over the US economy and news that Japan’s fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised from an annualised 4.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent, well above expectations. The dollar fell 0.6 per cent to Y117.66 against the yen.Speculators also slashed positions betting on a fall in the yen in the week to March 6, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They also cut net long positions in sterling and the Australian dollar.In commodity markets, West Texas Intermediate dropped through the $60-a-barrel mark amid forecasts of warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere and ahead of a meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday. WTI fell $1.14 to $58.91 a barrel.
1078;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
1079;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-01-22T23:43:22Z;Banks launch Boat to rival exchanges;;A user-owned electronic billboard for share transactions said yesterday it had appointed software partners, underscoring the seriousness with which some of the world’s biggest investment banks are pursuing their goal of building low-cost competitors to Europe’s stock exchanges.Project Boat is one of two initiatives announced by investment banks who say they are being overcharged on tariffs by exchanges that make profit margins of 50 per cent and more. In addition to Boat, the banks have unveiled Project Turquoise, a low-cost alternative trading platform.The banks involved in Boat dominate share trading in Europe. ABN Amro, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS have signed up. Many of these are also behind Turquoise, giving both projects credibility that previous competitive efforts have not had.Competition in share trading is fierce already in the US where many of the bank participants are based.Boat is a trade reporting service. Banks are required to publish every trade they execute, with many exchanges requiring it to be done on the exchange the bargain was conducted. For this, the exchange collects a fee and repackages the collected data for sale to third parties.“They charge us to enter the casino and they charge us to leave it,” complained an executive at one bank involved in BoatHowever, when a new European directive, Mifid, takes effect in November, trades can be published anywhere, allowing competition to take place.Last week, the London Stock Exchange announced it would slash its trade reporting fees by 80 per cent, with effect from next November, which is also Boat’s target start date.Markit Group, the leading independent data gatherer, and Cinnober Financial Technology were unveiled as partners in the platform.“Boat will allow financial institutions to address Mifid’s trade reporting requirements in an increasingly regulated and competitive business environment,” said Duncan Paterson of Cygnet Consulting, on behalf of all consortium members.He added that the platform had been designed with the possibility in mind that trading in other instruments such as bonds could also be subject to the same rules once a decision is taken later this year.
1080;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-01-20T00:05:21Z;Ecuador downgraded amid talk of restructuring;;Standard & Poor’s downgraded Ecuador’s credit rating a notch to CCC on Friday, citing “repeated policy signals” suggestive of an attempt to restructure its debt.The move follows talk that the government might decide not to pay interest due on February 15 and a Citigroup report that a senior official had told investors he felt much of the country’s foreign debt was “illegitimate”.“Recently inaugurated President Rafael Correa and his economic team continue to call for a restructuring of Ecuador’s debt and the subordination of timely debt service to other political priorities,” said Lisa Schineller, a credit analyst at S&P.She added that Ecuador had “one of the weakest payment cultures” among the countries rated by S&P but noted that policy implementation could differ from “electoral rhetoric” now that Mr Correa was in office. Nonetheless, S&P placed a negative outlook on the new rating.The government has 30 days’ grace in which to make next month’s interest payment but S&P said the rating could be cut further if the government suggested it would not pay or proposed a restructuring. Mr Correa’s rhetoric has fuelled volatile trading since late last year.“The continued lack of clarity on the external debt front has kept Ecuadorian bond prices on a rollercoaster,” said analysts at Bear Stearns.Growing investor concern has seen the cost of insuring against default by Ecuador more than quadruple in two months. According to data from Markit, the annual cost of credit default swap protection has risen from less than 3 percentage points in mid-November to more than 12 percentage points. Ecuador’s bonds are now seen as markedly riskier than those of Iraq, for which the corresponding cost of credit protection is about 5 percentage points.Citigroup said on Thursday that Ricardo Patino, the economy minister, had told a group of investors he would make social spending a priority over debt payments. Mr Patino reportedly went on to talk about a debt restructuring involving forgiveness of 60 per cent of its external debt. Mr Correa has said he would take advice on any restructuring from Argentina, which two years ago pushed through a restructuring that cost creditors about two-thirds of their original investment.Mr Patino also said on Ecuadorian television that the administration had held talks on borrowing up to $1bn from the fellow leftist government of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Reuters reported. In the current environment, any offer to investors involving a “haircut” would constitute a default by Ecuador, S&P said. The country’s external foreign debt load is about $10bn.The rating agency added that in spite of apparent government arrears, there seem to be sufficient funds to service debt, suggesting that any default would be a result of unwillingness rather than inability to pay.
1081;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2007-01-15T22:53:27Z;New derivative index planned;;Markit Group and eight banks plan to launch a European index of derivatives based on the most liquid bonds backed by commercial mortgages.They hope to launch the index by the end of this quarter. However, there are obstacles and some of those involved believe that talk of a first-quarter launch might be premature.The market for European commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) has accelerated in the past two years, with new issuance growing about 60 per cent to €65bn in 2006, according to Barclays Capital.Trading of related credit default swaps (CDSs), which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of interest or principal on the debt, is still in its formative stages but it is hoped that the launch of an index will help boost secondary-market liquidity for both the derivatives and the bonds themselves.In the US, the CMBS market is much larger and more established. An index of related credit default swaps, known as CMBX was launched in January 2006.The main challenge in Europ will be to move the market to standardised documentation.Markit and the banks involved – Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS – propose two euro indices for bonds rated AAA and BBB and two sterling indices for the same ratings. Each index will reference 20 CDSs of CMBS.“The dealers and buy-side community are both very supportive of a European index,” said Nathan Kirk, at Markit. “A launch at the end of the first quarter is targeted but the index needs standardised documents in place before then.”In Europe, CDSs of CMBS use a total-return swap format, where the two parties involved settle the contract at the end of its life, or when a bond defaults, with a single payment based on the total of losses, write-downs and missed interest payments. In the US, the market has a standardised pay-as-you-go contract, which sees a series of payments back and forth between the counterparties of the swap. This could be related to write-downs in the value of the underlying securities, or missed interest payments or losses if the bond defaults.Ron Miao, director in asset backed securities trading at Citigroup, said: “This project has gone through various different development stages over the past two to three years, but we have moved much closer to a viable end product and broad agreement among participants.“While a decision has not been finalised, fundamentally we believe a common standard will enhance acceptance of a European index.”
1082;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-11-29T18:47:52Z;Markit launches trade finance pricing;;Growing interest among investors in buying and selling the deferred payments from cross-border trade has prompted Markit Group, the third-party data provider, to launch a trade finance pricing and index service.Trade finance is the debt generated against import or export orders that can help bridge the gap between the costs of producing goods or services and the payment for them when they are received.It has traditionally been provided by banks that would hold the debt until maturity. However, a greater focus among banks on the amount of capital they have to hold against the loans they make, particularly due to the incoming Basel II rules, means they are looking for other investors to take the risk off their hands.James Parsons, managing director of LTP Trade, which sold the basis of the pricing service to Markit, said the impact of the Basel II rules, which are designed to match better the capital banks hold with the risks that they take, was a main driver of the market.“Trade finance has traditionally been a buy-and-hold business for commercial banks,” he said. “What has changed is the capital considerations of it under Basel II.”Investment managers, particularly hedge funds, are also more interested in trade finance as an asset class and in getting involved in the secondary market that exists between banks and trades a few hundred billion dollars worth of debt annually.The Markit service will focus mainly on debts into emerging market countries, which, because of their higher risk, attract more punitive capital charges under Basel II.“The EM coverage we have is going to grow,” said Mark Hunt, director of product development at Markit.“There are a number of market forces that gives us confidence, along with growing investor interest.”
1083;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Structured credit squeezes bearish trades;;The rally in European and US credit derivatives markets may have its base in a better outlook for corporate debt but it is the sudden hype generated by one new kind of structured product that has really caught traders off guard and put the squeeze on bearish positions.This product, which allows investors to make a highly leveraged bet on the credit derivative indices, did not exist until this year, and only came to light in August following the first large public deal from ABN Amro.Since then, ratings agencies say that almost every investment bank has been working on or selling these deals, known as constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs).Up to $1bn worth of deals have been issued since early September and several times that are due to hit the market this year, according to bankers, but the key to their impact is in the leverage they employ.According to Paul Mazataud, a managing director at Moody’s, such deals typically begin with leverage levels of 10-15 times, which means $1bn worth of deals would add up to $15bn worth of unexpected protection selling in the same time frame, putting pressure on spread levels.The effects of this can be seen in the main iTraxx Europe index of investment grade credit default swaps, which provides protection against default for a basket of companies.The spread, or protection premium, for a five-year contract on this index has collapsed in the past month from just above 30 basis points to about 22bp, according to figures from Markit Group. However, Andrew Whittle, a managing director in structured products at Barclays Capital, says the arrival of CPDOs in the market is as important as the amounts they trade.“The significance of CPDOs is more than simply the amount of protection sold, which is probably not enough in itself to cause the tightening we’ve seen in the past couple of months,” he said.The arrival of these products had materially changed the factors at play in the indices, which meant that those who were taking a bearish view of credit through short positions had to adjust their trades, he said.Lisa Watkinson, head of structured credit business development at Lehman Brothers, also thinks the actual trading impact of these deals has not been huge.“The market on average is seeing $30bn-$50bn in index trading a day across the iTraxx and CDX, so its probably the hype around these deals or the fear of a wave of protection selling that is moving the market,” she said.The CPDOs sold so far work by taking a a series of very large bets on CDS indices in order to quickly generate enough income to pay a coupon of about Libor plus 200bp annually over 10 years.Investors are exposed to the risks not just of companies represented in the indices defaulting, but also of sudden increases in the premium that the indices pay.And because the structure will increase leverage if there are losses in a deal, in order to generate higher incomes and try to recover those losses, they can behave like a gambler chasing bad bets.
1084;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-10-25T20:32:57Z;Cost of insuring Cablecom doubles;;The cost of insuring Cablecom against default more than doubled on Wednesday on news that the Swiss cable TV group was planning to issue a new 10-year €300m bond.The group’s credit default swaps, which act as a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt, had been trading at low levels compared with similarly rated peers because of concerns that it would soon have no outstanding debt.The cost of insuring €10m of Cablecom bonds over five years jumped by €235,000 per year to €435,000 at its highest on Wednesday, but later settled back at about €405,000 – or a 405bp spread.The company had been buying back its outstanding bonds bit by bit, and its remaining €290m in debt was expected to be refinanced by its parent company, UPC, according to traders.If a company defaults, the seller of protection in a CDS contract pays out the face value of the debt covered to the buyer, who in turn hands over the company’s bonds. When there are no bonds outstanding, a CDS contract can become worthless to the buyer.Cablecom’s new bond, which is being sold by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, will be used to refinance its outstanding bonds, but the new issue is callable after three years, a banker familiar with the sale said.The jump in the CDS price means Cablecom is now trading more in line with other CCC rated groups.Corus CDS have also seen a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks, first plummeting on the news that India’s Tata Steel was bidding for the UK steel group, then jumping again at the start of this week on news of how Tata might finance a successful bid.Market players had assumed that the Indian group would bear the cost of buying Corus itself and that the relationship with a new parent would strengthen the UK group’s credit outlook.The CDS price dropped 20bp to about 159bp on October 5 when news of the bid emerged, according to data from Markit group. It continued to trend downwards, hitting a low of 135bp last Friday, according to Markit, though Suki Mann, credit strategist at SG CIB, said it hit an intra-day low of 109.5bp that day.However, once it emerged that Tata could finance a bid more like a leveraged buy-out, keeping the debt attached to the UK group, the price shot up once more, leaving it at about 155bp yesterday.
1085;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-09-13T20:09:15Z;Loan CDS index set for launch;;The first indices to track the performance of derivatives based on tradeable high- yield loans are set to be launched in Europe and the US in a matter of weeks, marking another step forward in the fast-growing credit derivatives markets.The European index, known as LevX, is expected to come first – although its launch date is drifting later than an original target of next Wednesday – in spite of the fact a number of large dealer banks will not support it.Both indices will track movements in loan credit default swaps, or LCDSs, which offer a kind of insurance against non-payment of high-yield secured loans.“We will be launching an LCDS index, under the brand LevX, soon in Europe,” said Robert Lepone, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, which is spearheading the development of a European index.Other banks to support LevX include Dresdner Kleinwort, Lehman Brothers, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.However, development of LCDSs in Europe has suffered some controversy, leaving banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup uninterested in co-operating in the new index and Goldman Sachs reviewing its stance.The dispute has been over the form of LCDS contracts, with those pushed by Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort differing in one important aspect from the standard that has developed in the US.In Europe, once a particular loan to a company has been refinanced, the LCDS contract is then cancelled, with new contracts drawn up for new loans. In the US, the contract can remain open if there is a new loan that participants agree can be referenced by the LCDS.The European contract is expected to become similar to the US one in the early months of an index, in part because of the way trading in the underlying loans is developing in Europe.“What is the point of trading an index when the documentation will change after series one or two? It is just confusing for investors,” said one trader at a large dealer bank.Meanwhile, the US index, known as LCDX, is set to be launched this autumn with the support of all dealer banks. Markit Group, a data supplier, will calculate both indices on behalf of the companies that run them – International Index Company in Europe and CDSIndex Co in the US.Tom Price, director of loans and LCDSs at Markit, feels that the index will gravitate toward a US-style document.“As the market importance of institutional investors grows, the need for a cancellable contract diminishes,” he said.
1086;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit acquires its ‘final weapon’;;Markit Group on Monday said it had added the final piece of the jigsaw in its attempt to become the leading data provider for markets in derivatives markets with a deal to buy MarketXS – its largest acquisition so far.The company said the deal would enable it to distribute its market data and valuations services more widely and to almost any location.Markit, which is owned by a group of investment banks along with some private investors and staff, has grown through a series of acquisitions and organically from being a provider of daily pricing on credit derivatives to covering all manner of other over-the-counter instruments.This expansion comes as a clutch of small, private-sector companies are competing to provide different aspects of the infrastructure needed to create a global derivatives market.“We have now acquired all the various weapons we need in our arsenal to compete,” said Markit chief executive, Lance Uggla. “Markit has strong content and our clients expect us to be able to deliver in a variety of fashions. Not just just on the web, but real time in any format.”The deal for MarketXS, a Dutch provider of software and technology for data distribution and trading, was not just about acquiring technology that the firm could have rented, but about getting the people who can develop new systems as needed, he said.Mr Uggla said that the mostly cash deal was the largest financially and in terms of the number of staff taken on in the company’s history, although no details were given.
1087;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-08-02T20:36:00Z;Markit to launch payments database;;"The market for credit derivatives based on asset-backed debt is set for a boost later this summer with the launch of standardised payment calculations from data provider Markit Group.The move reflects the importance of standardising practices if innovative financial products are to turn into meaningful markets.A credit default swap is a type of insurance against default on the underlying security. CDS instruments based on asset-backed securities, or ABCDS, represent a development of the much larger and still rapidly-growing market for CDS based on corporate credit.The ABCDS market started in earnest after the release of standardised contract documentation in June 2005. The launch of two index products tracking portfolios of ABS deals – a development that has broadened the market’s appeal – has prompted tremendous growth in trading volumes.Dealers estimate that the total exposure underlying outstanding contracts in the single name and index markets now stands at about $175bn, with an estimated $5bn worth of contracts trading each week.Further growth in the single-name ABCDS market has been hampered by settlement, the last remaining piece of the standardisation puzzle.Unlike credit default swaps on unsecured debt, which are subject to one-time settlement in response to trigger events, ABCDS have a pay-as-you-go structure in which payment shortfalls are calculated on a monthly basis.Ben Logan, director of product development at Markit Group, says the system has created two hurdles for participants: the timeliness and availability of data for the required calculations is poor; and calculating the payments is complex, with participants interpreting elements of the contract documentation in a variety of ways.“Settlement is all about arriving at the same answers as your counterparty, but when there is all this room for differentiation, mismatches are common, making it very difficult for the market to scale properly,” said Mr Logan.Markit’s solution is the Reference Cashflow Database (RCD).Under development since the beginning of the year and operational for the ABCDS indices, the database holds information on almost 15,000 ABS securities. Markit began testing its data and calculations for single-name contracts this week with a group of four dealers.Although many of the banks have their own internal databases, Todd Kushman, managing director and product specialist for ABCDS at Bear Stearns in New York, says the RCD will encourage greater investor participation."
1088;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-07-02T21:00:25Z;FSA monitors credit markets pricing;;"The Financial Services Authority, the UK financial watchdog, has for the first time started to monitor daily price movements in London’s credit default swaps and loan trading markets.The move is intended to help the regulator determine whether some banks and other investors are engaged in insider trading in these fast-growing markets, which take place away from exchanges and tend to be opaque.The initiative comes amid sweeping changes in the loan market as hedge funds and other institutions have joined banks in underwriting corporate loans. Some bankers fear that hedge funds may be getting access to privileged information via these loan purchases, and then using that data to trade other instruments, such as CDSs or shares.
The FSA has a good capability to track and screen for unusual movements of shares and other instruments that are traded on exchanges. However, since CDS and loan trading takes place off-exchange, it has not had timely data showing price movements.However, the regulator decided recently to buy pricing data on these sectors from Markit, a private sector group. “Given the increasing importance of the credit markets, the FSA has stepped up its surveillance of market conduct in this sector,” a senior official said. “As part of this, we have recently acquired access to the Markit pricing system to provide us with an effective monitoring tool.”The move by the FSA follows a six-month review of the credit markets, partly prompted by growing complaints about the dangers of insider trading.One area of concern is the leveraged loan market. As recently as five years ago, this market was dominated by banks in Europe. However, credit funds – including both traditional hedge funds and portfolio investors – now account for almost half of all primary leveraged loan deals.These purchases potentially give hedge funds access to privileged information that used to be the sole preserve of the banks.This shift has prompted the Association of Corporate Treasurers to press the Loan Market Association to call for loan documents to include more stringent confidentiality clauses. “[Corporate] borrowers need to be very vigilant now – they need to think about confidentiality clauses and make sure they have appropriate documentation,” said Martin O’Donovan at the ACT."
1089;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-06-16T18:55:06Z;Market Overview: Wild ride for commodities and equities;;There was no shortage of drama in financial markets as equity and commodity prices saw wild swings in a busy week for US economic data releases.Emerging market stocks suffered the worst of the week’s volatility. Indian stocks, for example, plunged some 9 per cent over the first three days of the week, only to rally more than 10 per cent in the final two trading sessions.Wall Street also had a rollercoaster ride. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was briefly in negative territory for the year before rallying. In afternoon trading on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent for the week, the Nasdaq Composite off 0.2 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1.1 per cent.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent over the five days.But Tokyo staged a strong recovery. The Nikkei 225 Average plunged 4.1 per cent on Tuesday, its worst one-day drop for two years, but for the week as a whole ended 0.9 per cent higher.It was the Nikkei’s first weekly increase in six weeks.In commodities, gold tumbled below $600 an ounce on Tuesday as it suffered its biggest one-day drop in 15 years. It subsequently recovered some of its poise but was still down more than 5 per cent over the week in late European trade on Friday.Copper also had a volatile week, falling as low as $6,440 a tonne on Wednesday before bouncing back through $7,000.Oil prices lost ground over the week, with US crude futures touching a two-month low despite the onset of the Atlantic hurricane season.Persistent worries about inflation kept global markets under pressure at the start of the week, although investors appeared to shake off some of their concerns despite a higher than expected reading for the core US consumer price index in May. The futures market immediately moved to fully price in another quarter-point rise in US interest rates this month and significantly raised the chance of a further tightening in August.However, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did his bit to help the stock market by playing down the threat of higher energy prices to inflation and growth.But strategists continued to warn that there was a real fear in the markets that the Fed’s desire to show it was on top of inflation might result in a slowdown in US growth. Ian Harwood, research analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, noted that while the bond market’s break-even inflation rate – the gap between the US 10-year bond yield and the index-linked yield – had eased back, growth-sensitive asset classes, notably equities and commodities, had suffered very substantial setbacks.“Clearly, investors are worrying increasingly about Fed overkill,” Mr Harwood said, as he suggested that whenever the Fed had tightened in the past, it had tended to over-do it.Mr Harwood pointed to the recent inversion of the yield curve – where short-dated bonds yield more than long-dated paper – as an important early warning sign that the US economy might suffer a “hard landing”. “The yield curve should be closely watched – especially as so many sought to play down the significance of its inversion in the first half of 2000, only to see US demand and activity seriously falter in the second half exactly as the yield curve had suggested,” he said.Tony Dolphin, director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors, said that investors had recently reappraised the global economic picture and noticed that the outlook had deteriorated.He said that equity markets were likely to remain volatile over the next few months and were unlikely to resume a sustained upward trajectory.But he added: “Valuation is reasonable and, unless the economic environment takes a serious turn for the worse, this does not appear to be the start of a major bear market.“Rather it is pay-back for the well-above-trend returns of the last three years.”

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York this year joined regulators, such as the Financial Services Authority in the UK, to urge leading dealers to clean up settlement difficulties in the credit derivatives market.Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, and Leo Schlinkert, chief executive of Communicator, said the combination of the groups would give dealers and asset managers in the markets enhanced trading and risk management capabilities.“The challenges that lie ahead in the shape of rising transaction volumes in the OTC derivatives markets will continue to test the industry’s operational processes and attract regulatory concern,” said Mr Schlinkert, who is due to join Markit’s executive team.“The combination of Markit’s pricing and valuation services with Communicator’s OTC derivatives post-trade platform meets these challenges by offering an end-to-end service including trade confirmation, pricing [and] valuation.”He said it would also serve “trade life cycle events” such as when open contracts were sold between parties, which has previously caused further documentation and settlement headaches in the markets.Mr Uggla added: “We are bringing together complementary services, which reduce risk and improve efficiency.”The companies already serve a number of the same dealer banks on both sides of the Atlantic, but there was less of an overlap among investment, or “buy-side”, clients, the companies said.Markit, part-owned by a group of 13 banks, has a base of hedge fund clients, who trade actively in derivatives, while Communicator has a roster of more traditional asset management clients.
1091;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markit to provide prices to iTraxx;;International Index Company, which runs the iTraxx indices of credit default swaps, said on Thursday it had signed up Markit Group, an independent data provider, to give daily pricing on its indices.It is the latest sign of the financial industry’s attempts to improve the robustness and reliability of pricing in the market for CDS – a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt – as a broader range of investors gains exposure to this fast growing sector.In particular, increasing numbers of investors beyond sophisticated investment banks, including even retail investors, are buying products with exposure to credit derivatives. This is prompting issuers, investors and brokers to provide more reliable and regular pricing on illiquid and over-the-counter products, including those that have come under intense regulatory scrutiny in recent months.David Mark, IIC’s chief executive, said the company had chosen Markit because it had the infrastructure and data feeds from more than 60 traders and market makers already in place.“What we were providing ourselves was adequate, but we wanted to put it on a better footing…to make sure we had the most reliable and robust data,” Mr Mark said.“Once you have products that go even potentially to retail investors and that are structured on a number of indices that might include iTraxx, then it is very important that you have the most reliable prices.”Kevin Gould, head of data products and analytics at Markit, said the company had long-standing relationships with traders and had the ability to clean up prices and strip out erroneous data.
1092;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
1093;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-04-10T18:29:26Z;Markit marks derivatives to market;;Markit Group, a pricing and data provider, will on Tuesday launch its portfolio valuation service for hedge funds, asset managers and administrators overseeing investments in over the counter derivatives.The service adds to a trend among data providers and ratings agency arms to provide regular post-trade valuations for illiquid financial products in the face of concerns about transparency.The spotlight has been on credit derivatives, including credit default swaps – a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt. There was a doubling in market size last year to about $17,500bn in notional outstanding value.Markit said it would offer valuations on a wide range of derivatives from CDSs and synthetic collateralised debt obligations – investments created from pools of CDSs – to equity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives.Will Meldrum, a director at Markit, said the company would also conduct valuations of asset-backed securities issues in the second phase of the service’s development.With many OTC derivatives, particularly bespoke deals, regular mark to market pricing is problematic because there is little secondary trading and so the original selling bank is often the only source of guidance.Markit began providing the service to 20 select clients at the end of last year. Gennaro Pucci, a structured credit hedge fund manager at Credaris, said his investors demanded accurate, third-party valuations.“Without this kind of service, we are reliant on banks’ counterparties for valuations,” he said.
1094;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-02-16T18:00:56Z;Delphi casts pall over GM recovery;;Stock and bond markets have been showing increasing scepticism about the prospects for General Motors amid concerns that Delphi, its bankrupt former subsidiary, may be unable to reach a negotiated deal with its unions.While the company’s stock remains above the lows of late 2005, short interest – a measure of investors betting that the share price will fall – reached an all-time high of 17 per cent of the shares outstanding in January.“Investors have grown increasingly sceptical about GM’s turnround plans, likely owing to the cash-light nature of the expected 2006 financial improvements,” said Christopher Ceraso, equity analyst at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile, the annual cost of insuring against a GM bankruptcy using credit default swaps rose steadily from 994 basis points at the beginning of February to 1265bp on Tuesday, although it fell back to 1226bp the next day, according to data from Markit.“The people willing to sell protection are backing off,” said Kirk Ludtke, credit analyst at JPMorgan.He said investors were worried, among other things, about a confrontation between Delphi and its unions. The parts supplier could ask the bankruptcy court as early as Friday to throw out its existing labour contracts, risking a damaging strike.“Without a negotiated solution, it’s a much more dangerous path,” said Mr Ludtke.GM’s operations could suffer from any stoppages at its biggest supplier. GM could also be liable for some of Delphi’s healthcare, pension and severance liabilities because of guarantees given when it spun the parts supplier off in 1999.
1095;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2006-01-17T18:01:01Z;Calpine auction eases derivative settlement;;Credit derivative index transactions referring to Calpine, the US power generator that filed for bankruptcy last month, can now be settled with cash rather than by handing over bonds after an auction to set a reference price for the bonds was completed on Tuesday.Setting a cash price for a bankrupt company’s bonds simplifies the credit derivative settlement process and helps avoid a bond shortage, which can arise if the volume of outstanding derivatives exceeds the bonds available in the market.The price set for Calpine bonds was 19.125 cents on the dollar. The auction process – managed by Markit Group, a valuation specialist, and Creditex, an electronic credit derivative trading business – has been developed through four bankruptcies last year, most recently that of Delphi, the car parts maker.A version of the process – which is currently orchestrated on a case-by-case basis by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association – is expected to become the standard for some types of credit derivative contracts.Credit derivatives include single-name credit default swaps – a form of insurance against a company’s default – and related index products. The fast-growing market topped $12,000bn in notional outstanding contracts last June, according to ISDA.In another industry development, a new credit derivative index tracking a basket of securities backed by US home equity loans, was launched on Tuesday.The index, known as ABX, reflects the broadening of the market, and complements the young but rapidly growing market in credit default swaps based on single asset-backed securities.The index will be administered by CDS IndexCo, the dealer-owned company that manages the CDX corporate credit derivative indices, and Markit.Separately, Creditex said it had appointed John Grifonetti as president and chief operating officer at a time of “strong growth and expansion” for the company. Mr Grifonetti comes from an electronic trading background. Creditex says it has electronically executed credit derivative trades worth more than $500bn in notional exposure.
1096;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ABX will aid swaps;;A new credit derivative index tracking a basket of securities backed by US home equity loans will be launched next week, according to its developers.The appearance of the new index, known as ABX, reflects the continued broadening of the credit derivative market, which more than doubled in the year to last June to top an estimated $12,000bn in notional outstanding contracts.The ABX will complement the young market in credit default swaps based on single asset-backed securities, sometimes known as ABCDSs – a type of insurance against default on the underlying ABS.Trading in ABCDSs took off last June, when the International Swaps and Derivatives Association published standard documentation for the contracts.The instruments are used to help hedge exposure to the US property market. The launch of the ABX, however, could broaden the appeal of the market.“The index should act as a catalyst to bring in other people who wouldn’t otherwise have entered the market,” said Kevin Gould, executive vice-president at Markit Group, an asset valuation and data specialist.Fifteen commercial and investment banks have so far signed up to trade the ABX. The index will be administered by CDS IndexCo, the dealer-owned company that manages the CDX corporate credit derivative indices, and Markit.
1097;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bond market puts heat on GMAC sale;;Bond markets are showing signs of impatience with Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors.The market welcomed his announcement last month that the company would sell a controlling stake in General Motors Acceptance Corporation, its profitable finance arm. GMAC’s bonds shot up to levels that implied it might get its investment grade credit rating back.But in recent days, after trading almost independently of GM’s credit for a time, GMAC’s bonds have tracked lower. The cost of credit default swaps, a form of insurance against default, have tracked higher – in parallel with GM’s – before sharing in a modest recovery at the end of last week.“Every day you don’t hear something, the markets get more and more itchy,” said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights. “A lot of market observers, especially rating agencies, have been giving GM . . . a lot of leash to try to concoct a deal to separate GMAC and [residential mortgage unit] ResCap from the woes of GM.”The annual cost of five-year credit default swaps for GMAC exceeded 5 percentage points in early October, meaning it would have cost more than $500,000 a year to protect against default on $10m of the finance unit’s debt. That fell almost as low as $200,000 a year in the days after GM said it would sell a stake in GMAC, the lowest level since January. But it has since climbed again, more than doubling to $412,000 on Friday, according to data from Markit. GMAC continues to be seen as a better credit than GM itself.GM has plenty of cash, and a quick sale may not be crucial to its immediate survival. But if Mr Wagoner can pull one off, it would bolster his credibility. And if no positive news emerges soon, the low investment-grade credit rating of ResCap could be at risk.Standard & Poor’s reminded the market last week that a return to investment grade for GMAC and the preservation of ResCap’s rating – critical to maintaining a cost of funds that allows it to be competitive in the mortgage business – depend on the sale of a stake in GMAC.GM is still exploring the sale of a stake in GMAC but any deal could take time, a company spokeswoman said.Mr Hendler suggested several possible hurdles to an agreement, mot least that the number of buyers for such a large business is limited. Analysts estimate GMAC’s total value at more than $20bn.Price could also be a sticking point, with GMAC’s key businesses – mortgages and car loans – both leaving periods of near-ideal market conditions behind. “The right time to sell was in 2003,” said Mr Hendler.
1098;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2005-08-25T18:28:34Z;Rising oil stretching Indonesia finances;;The cost of insuring against Indonesia defaulting on its debt has risen sharply this week as investors fear that surging oil prices are stretching the government’s finances.On Thursday, the rupiah, Indonesia’s currency, hit a three and a half year low against the dollar as record oil prices, which have touched $68 a barrel, raise import costs. The prospect of rising inflation and the need for higher interest rates to stem the currency weakness have contributed to continued selling in bonds.“A confluence of factors has come to a head and this is now playing out in the financial markets,” said Joyce Chang, head of emerging markets research at JPMorgan. Every dollar rise in oil translates to about a $300m decrease in foreign exchange reserves, she said. Since the start of the month, there has been about a 10 per cent decline in reserves.Underscoring the concern in the market, spreads on five-year credit default swaps have widened to 308 basis points from about 255bp at the beginning of the week. That means the cost of insuring about $10m of debt against a default has risen about 21 per cent to $308,000.“The sovereign is in the unlikely position of being a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries but also a net importer of oil, and the slide in the rupiah will make the price of oil relatively more expensive,” said Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit Group. “To make matters worse, Indonesia provides fuel subsidies for the nation’s poor, and is therefore feeling the cost of the price rises more acutely.”The government on Thursday said it would take appropriate actions, including raising domestic fuel prices.
1099;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2005-08-11T20:58:07Z;MarketAxess raises stakes in CDS trading;;MarketAxess, the operator of an electronic bond trading platform, plans to launch trading of credit default swap indices in September, the company said on Thursday.It is in a race with TradeWeb, its main rival in the dealer-to-client market, to be the first to offer trading in credit derivatives as well as cash bonds. TradeWeb plans to launch its new service at around the same time.The market for credit derivatives – and, in particular, index products such as the iTraxx and Dow Jones CDX indices – is relatively new and has been growing far more rapidly than the more mature market for so-called “cash” bonds, thanks in part to the increasing use of derivative products by hedge funds.“We need to be in that space,” said Barry Goldenberg, credit derivatives product manager at MarketAxess. “It is critical for our penetration of leveraged accounts, and hedge funds in particular. They trade a lot more CDS than bonds.”As part of its move, MarketAxess said on Thursdsay it had signed up for an industry standard system that helps reduce processing errors by accurately identifying the reference entities underlying credit derivative trades.Delays and errors in handling trades have caught the eye of financial regulators in recent months, boosting efforts in the industry to provide fully automated systems for confirming, matching and settling trades – a goal referred to as “straight through processing”.MarketAxess has subscribed to a referencing system – known as Red – provided by Markit Group, a specialist in valuing complex financial instruments.The company also said it would feed information to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the industry-owned organisation that has a near-monopoly of settlement services for shares and bonds traded in the US and is increasingly involved in processing derivatives trades.“The implementation of the MarketAxess electronic trading platform for the credit indices is made that much easier by the use of Red,” said Peter Axilrod, managing director of new business development at DTCC.“Matching on Red identifiers for all credit derivatives greatly enhances the value of our service.”DTCC collects information from both parties in a trade, and attempts to match it. At least until recently, around 60 per cent of incorrect matches resulted from the two parties’ entry of different reference entities or obligations, according to Mr Axilrod – sometimes simply because of spelling errors or incorrect company names.The Red system aims to eliminate such problems by giving a unique identifying code to each legal entity and each specific obligation that is used as the basis for a derivative product.The system has recently become widely used among big credit derivatives dealers, but it has been “a little more difficult” to persuade their customers to adopt it, according to Mr Goldenberg at MarketAxess.He said more customers could begin using Red identifiers once credit derivatives can be traded on the MarketAxess platform. “We already have all the buyside people using our system [to trade cash bonds],” he said.Following the launch of CDS index trading, the next step for MarketAxess is to add single-name CDS trading to its platform – something the company plans for some time in 2006, according to Mr Goldenberg.
1100;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2005-06-14T18:10:52Z;CDS cash auction works ‘perfectly’;;The first use of a procedure to ease the settlement of some credit derivative transactions passed off “perfectly” on Tuesday, according to organisers.Dealers participated in an auction to fix a price for cash settlement of US credit default swap index trades involving Collins & Aikman, the bankrupt car parts supplier.The move to cash settlement over physical delivery of Collins & Aikman bonds reflects the increasing maturity of the credit derivatives market. It also highlights the fact that index trading has outpaced the availability of underlying bonds, making physical settlement sometimes impossible.Buying a single-company CDS is equivalent to buying insurance against that company’s default. A CDS index product covers a basket of companies – 100 in the Dow Jones CDX North American High Yield index, for example.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association proposed the settlement procedure last month after Collins & Aikman’s default, the first by a CDS index constituent in years. Besides allowing for cash settlement, it established the auction process. ISDA said on Monday that more than 450 firms had signed up for its protocol.“It ran absolutely perfectly,” said Kevin Gould of Markit Group, which administered the auction jointly with Creditex.Thirteen dealers participated in a “very orderly, very smooth” process, according to Mr Gould.The corporate default rate has been unusually low in recent months. However, market participants expect it to rise in coming years,The price for Collins & Aikman’s bonds maturing in December 2011 was determined to be 43.625.
1101;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Derivatives ‘fixing’ to spur growth;;"The launch of a credit derivatives “fixing” marks a coming of age for the fastest-growing sector of the derivatives industry and should provide a platform for further growth.Credit derivatives join such longstanding markets as silver and gold that have had fixings since 1897 and 1919 respectively. Interest rates acquired a daily fixing in January 1986 when the British Bankers’ Association created Libor, the London inter-bank offered rate.A fixing will give investors the reassurance that the prices they are being quoted are close to the going rate and will boost trading in financial products that require an independently verifiable benchmark.Trading in interest rate swaps – which allow investors to exchange fixed for variable rates of interest and vice versa – has risen nearly threefold to $183,600bn in the past three years. Growth of credit default swaps – the most common form of credit derivative – has been increasing even more rapidly, but remains only 4.5 per cent of the size of the interest rate swap market.The new credit derivatives fixings relate to the iTraxx family of CDS indices that were created by a merger of two competing indices – iBoxx and Trac-x – last April.Fixings will initially be calculated weekly, at 11am GMT on Friday, on three iTraxx indices: the iTraxx Europe index, based on 125 investment grade companies; the HiVol index, which reflects the 30 most volatile CDSs; and the Crossover index, reflecting CDSs on 35 companies whose credit ratings sit on the cusp of investment and non-investment grade.There will also be an additional fixing at the quarterly “roll” date when the futures markets update their contracts.The inaugural public fixing – following six months of trials – took place on Monday, which was one of the quarterly roll dates. Sixteen banks submitted prices on the electronic trading platform operated by Creditex. The prices are verified and distributed on a website – www.creditfixings.com – maintained by Markit, a provider of credit data.Prices are submitted by traders over a two-minute period and a bid, offer and mid price are calculated electronically at the end of that time. To ensure that traders do not submit “rogue” prices that flatter their own positions, they are required to trade if the bid and offer prices match or if the bid price exceeds the offer price. In addition, these prices are not included in the calculation of the fixing.On Monday, two sets of prices fell into this category, triggering trades on the Crossover and Europe indices of €10m and €25m respectively.“If a bid price is greater than the offer, this leads to an automatic trade,” said Mazy Dar, head of electronic platforms at Creditex. “This creates a penalty for anyone trying to skew the market.”Before the creation of the fixing, investors had to rely on the dealing bank providing prices.“We have had to act as calculation agents,” said Anthony Nahum, head of European exotic credit derivatives at Citigroup. “We would calculate our own fixing and give it to the counterparty. [If this was not acceptable] it would go to a poll of dealers, but this was administratively cumbersome.”Fixings have begun with just three indices with a five-year maturity, but additional maturities and sectoral indices could be added later. Fixings could also take place on individual credit derivatives if there was enough demand, said Lee McGinty, head of credit derivatives research at JPMorgan.One constraint on expansion is the ability and willingness of traders to input all the prices at fixing time. But this would not prevent the extension of fixings from Europe to the iTraxx indices in the US and Asia.The banks believe that a fixing will promote the next wave of more complex credit derivatives.“This is the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle for second-generation credit products,” said Kevin Gould, executive vice-president of Markit.A more distant aim of the credit derivatives industry is for the index fixings to become the basis for pricing new bond issues. “I could link the coupon on my bonds to the difference between my spread and the spread of the general market index,” said Pierre Mathieu, head of European credit trading at BNP Paribas.This could lead to an issuer whose CDSs outperformed the market paying a lower coupon on its debt.But before this can happen, the fixing has to become as established a feature of the credit market as its counterparts in silver, gold and interest rates."
1102;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2005-03-21T18:47:11Z;‘Fixing’ gets off with a hitch;;A sluggish computer disrupted the launch of the first credit derivatives “fixing” on Monday as the display screen at the official ceremony in a London hotel stayed frozen for most of the two-minute fixing period.Dealers around the world had full view of the prices filed in the run-up to the 4pm fixing but bankers and press at the official launch saw only the final 30 seconds of the process because of a technical glitch.The first public fixing marked the conclusion of nearly a year of discussions and testing. Despite the glitch, the promoters said the fixing had demonstrated the robustness of the pricing process. Sixteen banks submitted quotes with wide bid-offer spreads that reflected the volatility of the underlying markets.The fixing is intended to provide an independent benchmark of the price of the iTraxx indices of European credit default swaps. It is hoped that this will give investors greater confidence in the prices they are quoted and so boost trading volumes.It will also provide a reference point for pricing more complex credit derivatives.A total of 19 banks have agreed to provide prices for the electronic credit derivative trading platform operated by Creditex. The prices will be verified and disseminated by Markit, a provider of credit data.To prevent individual banks providing inaccurate prices that might favour their own positions, dealers are required to trade at the price submitted if the bid-offer quotes match, or at the mid-point if the bid price exceeds the offer price. In addition, these prices are excluded from the calculation of the fixing.
1103;INFO;IHS Markit Ltd;2004-12-08T20:52:59Z;CDS to get regular price fixings;;"Plans are under way to introduce regular price fixings to the credit derivatives market, replicating the model used in the much bigger market for interest rate derivatives.Practitioners hope that broadly agreed prices will help credit eventually to rival the interest rate market, currently 20 to 30 times the size. In terms of notional values of contracts traded, credit derivatives are worth about $5,000bn globally but growing rapidly, while interest rate derivatives are worth about $140,000bn.Credit default swaps, the cornerstone of credit derivatives, give investors exposure to the corporate credit market without buying specific bonds. They help bring liquidity to a market that is huge in terms of outstanding issues but bedevilled by lack of tradability.CDS indices with broad market recognition were launched earlier this year and have rapidly grown in use. But the market is still dependent on individual banks for index prices, in other words the spread at which the index is trading.Market participants led by Markit, a UK-based data provider, and Creditex, a New York-based specialist broker, are working on a plan to introduce regular fixings along the lines used in the interest rate market.Sunil Hirani, chief executive of Creditex, says the plan is to go live in the first quarter of next year.Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, said: ""The number one concern is creation of a transparent process where the end-result is a true market level that should be tradable.""Although Markit already creates end of day fixings, these are not tradable - that is, prices at which banks would be willing to trade.Their model for price fixings is the London interbank offered rate (Libor), the short-term interest rate at which commercial banks agree to lend to each other. Libor is used as a benchmark around the world, including in the US. Price fixings also take place in other markets such as gold.Eighteen banks are supplying prices for the CDS index market. Trial fixings so far have been weekly, although Libor is fixed on a daily basis.Tim Frost, a board member of Creditex and a founder of Cairn Financial Products, said: ""We believe this is sufficient for current needs. But I wouldn't rule out a move to daily in the fullness of time.""Another difference is that Libor is still calculated by brokers phoning round the market during the five minutes prior to 11am each day. The CDS fixings are being obtained automatically from the prices being seen on electronic platforms.Mr Hirani adds: ""Fixings will bring confidence to the CDS market, attracting new players. It will also enable the development of second generation products.""These include futures and options on CDS indices. There has also been talk that these could lead to listed, exchange-traded products, although exchanges have gone quiet on such hopes.Some investment banks may prefer to keep any trading over-the-counter, where they can reap a greater share of the profits. Plans for fixings are more developed for Europe than the US.Mr Frost said: ""There has been more receptiveness to change in Europe. European regulations require observable, tradable prices for structured products before they can be sold to retail investors.""The CDS index series for European corporate credit, iTraxx Europe, has attracted more trading volume than CDX North America, its equivalent in the US. But work on fixings has started in the US as well.Ian Clague, managing director of credit derivatives operations at brokerage GFI in New York, said: ""It's a very valuable process. It sets a fair price for the index or reference entity credits and becomes possible to cash-settle.""Further out, Mr Hirani says that there could be fixings on individual corporate credit spreads, which would set an agreed price at which that company could borrow in the capital markets.Mr Frost adds that fixings would play a valuable role in the development of the constant maturity CDS market.Most CDS contracts have a five-year maturity. A constant maturity CDS is where the repayments are periodically set to some prevailing CDS rate, for example the five-year CDS spread prevailing at each six-monthly payment date."
