0;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-01-09T10:00:26Z;Voya Financial held talks over sale to insurance groups;AIG, Principal and Prudential Financial considered takeover of US retirement plan provider;Voya Financial has explored selling itself and held discussions with a number of companies potentially interested in buying the US retirement plan provider, according to people briefed on the matter.Voya held talks late last year with insurer AIG, asset manager Principal Financial Group and life insurance and retirement plan provider Prudential Financial, among others.The talks did not lead to a deal, although the Voya board remains open to a sale and may explore the matter again this year, the people said.A takeover could value Voya at $10bn or more, above its current $8bn market capitalisation, one of the people added.Voya said it did not comment on rumour or speculation. AIG, Principal and Prudential declined to comment.While the Voya brand — drawn from the word voyage — was only created in the past decade, the company’s roots date back to the 1970s when ING Group predecessor Nationale-Nederlanden expanded into the US life insurance market. The Dutch banking and insurance group made a string of US acquisitions before being devastated by the financial crisis.ING required a €10bn bailout in 2008 and was subsequently forced by the European Commission to offload assets. Voya was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013 as part of those divestitures.Voya has changed dramatically since then under Rodney Martin, chief executive, who joined in 2011 from AIG. Like other life insurers, Voya has spent the past few years ridding itself of capital-intensive businesses, many of which involved offering financial guarantees to customers.Two years ago Voya sold its annuity business to a consortium led by private equity group Apollo. And in December it sold another $1.25bn block of life insurance business to Resolution, a company led by insurance entrepreneur Clive Cowdery. Goldman Sachs advised Voya on the sale of that unit.Suneet Kamath, an analyst with Citi, said the transaction transformed Voya into “one of the cleanest, simplest stories” that he tracks covering the life insurance business. He added: “What we like in life isn’t really life.”Voya could now be more attractive to a buyer that wants to focus on the capital-light markets in which the company has specialised. Voya shares surged to a high after the group announced the December sale, which left the company focused on its three remaining business lines: retirement, investment management and employee benefits plans.Potential acquirers include US life insurers and asset managers who are trying to focus on the same markets, as well as overseas companies who want to tap into the potential growth in demand for US retirement products as the population ages.
1;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2018-11-13T11:22:18Z;Sushil Wadhwani hedge fund sold to Prudential Financial;Acquisition comes amid renewed interest in quantitative investment managers;US insurer Prudential Financial’s funds arm is to buy former Bank of England policymaker Sushil Wadhwani’s computer-driven hedge fund, the latest move in a land grab for quantitative investing.Wadhwani Asset Management will become part of QMA, the quant unit of Prudential’s funds arm PGIM, although the London-based hedge fund will operate independently, QMA said on Tuesday. Mr Wadhwani, who has previously worked at Goldman Sachs and hedge funds Tudor and Caxton, will continue as chief investment officer.The acquisition comes amid a renewed wave of interest in quant funds, even though the performance of many of these portfolios has been lacklustre of late.Investors have been hunting for new trading techniques less dependent on the skill and whims of an individual trader and more on emotionless algorithms. Since the start of 2016 investors have poured $25.2bn into quant funds, even as they have withdrawn $71.4bn from the wider hedge fund industry, according to data group HFR. But some quant funds have struggled in markets dominated by central bank stimulus that often lack the long-lasting trends or volatility on which they like to trade.Wadhwani Asset Management, which runs $1.4bn in assets and which names its funds after economist John Maynard Keynes, has itself found returns hard to come by. Its $666m Keynes Multi Asset Value AMX fund is down 12.8 per cent in the year to the end of October, having lost 3 per cent last year, according to numbers sent to investors and seen by the Financial Times. However, its Leveraged Quantitative Strategies fund scored double-digit gains in 2014.While there have very recently been signs that funds’ poor returns are finally damping demand from some investors, large asset managers are still keen to snap up the intellectual property they believe will be of greater value in more favourable market conditions. Swiss money manager GAM Holding, for instance, agreed to buy Cambridge-based Cantab Capital in 2016 and has been among the many firms launching new computer-driven funds.In addition, US-based asset managers have been looking abroad as a way of diversifying away from what they view as highly competitive US markets dominated by algorithmic traders and into markets they see as offering greater opportunities for profit.Andrew Dyson, QMA chief executive who first met Mr Wadhwani in the 1990s when Mr Wadhwani was working at Goldman Sachs and Mr Dyson was at consultancy Mercer, said he had been looking for ways to broaden QMA’s US-focused client base.Wadhwani Asset Management, which was set up in 2002, tries to profit from following market trends while also analysing investor behaviour to calculate if markets have under-reacted or over-reacted to news. For instance, around the end of September the firm’s systems indicated that global equity markets had not fully priced in negative news about Italy’s plans to increase spending sharply. That was a factor in the firm cutting exposure to stocks shortly before October’s sharp sell-off.The deal is set to close in the first quarter of next year, QMA said. It did not disclose the price it was paying.Despite quant funds’ recent poor returns, Mr Dyson said he and Mr Wadhwani expected the “very unusual period” of benign equity markets to end, which could benefit these strategies.“We feel there’s a lot more volatility in equity and bond markets to come,” he said. “People have forgotten these markets can be volatile.”

It can also mean a lapse. The decision this week by America’s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to free the last of the big non-banks from heightened regulatory supervision could turn out to be a blunder.The council was put together by the US Treasury department in the wake of the financial crisis to keep an eye on vulnerabilities in financial markets that had suddenly been thrust into the spotlight. If regulators were going to tighten capital, liquidity and reporting standards on the likes of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, the argument went, they should also do so on the biggest non-banks that were woven into the fabric of the financial ecosystem.Starting the list of “systemically important financial institutions” with AIG was straightforward enough. For a while, notes Capital Alpha, it was a fun parlour game around Washington, guessing which giant asset managers, hedge funds or private equity firms might join it and GE Capital on the list.The project began to unravel when insurer MetLife sued the government in 2015, saying its SIFI designation was unfair. GE Capital then shrank enough to lose its label. AIG followed it last year, arguing that credit markets were doing a good enough job of keeping executives in check through the discipline of bond spreads. Having just one SIFI still on the list — Prudential Financial, a Newark-based insurer — was looking a little strange, even if the company’s assets had grown almost a fifth while under FSOC review.Reviewing Obama-era protections is sensible; much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, drawn up in haste and confusion, may have overshot. But undermining FSOC is still hazardous. One of the main factors behind the crisis, after all, was regulatory blind spots. New York’s uber-regulator, the Department of Financial Services, was created from a recognition that the predecessor bodies covering banking and insurance barely talked to each other.Treasury secretary and FSOC chair Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman banker, says he wants to focus on risky activities rather than risky companies. But it is unclear that he has the appetite to do so. Meetings of the council are running shorter and shorter; the last was adjourned after 26 minutes. That suggests mounting complacency, deep into a bull market. An image of an FSOC spinning its wheels, without a single institution to fasten on to, is not a comforting one.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

3;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2018-10-17T12:44:40Z;Prudential Financial taken off US ‘too big to fail’ list;Ending of extra-close supervision further undermines Obama-era post-crisis regulation;Washington is ending its “too big to fail” supervision of Prudential Financial, further undermining the post-crisis financial regulatory regime introduced by former President Barack Obama.A body of senior officials led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voted to drop additional regulatory scrutiny of Prudential, the largest US insurer by assets.Prudential was the last insurance group to remain on a list of non-bank companies deemed “systemically important”, a label that carries extra-close supervision by the Federal Reserve. Officials had considered the company so large and complex that its collapse would endanger financial stability.“We are pleased with this decision, which affirms our longstanding belief that Prudential never met the standard for designation,” Prudential said.“This outcome reflects Prudential’s sustainable business model, capital strength and comprehensive risk management, which have and continue to enable us to fulfil our promises to our customers, deliver consistent performance and meet regulatory obligations.”The decision in effect kills off a main plank of the Dodd-Frank reforms, which were designed to make the financial system safer after the bailout in 2008 of AIG.Officials had already rescinded AIG’s too-big-to-fail status, agreeing with the insurer that it had become smaller and less risky since the crisis. MetLife was also freed from the regulations after a court found regulators had failed to follow proper procedure when they designated it. But Prudential was still subjected to the regime even after its two rivals escaped it.$190bnGrowth of Prudential Financial’s total assets over the past six yearsIn contrast to AIG and MetLife, Prudential has expanded since the crisis. Its total assets have risen by about $190bn over the past six years. As well as its life insurance and annuity operations the New Jersey-based group is also the world’s ninth-biggest asset manager. It employs about 50,000 people.The Trump administration has been critical of post-crisis financial regulation, blaming it for crimping economic growth, and has been sympathetic to industry arguments that the too-big-to-fail designations are too crude.Unlike systemically important banks, whose designation is set in law as part of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank reforms, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has discretion to determine whether other companies should carry the label.The council is comprised mainly of the heads of top regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Designations require a two-thirds majority vote, although the Treasury Secretary, who chairs FSOC, has veto powers.Systemically important institutions are supposed to be subjected to higher capital requirements. They also must provide regulators with a “living will” to demonstrate how they would be wound up in a crisis.The Treasury says, however, that a designation does not bring with it any new access to government liquidity sources or guarantee any bailout.
4;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2018-06-13T00:06:20Z;Big banks slip into bear market territory as rates rise;Sixteen global financial companies are down more than 20 per cent from peaks;More than a dozen of the world’s biggest banks have slipped into a bear market, highlighting risks to the global economy even as equity indices reach new highs and the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates.Investors on Tuesday sent the Nasdaq to a record close on the eve of a meeting at which the Fed is expected to lift rates for a seventh time since the end of 2015. But strategists note that beneath the bright economic data and rising benchmarks, strains have begun to emerge among a group of banks and insurers deemed to be critical to the health of the global financial system.Among the 39 “Sifis”, financial institutions considered systemically important by the Basel-based Financial Stability Board, 16 are down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks in dollar terms, meeting the standard definition of a bear market.They are Deutsche Bank, Nordea, ICBC, UniCredit, Crédit Agricole, ING, Santander, Société Générale, BNP Paribas, UBS, Agricultural Bank of China, AXA, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Bank of China, Credit Suisse and Prudential Financial.If these banks are supposed to be systemically important then policymakers ought to be watching them to see what is happeningThe synchronised dips were a sign of global financial stress, said Ian Harnett, managing director of global strategy at Absolute Strategy Research in London, who this week used the data to send out his first “Black Swan” alert since 2009.At some point, he said, central bankers might have to respond to bearish signals from almost half the global Sifis, rather than continuing to tighten monetary policy.“The clue is in the name,” he said. “If these banks are supposed to be systemically important then policymakers ought to be watching them to see what is happening.”The Fed’s gradual interest rate increases — more recently coupled with shrinking its balance sheet by shedding bonds acquired in its crisis-fighting “quantitative easing” programme — have begun to ripple through financial markets, pushing up short-term borrowing costs for households, companies and banks.The three-month Libor rate, the rate at which banks lend dollars to each other, climbed to a 10-year high of 2.37 per cent in May, and although the rate has since dipped slightly to 2.33 per cent, analysts say that the dollar funding market is noticeably tighter of late.The spread between Libor and the “overnight index swap” rate, a gauge for the future expected level of the Fed’s base interest rates, is another popular measure of stresses in the banking sector. Although the Libor-OIS spread has slipped from the highs touched in April — when US companies were repatriating dollars held overseas and depleting the available short-term funding for banks — it remains at about twice the post-crisis average.What many of the harder-hit Sifi banks have in common, said Mr Harnett, was a heavy dependence on US-dollar funding, putting them at risk of a squeeze if US rates continue to rise and the dollar continues to strengthen. Banks in Canada, Australia and Sweden, in particular, came through the last crisis in relatively good shape, thanks largely to their exposures to China and a strong commodities market. But in the years since then, the banks had overextended, he said, trying to support rapid asset growth with wholesale funding, rather than traditional deposits.The alert he put out on Monday was his first since a warning on inflationary risks in June 2009, as oil prices climbed higher. Mr Harnett drew parallels to another bearish note he wrote in March 2007, when European banks began to sink while non-banks marched higher.There were 30 banks ranked as “GSIBs” — global systemically important banks — by the FSB last November, including JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets. The nine insurers classed as critical to the world’s financial system include AIG, Allianz, Ping An and Prudential of the UK.The big dips in the Sifis’ stock prices were ominous, said Bert Ely, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a principal of Ely & Company. He noted bullish remarks from Jamie Dimon on CNBC last week, when the JPMorgan chief celebrated strong consumer and business sentiment and said he could find no “real potholes” in the outlook.“The good news does not last for ever,” he said. “Those kind of comments are usually just before things start heading down.”

If these efforts were unsuccessful, the company presumed the individuals would never be found.As a result, the insurer mistakenly released funds from reserves that support future annuity payouts. The problem was brought to the attention of Michel Khalaf, recently appointed head of Metlife’s US division, in October.The second-biggest US insurer by assets has had to provision $510m to account for the unpaid annuities. It has turned to location professionals at California-based Pension Benefit Information to help find the lost retirees by the summer.Staff are also using the public records specialist Accurint, a division of LexisNexis, and have launched a campaign of phone calls and certified mailings. Retirees who they manage to locate will be due a lump sum to compensate for missing back payments.In a hint that employees might lose jobs over the episode, Steven Kandarian, chairman and chief executive, said managers were “taking action to hold people accountable”.To date, MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell shortMr Kandarian — the former head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that safeguards retirement schemes — said the episode was “especially distressing to me” and “deeply embarrassing”.Shareholders in MetLife have taken fright at the reserve charge and the threat to its reputation. Shares have fallen 14 per cent since the company warned two weeks ago it would need to book a charge of more than half a billion dollars to cover the unmet obligations.The mishap has prompted investors to question other US insurers about their practices. Mark Grier, vice-chairman of Prudential Financial, said last week that the debacle at MetLife was “certainly getting a lot of attention”.“There are inevitably some customers we can’t locate for a number of reasons, but that number is small,” he said, adding he was “comfortable” the company was “meeting our obligations”.As part of efforts to ensure the episode does not happen again, MetLife said it would now start sending annual letters to workers once they turned 55. They would send three letters as soon as they reached 65, including a certified mailing.Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services are investigating.Mr Kandarian said: “To date, MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell short.”

9;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2018-01-19T05:02:52Z;Trump administration drops appeal in Metlife ‘too big to fail’ case;;The Trump administration is dropping an appeal against a contentious legal ruling that ended Metlife’s designation as “too big to fail”, further undermining a financial safety regime established under President Obama.Almost two years ago a district court sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Washington when it threw out the authorities’ labelling of MetLife as a “systemically important financial institution” (Sifi) that needed tougher regulation.The government appealed, arguing Metlife was clearly a large, interconnected financial institution whose failure would threaten financial stability.However, the Trump administration has targetted the Sifi regime as part of its deregulatory push. On Thursday a council led by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin filed a motion to dismiss the case.Last year it dropped AIG’s designation. Prudential Financial is the only remaining non-bank Sifi in the US.Ian Katz, policy analyst at Capital Alpha, said he also sees Prudential’s “escape from the Sifi dungeon” as “inevitable”.“It’s mainly a matter of Prudential going through the bureaucratic process required by [the council's]rules.”In a sign officials want to limit the wider legal ramifications of the original Metlife judgement, however, both the company and the government asked the court to “vacate” a part of its ruling. The court had concluded officials should have undertaken a “cost-benefit analysis” when designating MetLife, a decision lawyers warned could undermine bureaucratic decision making.
11;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2017-08-04T15:11:51Z;Wall St weighs in on US jobs, wages;;The US economy posted another strong month of job gains but its the wage growth that economists and markets are focused on.For now they expect the strong hiring is enough to keep the Federal Reserve on course to begin tightening monetary policy as early as September and lift rates one more time this year. However, they argue that policymakers are likely to be cautious about any future rate rises unless wages accelerate.Steve Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard, said while the improvement in wages was rooted in low wage jobs that is unlikely to prompt the Fed to stray from the plans. He said:The Fed looks at employment in the aggregate and what it will see in the July data is reason enough to keep with their forecasts and, by extension, their plans to begin balance sheet reduction in October and raise the funds rate another 25bp in December. The great deceleration in hiring that began at the beginning of 2015 and ran through 2016 is now done with, monthly private sector job gains are settling in at an average of around 180,000.The view was echoed by Quincy Crosby, strategist at Prudential Financial, who noted that wages would need to pick up at a faster clip to cement the odds of a rate rise.From a macroeconomic perspective what does this mean for monetary policy with expectations for another rate hike this year— this report should move projections above the 50 percent mark, but there needs to be more evidence off higher inflation to get to a 90 percent chance of one more rate hike.Joshua Shapiro, economist at MFR, like others argues that July’s report is unlikely to change the mindset of Fed policymakers. However, he expects the Fed to be cautious about further rate rises if wage costs don’t pick up.We still expect labor costs to accelerate in the quarters ahead. However, given that recent data on this front have been much tamer than models anticipate given the low unemployment rate, forecasts of acceleration are not likely to prove sufficient for monetary policymakers. Until core inflation in general and labor costs in particular begin to accelerate, the FOMC is likely to be very cautious concerning further rate increases.Joseph Song, economist at Bank of America, argued that the July report was “positive across the board” but pointed to the Phillips Curve puzzle.The fact that the unemployment rate continues to slide without acceleration in wages remains a puzzle. This could reflect a variety of factors including low productivity growth, employee insecurity about the health of the labor market, skill mismatch and sector specific stories. These factors likely will continue to be in play, but we think that it is only a matter of time before there is a modest move higher in wage growth. The bigger uncertainty is whether or not this translates to consumer price inflation.

David McCann, analyst at Numis, added that this was “an extremely small amount [of asset gathering] for a business of its size”.Smaller rivals Jupiter and Ashmore posted net inflows of £3.6bn and $2.7bn respectively over the same period, while German competitors Deutsche Asset Management and Union Investment have each pulled in more than €10bn since the start of the year.Peter Harrison, Schroders chief executive, said the company’s efforts to strengthen its US presence, through a distribution deal with Pennsylvania-based asset manager Hartford Funds and by expanding its sales team, would generate “more momentum to come”.“We will get one-off outflows when you have lumpy sub-advised mandates. That is disappointing but I take comfort from the underlying dynamics which are positive,” he said. “We have made really good progress on a number of different areas.”Despite the muted inflows, Schroders reported a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £342m compared with the same period last year.The London-based company’s assets under management and advice jumped to an all-time high of £418bn, while net income was up 17 per cent to £974m. Positive market movements accounted for more than 90 per cent of the increase in net income.Peter Lenardos, analyst at RBC, the bank, said: “Today’s results are good and above expectations. Cost control is better than anticipated and wealth management is the bright spot, delivering robust profitability and net inflows.”Schroders increased its interim dividend by 17 per cent to 34p per share. Its share price was up nearly 2 per cent by early afternoon trading.
13;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2017-03-19T11:05:28Z;Athene on the hunt for deals among hard-pressed European insurers;A lot of challenged companies out there, says chief executive James Belardi;Athene is on the hunt for deals in Europe as the recently floated US pensions provider looks to take advantage of the pressure on life insurance companies caused by ultra low interest rates.James Belardi, chief executive, said Athene, backed by private equity group Apollo, was eyeing acquisitions in Germany as well as reinsurance transactions in the UK.“There’s a reason we’ve received a lot of calls about potential acquisition opportunities,” he said. “There’s a lot of challenged companies out there that would like a well-capitalised parent to come in.”Mr Belardi’s comments signal that prospective buyers are gearing up to consolidate the fragmented industry. Clive Cowdery, the British life insurance dealmaker, is also known to be interested in pursuing deals in Europe.Life and pension companies globally are suffering as their business models require them to invest heavily in bonds, whose prospective returns have dropped in the easy money era.The difficulties are particularly acute in European markets including Germany, where until recently the industry has been making generous long-term promises on payouts to customers.German life companies must generate an average return on their investments of 2.4 per cent to meet the promises, which typically stretch out over 16 years, according to rating agency Fitch.Although the companies are making returns at 3.3 per cent on investments made when yields were higher, they face a tightening squeeze because of low rates.Backers of Athene say it has an advantage over rivals because it is based in low-tax Bermuda, has picked up other acquisitions — including the US business of UK insurer Aviva — on the cheap, and gets Apollo to manage its investments.The group was valued at $7.4bn in a New York listing in December that raised about $1.1bn for selling shareholders led by Apollo. Its shares have since risen to value it at $10.9bn.Athene has been expanding rapidly since it was formed in 2009 to capitalise on problems in the US market after the financial crisis. Figures published on Friday by trade body Limra show it has become the third-biggest provider of “fixed indexed annuities” in the US.The group purchased Delta Lloyd’s German unit in 2015 but has yet to expand further in Europe. “There’s a lot of opportunities for additional acquisitions in Germany, as well as reinsurance opportunities in the UK,” Mr Belardi said.The group would be taking on so-called longevity risk — the risk that customers live longer than expected. Mr Belardi added that Athene was planning to raise capital from third-party investors “to pursue opportunities” in Germany but would not provide further details.The M&A market for European annuities is growing. Regulatory changes and rising life expectancy are encouraging corporate pension schemes, as well as insurers, to pass on these liabilities to specialists. Last year Dutch insurer Aegon sold £9bn worth of UK annuities to Rothesay Life and Legal & General.There’s a lot of opportunities for additional acquisitions in Germany, as well as reinsurance opportunities in the UKEuropean insurers complain that the introduction of the EU’s Solvency II capital rules has made it more difficult to sell such long-term products. They are looking at passing risks over to counterparts based in Bermuda and the US, where Solvency II does not apply.Athene’s chief has said the group has $2.5bn of firepower for acquisitions. It has been linked with a possible purchase of the US insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life, and is also seeking to take on risks from pension plans in the US.John Barnidge, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said Athene was unusual in the US sector in eyeing European expansion. He noted the bigger operators MetLife and Prudential Financial had been grappling with toughened regulations that have curtailed their M&A ambitions.“There aren’t a lot of people going over there,” he said.
14;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2017-02-15T06:24:05Z;Accounting standards in the spotlight as life insurers take strain;Charges at MetLife and Prudential Financial have put emphasis on need for reform;Life insurers were supposed to win big from the US election result in November. So investors were taken off guard when MetLife, the largest US life insurer by assets, this month unveiled its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade.Donald Trump’s victory and the prospect of reflationary economic policies sent long-term interest rates sharply higher — offering relief to insurers, whose profits have been hurt by ultra-low bond yields.But instead of bolstering MetLife’s earnings, the swings in financial markets forced the company to book a $3.2bn hit in its derivatives portfolio and pushed it to a $2.1bn net loss for the fourth quarter.John Hele, chief financial officer, sought to reassure investors that accounting “noise” was largely to blame.“Rising interest rates remain favourable for MetLife over the longer term,” he said. The results nevertheless knocked $3.1bn off the group’s market capitalisation.MetLife was not the only US life insurer whose earnings were hurt by the post-election market movements.Prudential Financial, the second biggest, took a $1.28bn hit, largely related to an opaque charge in its annuities business that several analysts said had little or no real bearing on the business. It pushed net income down from $740m a year ago to $293m.The red ink throws into sharp relief problems with accounting in the sector. Fund managers, analysts and executives complain financial results are often not very meaningful — especially as measured by the standard US framework, generally accepted accounting principles.“A lot depends on assumptions — such as how long people are going to live, and the return on the assets,” said Chris Davis, chairman of Davis Advisors, an investment management house with more than $25bn in assets under management.“A lot of investors don’t want to do the work to understand insurance accounting, especially in life.”Rick Sojkowski, insurance partner at Deloitte & Touche, said: “There’s some level of apprehension about investing in the industry, given the models and complexity of understanding the accounting.”To be sure, MetLife’s loss, which was much bigger than anything it booked during the financial crisis, cannot be dismissed entirely as an accounting eccentricity. The difficulty for investors is working out how much of it reflects reality.The $3.2bn charge arose because the insurer has made extensive use of derivatives to minimise the pain caused by depressed bond yields.These hedging positions have protected MetLife’s profits in the post-crisis era of easy money and generate about $200m of pre-tax income per quarter, according to Wells Fargo Securities. As yields rise, however, the derivatives produce less income.Mr Hele told investors that even if interest rates were to increase 1 percentage point, which should boost insurers’ bottom lines by increasing the income they get from their investments, MetLife’s operating profits would be flat this year.Earnings would not benefit from such a rate rise until 2018. For critics, that is a problem. The company is now reviewing its hedging strategy.At the same time, there is no dispute that the accounting has made the phenomenon appear much bigger than it actually is.Different accounting standards apply to insurers’ derivatives and their liabilities — the policies they have written, such as life insurance and annuities.There’s some level of apprehension about investing in the industry, given the models and complexity of understanding the accountingDerivatives are marked to market, meaning the values booked on insurers’ balance sheets can swing from quarter to quarter.In contrast, liabilities appear on the books to be a lot more static. In accounting for liabilities, insurers are required to lock in assumptions that were made when the contracts were written, on a range of variables ranging from death rates to interest rates.The discrepancy means that when interest rates rise, the costs to insurers — lower derivative values — show up in GAAP net income, but the benefits do not. In reality, insurers benefit from rising interest rates, but the accounts may not reflect it.Such is the indifference on Wall Street about the value of insurers’ GAAP net income that few sellside analysts normally pay much attention to it.For MetLife, only one broker provided estimates for the metric to Bloomberg for the quarter. The analyst had pencilled in a profit of $1.38bn — a forecast that turned out to be wildly inaccurate.In contrast, 10 sellside brokers gave figures for “adjusted” fourth quarter net income, which strips out several accounting items.“There’s so many things that cause swings and in some cases they are not representative of the real earnings power of the company,” said Ryan Krueger, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Still, Erik Bass, partner at Autonomous Research, said: “This past quarter, below-the-line noise has re-emerged as a concern for some insurance investors.”[New proposals to revamp accounting practices could end up replacing] one level of noise for anotherReforms are on the cards that could make GAAP figures more meaningful. The Financial Accounting Standards Board put forward proposals in September that would revamp accounting practices in the sector.Under the mooted changes, the assumptions that underpin the value of the insurance liabilities would need to be tracked in the accounts on a more regular basis.Big questions remain about how that would work in practice, however — particularly how the assumptions should be calculated.The danger, said Robert Falzon, Prudential Financial’s chief financial officer, is that the proposals could end up replacing “one level of noise for another”.“The concept makes a lot of sense,” Mr Hele of MetLife added. “The devil’s in the details.”

16;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-12-13T17:36:19Z;Prudential Financial in spotlight over Wells Fargo relationship;Episode highlights risks insurers run as they try out alternative sales methods;The scandal over sham accounts at Wells Fargo has already prompted scrutiny of sales practices in US banking. Now the insurance industry is under the spotlight.Prudential Financial has been drawn into the debacle, saying this week it was suspending a distribution deal with Wells as the second-largest US insurer by assets examines how its life policies were sold by the bank.Other corporate partners of Wells, which has acknowledged that thousands of its staff may have resorted to fraud in an effort to meet sales targets, also may have been affected.Wells said it had temporarily stopped sales of renters’ insurance, which is provided by Assurant, as it conducts “a complete review of our online insurance product referrals”. Assurant declined to comment.The developments highlight the risks that insurers run as they experiment with different distribution methods.In a lawsuit filed this week, lawyers acting for a Wells customer, Alex Perea, argued that he had been a victim of “financial fraud orchestrated” by Prudential. They want it to be granted class action status.The lawsuit said he had received a “threatening collections letter” from Prudential even though “at no time did Mr Perea approve, sign up for or enter an agreement for” a policy from the insurer. Prudential “misled” and “stonewalled” customers who made inquiries about premium charges, it alleged.Prudential said it believes the suit “is totally without merit and will vigorously defend itself in the appropriate legal venue. We remain squarely focused on doing what is right for our customers.”The tie-up between Prudential and Wells had brought together two of the best known names in American finance.For years, life insurers have been seeking to find ways to combat a decades-long decline in demand for traditional coverage, which pays out to loved ones if the policyholder dies within a specified timeframe.Cover provided by employers, known as group life, has held up, but most of the US population no longer have individual policies. The take-up rate has fallen to 44 per cent, the lowest since the trade body Limra began tracking the data in 1960. Almost a third of the population has no coverage of any type.Distribution costs, meanwhile, are high for the industry. Face-to-face sales by agents — employed either directly by insurers or by independent brokers — still dominate.In many ways the big life insurance companies have moved on, selling a range of saving and investment products as well as annuities, which are designed to protect policyholders against living longer, not shorter than, expected.Meanwhile, the industry has been trying out alternative and lower cost ways to distribute traditional life insurance. MetLife experimented with self-service stations in Walmart. Protective Life Insurance Company has an arrangement with Costco, which runs warehouse-style discount stores.In contrast to other parts of the world, banks play only a very small role.It was in this context that Prudential struck a deal with Wells in the summer of 2014 to sell a simple type of life cover, called MyTerm. Customers could buy the policies using self-service kiosks in the bank’s branches. Applications could be made in just 15 minutes.It was a far cry from the large “bancassurance” partnerships seen in other markets. In Asia, for instance, banks including Citigroup and HSBC have struck a series of multibillion-dollar distribution deals with insurers such as AIA and Allianz.In June this year Prudential expanded MyTerm with more policy options, including an addition that could trigger a payout before death if the policyholder was diagnosed with a terminal illness.About 15,000 of the streamlined Prudential policies were sold through Wells since the launch. That still represents less than 1 per cent of the group’s US life premiums, although Wells was the insurer’s biggest corporate partner for MyTerm policy by far.The deal came to an abrupt end this week, when Prudential suspended the arrangement.The decision came just days after a lawsuit was filed by three of the insurer’s former employees. They alleged that low-income Wells customers, who spoke little or no English, had been signed up for Prudential policies in a similar way to how consumers had sham bank accounts created fraudulently on their behalf.The bank’s branch workers were not permitted to sell insurance directly, although Wells confirmed this week that steering customers towards the Prudential insurance coverage had been part of the criteria used to determine staff pay levels. The bank has since scrapped the incentive scheme.According to the lawsuit, some customers had been subscribed with suspicious email addresses, such as “noemail@wellsfargo.com”.Insurance regulators in California, where Wells is based, and in New Jersey, where Prudential is headquartered, have launched investigations.Wells is still reeling from the sales scandal. The bank has lost its status as the world’s most valuable as result of the episode, which cost its former chief executive John Stumpf his job.Although shares in Prudential dropped 1.4 per cent on Monday, there were signs the insurance group could contain the fallout.Analysts have a chance to grill the insurer’s senior managers later this week, when it is scheduled to announce its annual financial targets.Deep Banerjee and Anthony Beato, analysts at S&P Global Ratings, said in a note they expected “limited contagion impact on Prudential Financial’s overall brand, reputation, and financial profile”, pointing to the small proportion of business generated from the Wells relationship.Still, they added: “This is based on our assumption that [it] was not complicit in any sales misconduct.”

It said there were a “large number of similarities” with how fraudulent bank accounts had been opened at Wells itself.A high proportion — about 70 per cent — of the MyTerm policies sold through Wells in 2014 had lapsed, the suit added.About 15,000 of the Prudential policies have been sold through Wells since 2014, although that represents less than 1 per cent of the group’s US life premiums.Prudential said in a statement that the three former employees had been terminated for “entirely unrelated” reasons. An “ethics complaint” had been filed against them by other employees who were in “no way involved” with the Wells review.It said: “We are confident that the court will agree once the true facts are revealed during the litigation.”The company said it had surveyed Wells customers about their experience with MyTerm, and the results “did not indicate potential fraudulent sales activity”.“Following the revelations about Wells Fargo’s sales practices this fall, we expanded our review into how the product was sold. That review is ongoing.”Steve Pelletier, chief operating officer of Prudential’s US Businesses, added: “We stand behind the MyTerm product but have decided to suspend sales of that product through Wells Fargo’s retail banking franchise until we have all the facts about whether it is being distributed properly and in the best interest of customers.”Wells said: “We are deeply concerned about these allegations as they are completely counter to our values and our commitment to providing customers only the products and services they need and want.“We are working with Prudential to investigate any unauthorised or inappropriate referrals that may have occurred and we are suspending sales and referrals of the MyTerm product until the investigation is concluded.”

19;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-10-30T15:34:04Z;Big three US insurers set for earnings recovery;Low interest rates remain challenge for AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial;All three of the biggest US insurers, AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial, are poised to post improved earnings for the first time in five quarters, giving some relief to a sector hurt by persistently low interest ratesThe numbers provide some evidence that the industry can improve returns despite the Federal Reserve’s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has reduced the income insurers can produce from their vast bond-dominated investment portfolios.Insurance earnings season gets into full swing this week after a relatively upbeat batch of results from US banks.The three largest US insurers, which control a combined $2.2tn in assets, are all due to post rises in adjusted earnings per share, according to forecasts collated by Bloomberg.Analysts point to better returns from hedge funds. Weak returns from alternative investments have weighed on results from all three companies in recent quarters.Stronger stock markets, which bolster fees for insurers’ asset management operations, and efforts to trim expenses are also expected to improve the sector’s profits.Big challenges remain, however. Shares in AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial have rallied since the summer but they all trade at less than 70 per cent of the companies’ prospective book values — a sign of investor pessimism.“The earnings set up this quarter is pretty good but these aren’t secular trends,” cautioned Randy Binner, at Virginia-based FBR Capital Markets. “The companies are benefiting from improvements in alternative investments but the year-on-year comparisons also reflect one-off items.”Another risk for the sector are annual reviews that insurers make to their financial assumptions.Ryan Krueger, at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said several insurers, including Lincoln National and Voya, conducted actuarial reviews in the third quarter.The biggest forecast profits rise is for AIG. Peter Hancock, chief executive, is remodelling the company after he faced demands this year from activists Carl Icahn and John Paulson to consider a break-up of AIG’s life and non-life businesses.Since the crisis, AIG has slimmed radically, jettisoning businesses from aircraft leasing to consumer finance, and in recent months it has sold both its mortgage insurance arm and a Lloyd’s of London franchise.The biggest US insurer by market capitalisation, which has brushed aside the calls for a split, is expected on Wednesday to unveil that quarterly adjusted earnings per share have more than doubled on last year, according to the Bloomberg data.AIG’s earnings a year ago were hit by restructuring charges and a negative performance from alternative investments.Mr Binner added that AIG’s results this time would also benefit from a low level of losses across the property and casualty insurance industry.MetLife, which in the summer set out plans to cut costs by more than a tenth in the face of low interest rates, is forecast to post a year-on-year rise in adjusted EPS of 82 per cent in the third quarter.The anticipated improvement at Prudential Financial, which is focused on life insurance and asset management, is a more modest 4 per cent.
20;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-09-02T13:11:35Z;Payrolls reactions: ‘Not disastrous, but…’;;August’s jobs report has pre-occupied investors ever since policymakers at the Federal Reserve started striking a more hawkish tone in recent weeks.But Friday’s report showed that the US economy created fewer than last month, while July’s reading was upwardly revised to show now that it added 275,000 jobs that month.fastFT rounds up what economists think this means for the Fed as they meet in about three weeks.Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said a December move looks more likely:This should cool speculation about a September hike. The signal from last week’s Jackson Hole meeting was that investors should expect a rate hike sooner than they had been expecting. This report is certainly not disastrous but it’s probably not enough to convince the doves around Yellen that the Fed needs to raise rates just yet. December is once again shaping up to be the mostly likely date of the next hike.Quincy Krosby, Market Strategist at Prudential Financial, said the jobs number was solid but not enough to force the Fed’s hand this month.With equity futures rising, the dollar weakening, gold strengthening, and the ten year yield pulling back, the market has voted and says a September rate hike is off the tableWhile the report is solid and could be subject to a positive revision, it falls short of providing a resounding vote for a September move by the Fed.Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the wage number is better than it appears and that its the unemployment rate the Fed has its eye on. He said (emphasis ours):The key point here is that the unemployment rate is now unchanged, net, since January. That doesn’t mean it has finally levelled off, but it does mean that the rate of decline has slowed substantially.Given that the unemployment rate is at the heart of the Fed’s view on inflation, this means policymakers will feel they have a bit more room for maneuver. We expect no rate hike this month, but things will be different by December.Wage growth will have rebounded, and we expect payrolls to be rising more quickly too. But only three more employment reports will be released before the Dec FOMC meeting, so there’s little scope for further downside surprises if the Fed is going to act this year.Peter Tchir at Brean Capital said that after talks of weak data in August, the latest jobs print doesn’t seem that bad. He said:My understanding is the survey week did not include the 15th, helping explain a slightly weaker hourly earnings.Probably keeps Sept off the table, but not a horrible number and if Mester’s view is correct, then the Fed will view this more strongly than the market.Compiled by Mamta Badkar.
21;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-08-14T16:36:59Z;Insurers elicit fury over increases in elderly care premiums;Customers accuse companies of ‘obscene’ price rise demands for elderly;US insurance executives have been accused of making “obscene” demands to suddenly double care policy premiums for the elderly in clashes that highlight growing tensions over who pays for ageing societies.Angry customers of MetLife, the biggest US insurer by assets, and Unum, another provider, who have paid into long-term care policies for years complain they would be forced to stump up thousands of additional dollars or be left with inferior care in old age.Audrey Kennedy, who expects to begin claiming on a MetLife policy for her husband, who has Alzheimer’s, faces a rise in her annual premium from $8,000 to $16,000 a year.“[The threatened 95 per cent rise] is just unconscionable,” she said at a hearing last Friday in Florida, where the latest premium increases are set to apply pending approval by the state’s regulator.Insurers argue the increases are necessary as people live longer, causing claims costs to soar. Ultra-low interest rates have tightened the squeeze by eroding investment returns.Many companies, including Prudential Financial, AIG and Allianz, have been pushing through premium rises for the insurance, which pays out if policyholders become incapacitated through conditions such as dementia and need professional care.About $8.15bn in claims were paid out to 260,000 individuals last year, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Much of the industry has stopped selling new policies. Insurers are allowed to increase premiums for existing customers if they secure approval from regulators in each state.In Florida, thousands of customers could be hit by premium increases by MetLife, which is seeking rises of as much as 95 per cent, and Unum, which wants to push up premiums as much as 114 per cent. Elsewhere, federal government workers and pensioners are also facing big increases through an employer insurance scheme.Regulators typically grant insurers permission to increase premiums by significantly less than the companies have requested. Nevertheless, the hearings highlighted policyholders’ anxiety around the large increases.If we cannot force the Federal Reserve to increase the returns that we receive on our investments, insurance companies should not be able to increase our premiums to make up for the return that they did not receiveSeveral policyholders complained sales agents had failed to warn them properly about the threat of increased premiums — and that they had been left to pay the price for big miscalculations made by the companies.Jose Aragon, a resident of Coral Gables, said the “extreme increase” proposed by Unum was “simply unaffordable”.“If we cannot force the Federal Reserve to increase the returns that we receive on our investments, insurance companies should not be able to increase our premiums to make up for the return that they did not receive.”Noel Weinstock, who has paid $30,000 into a MetLife policy, said it was an “obscenity” for the insurer to call for such large rises after it paid out $1.7bn worth of dividends to shareholders last year.But defenders of the industry argue the policies still provide a good deal, and the stability of the insurance sector could be undermined if it was required to meet the obligations in full without increasing premiums.$8.15bnAmount in claims paid out to 260,000 individuals last yearGeorge Braddock, a long-term insurance sales specialist based in Florida, said customers had been forewarned prices could rise. He added that nearly all the companies operating when he began his career in 2000 were no longer selling new policies. “We need them to stay in the business.”MetLife and Unum acknowledged the impact of the premium increases on customers. But Jonathan Trend, actuary at MetLife, said the “increases are needed because the experience relating to these policies has been, and is expected to remain, materially worse than initially anticipated.”Steve Zabel, an executive at Unum who manages the insurer’s historic policies, said: “Long-term care losses have had and will continue to have significant adverse impacts on our company.”

By the close on Monday, its share price was within 4 per cent of the lows it touched during the markets meltdown in February.Prudential Financial, which makes about half of its profits in Japan, was off 13 per cent, while Lincoln National was down 20 per cent after a second consecutive day of heavy selling.John Heagarty, insurance analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the sell-off in the sector had been driven largely by concerns about lower-for-longer interest rates. “The likelihood now of a rate rise this year has plummeted.”Randy Binner at FBR Capital Markets said insurers might need to add to their reserves, hitting profits. “The risk of that has increased,” he said.“Everything will be fine from a policyholders perspective . . . [but] the companies have to set aside more money to pay claims.”Also hard hit have been electronic brokerages including Charles Schwab and E*Trade Financial, whose shares are down 19 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.Such companies earn profits from lending to clients to make investments, and lower interest rates cut into the margin between lending and borrowing costs. Brokers also generate income on securities purchased with client cash balances.E*Trade has 60 per cent of its revenues tied to the interest margin, according to Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo. “We expect Brexit to keep the Fed on hold for a long while,” he wrote in a note to clients.More investors now believe that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates this year. Before last Thursday’s referendum, financial markets showed a greater than 50 per cent chance of a rate increase in 2016, but in early trading this week, the probability had fallen below 10 per cent.

Bank of America dropped 6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase 4.7 per cent and Goldman Sachs 5.7 per cent, reports Alistair Gray in New York.Big US investment banks use London as a base from which to access the European single market, which is now threatened by Brexit.Yet also hit was the US-focused Wells Fargo, which has only a very small business in the UK. Its shares were down 4.1 per cent, in a sign markets are concerned about the wider fall-out of Brexit on the US economy.US insurers were also caught up in the markets rout. MetLife and Prudential Financial fell 8.5 per cent and 7.1 per cent respectively. American International Group, which has a sizeable operation in London, was down 4.9 per cent.Financials sharply underperformed the S&P 500 index, which was down 2.6 per cent soon after the open.As well as higher expenses arising from potential relocation out of London, analysts have the cautioned US financial institutions will need to deal with foreign exchange volatility and uncertainty putting clients off trading and dealmaking.
24;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-06-03T22:14:07Z;Fed plots two-tier regime for insurer capital rules;;The US Federal Reserve has made a tentative step toward imposing tougher capital requirements on insurers, inviting comment on a proposal for a two-tier regime designed to shield the financial system from another Lehman-like shock.Under the proposal, endorsed by the Fed’s board on Friday afternoon, American International Group and Prudential Financial, the huge insurance conglomerate, would face more stringent rules, while the dozen insurance firms under supervision by the Fed due to their banking activities – the likes of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance and Nationwide Mutual Insurance – would be subject to lighter capital requirements linked to existing state-based standards, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.Governor Daniel Tarullo had previewed the twin-track regime during a speech two weeks ago. The proposals will now go through at least two rounds of public comment before being finalised.The proposal is the product of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which gave the Fed regulatory responsibilities both for insurance holding companies that own a federally insured bank, and for insurance companies designated as a “systemically important financial institution” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Since that law was passed, the industry and its state regulators have been urging the Fed to craft rules reflecting difference between the operations of insurance companies and the banks the Fed usually regulates.“I believe this proposal is an important step toward capital standards that are both appropriate for our supervised insurance firms and that enhance the resiliency and stability of our financial system,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said.MetLife, the largest US life insurer by assets, had been categorized as a SIFI, but a federal judge struck down that designation in March. The US government has appealed.AIG declined to comment.A Prudential spokesperson said the firm was “pleased to see the progress the Federal Reserve is making in designing capital, liquidity and supervisory standards tailored to insurance companies, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide input into the framework.“While there is still considerable work ahead and the details will be important, we view this as a positive step forward that recognizes the underlying economics of our businesses.”
25;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-05-26T10:52:24Z;Prudential Financial at risk of missing profits target;Low interest rates squeeze returns that insurance groups earn on investment portfolios;Prudential Financial is in danger of missing its annual profits goal for the first time since the financial crisis in the latest sign of mounting challenges in the US life insurance industry.Ultra low interest rates are squeezing insurers and the income they can generate from their multibillion-dollar investment portfolios, which are dominated by bonds.Recent market volatility has also caused several companies, including Prudential Financial, to take a hit from alternative investments, notably hedge funds.Before Christmas Robert Falzon, chief financial officer, issued guidance of adjusted operating income for 2016 of between $9.75 and $10.25 a share.But analysts have been lowering their forecasts for Prudential Financial, whose first-quarter earnings of $2.18 a share fell short of forecasts of $2.36. The latest consensus estimates collated by Bloomberg point to full-year earnings of $9.53 a share, a decline of about 5 per cent from 2015.That would be the first time since 2008 that the insurer’s earnings have fallen short of the guidance it provided.Mark Grier, vice-chairman, declined to comment directly on whether 2016 earnings would meet guidance. But he told the Financial Times that the second-largest US insurer by assets had no plans to shake up its investment portfolio.He also said the company had scope to adjust how it priced policies, saying guaranteed returns it had offered consumers were mostly “very low”.“We’re not overreacting,” he said. “Our fundamentals are very strong.”Prudential Financial has a market capitalisation of about $35bn and 49,000 employees and sales associates. Based in New Jersey, it makes about half its profits in Japan.Mr Grier noted that the company had made various assumptions in its guidance, including where the 10-year Treasury rate finishes 2016.“If the assumptions turn out to be wrong we will see variances in earnings,” he said. “The substance of our business remains very strong.”Several of Prudential Financial’s peers are cutting out hedge funds as they grow dissatisfied with poor performance.MetLife, which has about $1.8bn invested in the asset class, disclosed plans this month to reduce its exposure by about two-thirds over the next two years. AIG is planning to cut its $10bn exposure by about half over a similar timeframe.In the first quarter, Prudential Financial’s so-called non-coupon investment returns — a category that includes private equity, property and some listed stocks, as well as hedge funds — fell about $90m short of its average expectations.Nevertheless Mr Grier said: “We have a very well run alternatives capability . . . There were aspects of the first quarter that were very unusual”.Total net investment income in the first quarter was broadly the same as a year ago, at about $3bn.“We’re not getting particularly squeezed as rates come down,” said Mr Grier, who joined as chief financial officer in 1995. “We emphasise pricing and product design.”Regulators have deemed Prudential Financial, along with AIG and MetLife, a “systemically important” institution whose failure could wreak havoc on the financial system.MetLife took on the authorities in court, challenging the designation. This year MetLife secured a legal victory, allowing it to shed the Sifi label. The government plans to appeal.Prudential Financial has avoided a legal challenge. Even so, Mr Grier said: “The fact that you haven’t taken it to court doesn’t mean you’ve not contested it.”“We come up for annual redesignation,” he added. “We will be submitting documents as part of that process, to present our view. There are new facts as a result of the MetLife case.”
26;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-04-08T10:14:48Z;Insurers warned of downgrade risk from US retirement shake-up;S&P cautions new ‘fiduciary’ standard will hit sales of some principal products;US insurers have been put on notice over how the Obama administration’s shake-up of pensions advice will hurt their businesses after a leading credit agency warned the reforms could put their ratings at risk.Standard & Poor’s cautioned in a report that a new “fiduciary” retirement standard published this week would hit sales of some of life insurance companies’ principal products.The sweeping changes demand that financial professionals act in the best interests of retirement savers — toughening existing rules, which require only that they make “suitable” recommendations.S&P’s assessment underscores how the reforms could still reshape the US retail financial services landscape, even though the industry secured important concessions from regulators.The final version of the rules are not as strict as those regulators originally proposed. Nevertheless, industry lobbyists heavily criticised them — raising the prospect that they will launch a lawsuit to challenge the reforms.“Unless we see fundamental changes, this rule will remain unworkable,” said David Hirschmann, who runs the US Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.He added: “We will consider every approach to address our concerns.”Insurers are expected to be hit because the changes will apply to so-called variable annuities and fixed-indexed annuities — popular retirement products that generated about $190bn in revenues last year.“This could meaningfully affect sales of VAs and FIAs in the near term,” said Beth Campbell, an S&P credit analyst, of the new regime, which begins next April.S&P said it did not envision changing insurers’ credit ratings “at this time”. But the agency added it anticipated “potential rating implications in the next couple of years, depending on how life insurers adapt”.US-listed insurers AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial are big sellers of such products, according to data from the trade body Limra.Their European rivals are also likely to be affected. American divisions of the UK’s Prudential, France’s Axa and Germany’s Allianz rank among the 10 largest US annuity writers.S&P added: “If insurers selling VAs and FIAs are unable to adapt to higher compliance costs and potential litigation liability, resulting in weaker profit margins, their credit quality could suffer.”Even so, several of the companies have said that even a particularly adverse scenario would be manageable and could also provide an opportunity to take market share from rivals.Fitch, another big rating agency, highlighted the rules were “less onerous than expected” — although it was cautious about the implications for companies that sell fixed indexed annuities.FIAs were one area in which officials toughened the rules since they published a draft last year. Shares in American Equity Investment Life — the fourth-largest seller of fixed indexed annuities according to Limra — dropped 15 per cent after the changes were unveiled.“Many of the negative aspects of the new regulations will have a greater impact on them,” Fitch said of FIAs, although it added that “over the longer term, both FIA and VA writers will be able to adapt”.The regulatory overhaul in the US comes at a delicate time for the global life insurance sector.Rock-bottom interest rates have pushed up the value of the companies’ liabilities and made it harder for them to generate adequate returns on their investment portfolios.
27;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-03-31T11:50:19Z;GE looks to shed ‘too big to fail’ status;;General Electric said on Thursday that it has asked US regulators to drop its “too big to fail” status, capping the transformation that chief executive Jeffrey Immelt laid out last year when he unveiled sweeping plans to divest its US financial operations.The company said it has filed an application with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for the recisssion for GE Capital’s designation as a “systemically important” financial institution (Sifi).GE Capital Chairman and CEO Keith Sherin said:We believe GE Capital no longer meets the criteria to be designated as a SIFI and we look forward to working cooperatively and constructively with the FSOC through the rescission process.The move, which was a main driver in Mr Immelt’s decision last year to sell-off the bulk of its financial and lending operations, comes just a day after insurer MetLife secured a victory in its battle against US regulators that deemed it a Sifi.The ruling may have far-reaching implications for the country’s financial system and could encourage legal challenges from the other insurers considered to be Sifis — American International Group and Prudential Financial.For GE, shedding the Sifi label would free up billions of dollars in capital and allow Mr Immelt to refocus on its industrial business.Shares in GE, up 28 per cent over the past year, were largely unchanged in pre-market trading.
28;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-03-30T16:43:37Z;MetLife wins ‘too big to fail’ court battle;Insurer defeats US government’s ‘systemically important’ financial institution designation;MetLife has secured a victory in its battle against US regulators that deemed it ‘too big to fail’, a legal ruling that may have far-reaching implications for the country’s financial system.In a blow to the Obama administration, a court in Washington on Wednesday found it had acted unlawfully by deciding the insurance group deserved tougher regulation as a “systemically important” financial institution (Sifi). The government can appeal.The ruling will shake an important pillar of the Dodd-Frank legislative reforms drawn up after the financial crisis and could encourage legal challenges from the other insurers deemed to be Sifis — American International Group and Prudential Financial.The banks already classed as systemically important have less chance of escaping via the courts because the criteria for their designation — unlike that of non-banks — is written directly into the law.Members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) had voted nine to one in favour of designating MetLife a Sifi, a label that leads to additional regulatory scrutiny and higher capital requirements.FSOC’s members include Janet Yellen, Fed chair, and Jack Lew, treasury secretary.A Treasury spokesman said: “We strongly disagree with the court’s decision. We are confident that FSOC’s determination was lawful and will continue to defend the council’s designations process vigorously.”But the district court found FSOC had acted unlawfully, giving MetLife an amnesty.The decision pushed up shares in MetLife — the largest US insurer by assets — 5.2 per cent on Wednesday. It is an important breakthrough for Steven Kandarian, the MetLife chief executive who took on the authorities a year ago.“Today’s ruling validates MetLife’s decision to seek judicial review,” he said in a statement. “From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.”Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin and a lawyer who represented MetLife in court, had argued the process that led to MetLife being deemed a Sifi was a “black box”.MetLife challenged the decision even though the consequences of designation were unclear. The regime has yet to take effect, with regulators yet to quantify the additional capital requirements.Today’s ruling validates MetLife’s decision to seek judicial review. From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United StatesGovernment lawyers had come under tough questioning from Rosemary Collyer, the district judge in Washington, earlier this year as they sought to defend their deliberations.The full legal judgment was not immediately available.Despite the ruling in its favour, MetLife is expected to press ahead with plans to sell off a big slice of its business — for which part of the rationale was to reduce the burden from being designated a Sifi.People familiar with the matter acknowledged the government’s scope to appeal could drag the process on for months or years. They also pointed out that there were other business reasons for a split.Weston Bloomer, analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said most investors had expected the government to win the case. “The final ruling is still up in the air, but this is a clear positive and gives them [MetLife] a fighting chance.”Steve Myrow, a former US Treasury official now at Beacon Policy Advisors, said: “It’s more of a political black eye for the Obama administration than anything else. It will play into the broader theme of the administration overstepping its executive authority.”MetLife is planning to float or sell part of its retail division in a deal expected to be worth about $10bn.AIG has come under pressure from activist investors to split into smaller companies in large part because of its Sifi designation.
29;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2016-03-02T16:43:50Z;US life insurers shaken by rock-bottom rates;Industry titans hit almost as hard as banks amid macroeconomic concerns;Life insurers are supposed to be bedrocks of financial stability, dependable institutions whose long-term business models set them apart from scandal-hit banks.Yet shares in the leading US insurers, which help millions of Americans through retirement, have been anything but stable in recent weeks. Titans of the industry have been hit almost as hard as lenders in this year’s stock market rout.Shares in Lincoln National, the third largest listed US life insurer by assets, have dropped 23 per cent — more than any S&P 500 bank. The two biggest, MetLife and Prudential Financial, have lost more than 13 per cent even after a partial recovery this week.Many of the macroeconomic woes that have led investors to sell bank stocks have also made them nervous about life insurers.The biggest worry is rock-bottom interest rates, which push up the value of the insurers’ liabilities and make it a struggle for them to generate adequate returns on their vast investment portfolios.Stock market volatility, energy sector fragility and regulatory uncertainty have added to the pressure.For seasoned insurance analysts it is little wonder the sector has been battered. Life insurers’ valuations track closely 10-year bond yields, which have been at or near record lows for years.“You can usually tell how the industry is going to trade based on what the 10-year is doing,” says Steven Schwartz an analyst at Raymond James.This week Japan became the second country to sell such bonds at a negative yield, following Switzerland. Yet yields do not need to be sub zero to cause big problems for insurers. Ultra low is bad enough.Insurers traditionally invest the cash they get from policyholders largely in corporate and government bonds. Too much allocated to racier asset classes, such as equities, would threaten their ability to pay claims.However, the era of depressed bond yields has made the sector’s conservative approach to investments increasingly perilous.Life insurers are constrained in how much pain they can pass on to customers. They have sold savings and retirement policies that offer consumers minimum returns — and need to meet promises made years ago when interest rates were higher.Products with guarantees account for between 60 and 80 per cent of US life insurers’ balance sheets, Moody’s estimates. The average outstanding guarantee is between 2 and 4 per cent.The companies seek to match their liabilities by investing in long-term assets. But the match is often far from perfect.“There are some products where it’s almost impossible to find investments that go out as far as the cash flow on the policies,” says Scott Robinson at Moody’s. Liabilities associated with long-term care insurance stretch out for decades, for instance.Rating agencies are concerned insurers are being tempted to turn to riskier asset classes to deal with the problem. Fitch says it “remains concerned about the strategies that life insurers may use to reach for additional yield.”Downgrades of energy bonds caused by the oil price fall are another concern. As of the start of the year 13 of the largest US life insurers held $67.2bn of energy assets, according to Morgan Stanley. Energy accounts for about 7 per cent of the typical insurer’s investment portfolio.It is not only fixed-income markets that are causing a headache. Turbulence in equities is also bad news for the sector.Lower stock prices mean lower fees for insurers’ asset management arms.Stock market downturns also make variable annuities (VAs) — popular retirement-income products in the US — harder to manage.VAs are backed by equities, which can give consumers stock market-like returns. But they also offer lifetime guarantees, protecting policyholders against heavy losses.To meet the guarantees the insurers attempt to hedge their exposures. But they have had mixed success in doing so. “Does the hedging work? There’s always concern about that,” says Mr Schwartz of Raymond James.VAs are forecast to generate an average 14 per cent of earnings this year at seven US life insurers tracked by Morgan Stanley. Some companies have far greater exposure. They are set to account for almost half of Lincoln Financial’s 2016 profits — helping explain why its shares have been hit particularly hard.On top of unfavourable financial markets, the industry is also facing regulatory challenges.VAs, which tend to be sold through financial advisers, are expected to be hit by proposals from the US Labor Department to tighten standards for distributors.The rule would require brokers and advisers to act as “fiduciaries” — putting their consumers’ interests first.The change could put financial middlemen at greater risk of legal challenges for alleged mis-selling — and reduce incentives for them to sell complex products such as VAs in the first place.Dennis Glass, Lincoln’s chief executive, moved to reassure Wall Street on a recent call with analysts. Even the most “adverse scenario” would be “manageable”, he said. Only 30 per cent of the company’s annuity sales in the fourth quarter came from products it expected to be impacted by the Labor Department’s crackdown.Meanwhile, Prudential, MetLife and AIG are also facing higher capital requirements after officials deemed them “ systemically important” financial institutions.Supervisors have yet to quantify the consequences of designation, but that has not stopped MetLife from setting out plans to break itself up to soften the anticipated regulatory blow.Despite the pressures, few analysts are worried about the sector’s financial strength. The industry-wide “risk-based capital” ratio — which compares the amount of capital with the minimum required — had improved from 413 per cent in 2009 to 491 per cent at the end of last year, according to Morgan Stanley.The businesses are still throwing off plenty of cash, helping them return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Prudential Financial has paid out $9bn since the start of 2011. In December it raised its dividend by a fifth. MetLife increased its dividend 7 per cent last year. In total the insurer distributed $3.5bn to shareholders in 2015.The three largest life insurers by assets are trading at discounts of about 30 per cent of their respective book values. Many analysts argue this presents a big buying opportunity.“The industry is very well capitalised,” says Mr Schwartz, adding of the sell-off: “It’s way, way, way over done.”European life insurers have had just as tough a start to 2016 as their US counterparts. Share prices of the largest companies are down heavily, writes Oliver Ralph in London.Allianz, Aviva, Legal & General and Prudential are all down between 10 and 15 per cent in the year to date. The Southern Europeans have had it worse — Italy’s Generali and Unipol, and Spain’s Mapfre, are all down by more than a fifth.Like the US life insurers, the Europeans have had to cope with low interest rates and, since January, volatile capital markets. Low interest rates are especially painful because in some markets — notably Germany — the insurers have sold products that guarantee investment returns well above what is available in the market today.The Europeans have also had to deal with the added complication of the EU’s Solvency II rules, which were introduced at the start of January and force them to make tough decisions about the assets they hold.“Under Solvency II, the insurers need to optimise their assets for risk, return and capital consumption,” says Patrick Liedtke, a managing director in BlackRock’s insurance asset management team. “That’s not an easy equation to solve.”For some insurers, Solvency II has meant a move into government debt. “If your solvency capital level is not where you’d like it to be, then it is the asset class of choice,” says Mr Liedtke.But wherever possible, the insurers are looking for higher yields. “They are getting as much exposure to government debt as they need, then trying to use the risk budget to get more exposure to higher yields,” he adds. That is leading many of them into corporate bonds and infrastructure debt, where demand often exceeds supply.Solvency II has also forced the insurers to be more open about how fluctuating markets affect their capital. For example, when it reported its results last week, French insurer Axa said that its Solvency Capital Ratio (available capital as a percentage of the minimum required) was 205 per cent at the end of December, but that market movements had since pushed it down to about 190 per cent.

The decision to postpone the implementation of the sprawling legislation, known as Mifid II, is a blow to the EU. The commission promised that the reforms would strengthen investor protection and improve the transparency and efficiency of Europe’s financial markets. Market participants have struggled to deal with the highly complex proposals but the European Commission remains adamant that the delay will not lead to any dilution of the reforms.● Goodbye Pramerica, hello PGIM. The asset management arm of Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, has ditched the clunky pseudonym Pramerica that it was forced to use outside of North America in favour of a new global brand: PGIM. Executives grew frustrated with explaining the Pramerica title to prospective clients in Europe and Asia where the entirely separate UK insurer Prudential holds the rights to the Pru name.● Big outflows from M&G, the UK asset manager, overshadowed results from its parent, Prudential, the UK insurer. Retail investors pulled almost £4bn of funds from M&G during the third quarter, bringing outflows from these clients to £7.3bn so far this year.● Two high-profile London hedge fund managers have declared their support for the campaign to keep Britain in the EU. David Harding, the founder of $30bn Winton Capital Management, is understood to be donating several million pounds to the campaign, while John Armitage, founder of Egerton Capital, the $15bn hedge fund, is giving a six-figure sum. Mr Harding, who provided the largest ever donation to the Science Museum in London, said some hedge fund managers “had cried wolf a bit” about the impact of European regulation on their business.● Amundi’s stock market flotation on Thursday, the largest initial public offering in Paris for a decade, went smoothly. The asset manager’s share price ended its first day of trading up 3.6 per cent, at €46.60, after the global offering price was set at €45, towards the bottom of the indicative range (€42 to €52.50). The flotation, which was supported by 15 banks, raised €1.5bn for Société Générale, which sold its entire 20 per cent stake.● Cerberus, the US private equity manager, has bought a £13bn portfolio of mortgages issued by Northern Rock, the UK lender that collapsed in 2007, from UK Asset Resolution, the “bad bank” charged with disposing taxpayer-owned assets.
32;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2015-11-10T14:32:08Z;Prudential Investment Management changes name to drum up business;Asset management arm tired of explaining ‘Pramerica’ to clients;When portfolio managers and salesmen from Prudential Investment Management, the asset management arm of US insurance group Prudential Financial, call on prospective clients in Europe or Asia, they tend to spend the first few minutes of the meeting apologising for the company name, executives say.The reason is that in large parts of the world, the company has to go by the clunky pseudonym Pramerica. Prudential Plc, the UK insurer, has the rights to the Prudential name in many countries outside the US.The frustration has boiled over at Prudential Financial’s headquarters in Newark, New Jersey and, as of January, the Pramerica name is going to be replaced with a new global brand: PGIM.“We have been building out more in Southeast Asia, in India, Malaysia and other places where the America part of that wasn’t necessarily something that people wanted to meet with,” says David Hunt, Prudential Investment Management’s chief executive.“It’s a brand that I think never got a lot of support, and I’m not sure that it best represented our investment capabilities even in its best days, so that will largely be subsumed by the PGIM name.”Prudential is following in the footsteps of Goldman Sachs and Old Mutual, other financial groups that have concocted connotation-free acronyms for their asset management arms in GSAM and OMAM, respectively.The company has also put $350m as seed capital into new funds — more than $100m more than usual — and expects to do the same amount next year. Alongside the new branding, on Tuesday it announced it was building out its cross-border funds business with a London-based Ucits platform that will be called PGIM Funds.Some of the Prudential affiliates, such as its Jennison equities business, will keep their historic names, but most will take the PGIM title. The rebrand does not extend to the company logo, which will continue to be a stylised version of the Rock of Gibraltar, a symbol its founder, John Dryden, began using in the 1880s to signify strength and solidity.For Mr Hunt, a former partner at McKinsey, who joined Prudential in 2011, the rebrand is the next step in the global expansion of the asset management business. The number of non-US clients has jumped from 15 per cent three years ago to 25 per cent today. Its fixed income business, which accounts for more than half of its assets under management, has been a beneficiary of the management turmoil at rival Pimco, which has shed assets around the globe in the past 18 months.It’s a brand that I think never got a lot of support, and I’m not sure that it best represented our investment capabilities even in its best daysIn all, Prudential manages $947bn, some $570bn of it for external clients and the remainder for its insurance company. Because of the size of that insurance arm, US and global regulators have designated the holding company as a systemically important financial institution (Sifi), triggering extra oversight from the Federal Reserve.While corporate headquarters complained vigorously about the Sifi designation, Mr Hunt says it has had some unexpected benefits, at least in the asset management arm.“Clients are rather liking it,” he said. “It is not a bad thing to know that somebody else has been through and kicked the tyres and feels that you really do have a risk management system, that your model risks have all been tested and that you have been through the cyber security hoops the Fed wants you to go through.”Asset managers that are not part of an insurance or banking group appear to have avoided Sifi designation for now, but regulators are looking at ways in which the industry might contribute to a future financial crisis. One area of concern is a run on mutual funds, which allow investors to pull their money out any day.Mr Hunt agrees that the industry came through a kind of stress test when Bill Gross, Pimco’s founder, walked out of that company in September last year, triggering outflows that halved the size of its flagship Total Return Bond fund, at that time the biggest bond fund in the world. Prudential saw no market disruption, and Mr Hunt is pleased that Pimco appears to have staunched the bleeding.“Every major asset manager would probably be regulated if the mutual fund structure had gone down,” he said. “It’s not good for any of us when a big player stumbles in a way that gets at the heart of the trust in the industry. I think financial services need to re-establish trust. We don’t need to have stuff go off the rails, so I think we were very pleased actually to see that things began to stabilise.”

34;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Big insurers face tough new safety rules;Companies team up to fight extra capital demands that seek to avoid repeat of rescued AIG;Regulators seeking to prevent a repeat of the failure of AIG in 2008 are planning to hit nine of the world’s biggest insurers with safety rules that are tougher than some in the industry had expected. Prudential of the UK, Germany’s Allianz and New York-based MetLife are among the companies that face being hurt by the proposals, which are estimated to increase the amount of capital they must hold as a cushion against unexpected losses by 10 per cent on average.The new regime for global “systemically important” insurers, overseen by the G20's Financial Stability Board, is the latest sign that a wide range of institutions are coming up against tighter supervision — seven years on from the global financial crisis.Insurers have attacked the plans, which have been signed off by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor who also chairs the FSB. They argue AIG — rescued by the US government in September 2008 — did not run into trouble because of its traditional insurance operations and complain they are being wrongly lumped together with banks.In a joint submission to regulators, eight of the nine insurers set to be affected — including Axa of France, Aviva of the UK and Generali of Italy — say the capital add-on is a “blunt tool” that is set “too high and unlikely to contribute to financial stability”.A paper to be published on Monday quantifies the higher capital requirements for the designated insurers, which also include China's Ping An and Prudential Financial of the US, as well as AIG.The size of the hit will depend on each company’s mix of business and how systemically important regulators deem them to be. So-called non-traditional and non-insurance (NTNI) activities carry the largest surcharges, of between 12 per cent and 25 per cent.Insurers and watchdogs are fighting over what constitutes NTNI. Regulators have signalled that operations including types of variable annuities — an important product in the US — and trade credit insurance will be included, although the list has yet to be finalised.To the further irritation of the industry, traditional insurance will also be subject to higher capital requirements for the nine institutions — with typical top up charges of between 6 per cent and 9 per cent.Insurers in Europe are already braced for a looming overhaul of capital requirements under the EU's Solvency II regime. The UK’s Prudential has repeatedly threatened to uproot its headquarters from London because of Solvency II, which begins in January.The global rules for the big nine insurers come into force in 2019.Felix Hufeld, who chairs the executive committee of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, said: “The IAIS has met a major milestone in its commitment to address risks to the global financial system from systemically important insurers.”The IAIS said it would review the regime every year. It plans to launch a consultation on the definitions of non-traditional and non-insurance — as well as the criteria that determine which insurers are deemed “systemically important” — next month.
35;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2015-04-28T18:04:11Z;Republicans attack new global insurance rules;Richard Shelby says international regime should not dictate how US companies are supervised;Global insurance rules face a revolt in the US as Republicans spearhead complaints that international regulators who they say lack accountability are imposing inappropriate standards on American companies.The financial crisis and the government rescue of US insurer AIG prompted a new regulatory regime for insurance, but the Republican takeover of Congress has brought to the surface deep unease over their development in the US.While the discontent in Washington is not universal, it signals trouble for the Financial Stability Board, a group of regulators and central bankers set up by the Group of 20 leading economies in 2009 to fortify the global financial system.At the head of the Republican attacks is Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate banking committee, who used a hearing on Tuesday to showcase a range of concerns about the FSB’s influence.“An international regulatory regime should not dictate how US regulators supervise American or US-based companies,” he said in comments consistent with longstanding Republican scepticism towards a variety of international forums.He lamented that decisions made by the FSB — which is based in Basel, Switzerland — had been adopted “with what appears to be little independent evaluation” by the US’s umbrella group of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council.The FSB decided that three US insurers — AIG, Prudential Financial and MetLife — are so critical to the financial system that they must be subject to tighter global regulation and potentially higher capital requirements. The FSOC has also designated the three as “ systemically important”.“The FSB is not a US regulator, and it is not accountable to Congress or the American people,” Mr Shelby said. “Therefore, the FSOC should not merely be a rubber stamp for the decisions made by an unaccountable international body like the FSB.”The FSB has no powers to enforce recommendations and instead relies on soft diplomacy of its members to ensure that its proposals are implemented by each country. The FSB declined to comment.An international regulatory regime should not dictate how US regulators supervise American or US-based companiesSix years after the crisis’s nadir, Mr Shelby’s comments come amid a wider debate over whether the FSB should be a treaty-based organisation such as the World Bank or IMF, which can sanction countries that do not implement measures. The US has also not signed up to certain IMF standards.Despite Republican concerns, signs of US sway at the FSB emerged this month with the revelation that the Bank of England had written to the US Treasury to ask why the reinsurance business of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was left off its list of “too big to fail” institutions.Mr Shelby controls what legislation emerges from the banking committee for a full vote in the Senate and is preparing a comprehensive financial reform bill.On Monday two Senators — Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, and Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana — introduced a bill to “bring more accountability and transparency to the international insurance process”.We work with our international counterparts to build a global consensus that works for the United StatesThe FSB is due to promulgate capital requirements for insurers, which are being written by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and “resolution” standards for winding up insurers in the event of failure.Roy Woodall, an independent member of the FSOC and an insurance expert, told the committee that a “contorted international framework” was “why I think we should be cautious about ongoing initiatives”.He said: “There is still time to ensure that any international agreement consented to by the FSB is reached through a more open process that is in the best interests of the US.”Warren Buffett company left off provisional ‘too big to fail’ listContinue readingMr Shelby noted that Jack Lew, US Treasury secretary, had previously told the committee that FSB decisions did not bind the FSOC. Michael McRaith, a Treasury director, said on Tuesday that international standards are “not self-executing in the US”, because state and federal regulators study and test their impact before any implementation.“We work with our international counterparts to build a global consensus that works for the United States,” he said.David Green, the former head of international policy at the UK’s financial watchdog, said Mr Shelby’s comments were consistent with the “long-held congressional tradition of sovereignty”.“It is a quite carefully worded statement that does not necessarily disagree with the substance of FSB decisions, just that they have not been independently evaluated to satisfy that they meet US requirements,” Mr Green said.
36;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2014-07-13T07:25:18Z;Prudential boss says investors should dig in for long term;Global solutions entail cutting across asset classes, regions and business line;In an earlier life, David Hunt might well have spent his days covered in coal dust.After emigrating from Scotland in the 19th century, his ancestors established several coal mines in Colorado that were owned by his family until recently.“I feel like I still have the mining heritage in my blood,” says Mr Hunt, who has dug out an entirely different career path.As the chief executive of Prudential Investment Management, the $891bn asset management arm of the US insurer Prudential, Mr Hunt oversees eight businesses that cover public and private fixed income, active, passive and quantitative equity strategies and a large real estate operation.The multi-manager model was developed in the late 1990s by John Strangfeld, now chairman and chief executive of the holding company Prudential Financial, to generate returns for the insurance business and outside investors.“Each feels like an investment partnership,” says Mr Hunt, adding “if you went to a meeting of Jennison Associates [fundamentally based active equity and fixed income] or PCG [private placements and mezzanine financing], you would feel part of a team run by the top ten people in a partnership”.He argues this model is a “powerful way to manage money” because the leaders of the eight businesses retain autonomy and accountability, helping to align the interests of employees and investors.Historically, Prudential Investment Management, which is also known as Pramerica in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, has preferred to let its businesses communicate individually.But Mr Hunt feels it is time for a change as clients are looking for global solutions that cut across asset classes, regions and Prudential’s business lines.“Increasingly we need to work across our units. That is leading us to talk more publicly about the capabilities of Prudential Investment Management, rather than leaving it to individual businesses,” says Mr Hunt.He clearly feels PIM’s success has been underplayed, pointing out it has enjoyed 26 consecutive quarters of positive inflows from third-party institutions.“People look at me slightly cross-eyed when I explain that Prudential is the tenth largest asset manager in the world,” he says.Although the Prudential insurance general account remains his biggest and most important client, the bulk of asset growth over the past 15 years has come from outside investors.“Around 22 per cent of our fees come from the general account and 78 per cent come from third party,” says the 53-year-old.He attributes this to the breadth of Prudential’s multi-manager capabilities and strong investment performance. “Look at the three-year track records and more than 80 per cent of our fixed income and equity assets, net of fees, exceed their benchmark. That’s an extremely strong figure. We are active managers and we are good at it.”Erik Bass, an analyst at Citi, says these “very solid” asset management operations have helped the broader Prudential group achieve higher returns than other insurers.Prudential’s $418bn fixed income division is its largest and fastest growing in recent years. With more pension funds in the US and UK looking to de-risk their investment portfolios after strong gains for equities, Prudential is benefiting as these clients move more money into fixed income.Prudential recently agreed a £16bn longevity swap with the £39.6bn BT pension fund, the largest UK deal of its kind. It already had the largest US deals to date, struck with General Motors in 2012 and Verizon in 2013. More of these “jumbo” pension risk transfers are anticipated by Mr Hunt.The $68bn Prudential Capital Group, which runs the largest US private placements business (a form of lending) along with mezzanine financing and infrastructure investing, has grown since the financial crisis as banks have pulled back from providing commercial mortgages and credit to companies.“In many cases, we were the only guy in the room willing to continue to lend money,” explains Mr Hunt.Activity has grown rapidly in the UK (where PCG is known as Pricoa Capital Group) as bank lending has been even slower to recover than in the US.“There was not enough capital being lent out in the UK,” he says, adding that competition from other providers has increased.Regulators are looking more critically at asset managers’ role in shadow banking as they move into areas previously dominated by banks. Mr Hunt insists that to describe the PCG business as shadow banking is inaccurate, pointing out that banks separated their loan underwriting and origination functions.“We don’t believe in that model at all,” he says, adding that most of PCG’s lending is done directly to companies with which it has a long-term relationship, instead of via an agent.“That has meant that our credit experience has been terrific, even through the financial crisis. The accountability that we have is very clear and it does not have any of the principal agent problems of the banking model,” he emphasises.Prudential Financial, the holding company, has been designated a systemically important financial institution by US regulators. Capital rules affecting Sifis are still being written so the impact on Prudential’s asset management operations remains unclear. But Mr Hunt says clients view Sifi designation as a further protection for the soundness of their investments.He cautions that the increasing difficulties of meeting regulatory requirements will reshape asset management as smaller players struggle to meet rising legal and compliance costs.With Prudential’s real estate business managing about $42bn, the question of whether bubbles are developing in property markets worldwide naturally concerns Mr Hunt.“Our real estate team believes fundamentals are strong but there are signs of imbalances developing in major cities. And I detect worryingly little conviction that these imbalances will get better as long as interest rates are held down through government intervention,” says Mr Hunt.He concludes with a plea for institutions and individuals to take a long-term view of investment plans, noting that holding periods have declined due to the expansion of high-frequency trading, leveraged hedge funds and the exchange traded funds industry.“It is important for people to have long-term, multiyear plans for their assets. The more pressures there are to adjust, day to day or week to week, the more likely people are to make poor decisions.”Sentiments that his Scots mining predecessors would surely applaud.——————————————-David HuntBorn 1961Education1984 BA, Engineering, Princeton University1988 MBA in Finance and multinational management from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton SchoolCareer1994 Elected partner at McKinsey & Company in London2001-11 Senior partner and co-leader of North American asset management practice, McKinsey & Company2011 to present President and chief executive of Prudential (Pramerica) Investment ManagementOther positionsBoard of directors of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

37;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2014-07-04T10:19:24Z;BT pension fund strikes deal to hedge longevity risk;;BT’s pension scheme has moved to hedge the financial risk of paying out more to pensioners if they live longer than expected with a deal that is the largest of its kind in the UK.It has created its own insurance company that has struck a deal with Prudential of the US to cover 25 per cent of the scheme’s total exposure to improvements in longevity by hedging about £16bn of liabilities – in effect promised pension payments.Such longevity deals have become increasingly popular because people are living longer than when most defined benefit pension schemes were set up decades ago. More than £9bn of pension de-risking transactions were completed in the first quarter of 2014.The BT scheme, which has about 320,000 members, is the UK’s largest corporate defined benefits pension scheme with assets of about £40bn as of June 2013. BT stated in its latest accounts that at the end of March 2014 its pension liabilities were £46.7bn.The previous biggest longevity deal was pension company Aviva in March, which hedged £5bn of longevity risk in the reinsurance market. In the same month, the ICI pension scheme transferred £3.6bn of liabilities to Legal & General, when ICI’s parent company Akzo Nobel, moved £3.6bn of liabilities off its balance sheet.The BT pension scheme’s new company, BTPSI (No 1) IC, has reinsured the risk with the Prudential Insurance Company of America, a US-based company. The BT scheme trustee declined to disclose the cost of the deal but said members would not be affected or see any changes to their contributions as a result of the insurance company being created.BT said the arrangements “will not require additional funding contributions from BT, as the costs of the longevity insurance will be met from within the scheme”.“The Trustee is responsible for the investment strategy of the Scheme and the insurance policy is part of that investment strategy. The cost has been financed by the Scheme as part of a liability management programme,” a spokesperson for the Scheme said.Frank Naylor, chief investment officer of the BT pension scheme, said the longevity insurance policy would form part of the scheme’s investment portfolio and would provide income to the scheme in the event that members lived longer than expected.However, Mr Naylor said it was “premature” to speculate what impact the deal would have on BT’s funding plan for the pension scheme for the next few years, which it is in the process of agreeing with trustees.“There is a huge range of things we need to think about with a triennial valuation, including market conditions as well as longevity,” Mr Naylor said. “You can’t draw any conclusions yet on the outcome of those discussions.”The trustee said in a statement: “By using a wholly owned insurer, the Trustee was able to access capacity in the global insurance and reinsurance market directly and achieve the best value for the Scheme.”Paul Spencer, trustee chairman, said: “This is a groundbreaking deal in terms of size, structure and with one of the leading life insurance companies in the United States providing reinsurance.“But more than this, the trustee is delighted with a transaction that significantly reduces risk and provides enhanced security for members.A spokesman for the BT Group said: “The arrangements will not require additional funding contributions from BT, as the costs of the longevity insurance will be met from within the scheme. You should not infer anything from these details regarding the likely outcome of the 2014 actuarial valuation.”BT this week began a nine-month review of its pension plan and analysts expect it to conclude that the company will probably have to inject equity to keep the deficit under control.Analysts at Macquarie estimate that the pension deficit will be £8.1bn, which would mean BT would need “top-up” payments of £700m-£770m every year above existing payments of about £325m.BT Group said nothing should be inferred from the deal regarding the likely outcome of the 2014 actuarial valuation.Q&ABy Josephine CumboWhat is a longevity swap?In a final salary pension scheme, an employer shoulders full responsibility for paying pension promises for as long as the member lives. As people live longer, this has created growing risk for employers who need to make financial provision for future pension payments. “Longevity swaps” reduce risk by allowing employers to in effect farm out longevity risk to an insurer.How do these deals affect a company financially?Longevity risk is one of the biggest risks faced by sponsors of defined benefit schemes so the swaps can put a cap on part or all of the risk. The BT pension scheme deal will see the US insurers cover over a quarter of the scheme’s total exposure to improvements in longevity.What is different about this deal?The £16bn BT pension scheme deal is three times larger than the previous £5bn longevity swap undertaken by the Aviva pension scheme in March, which was record-breaking at the time.What does it mean for the BT Group?The BT Group has the largest corporate pension scheme with £40bn in assets and £47bn in liabilities. This deal can help reduce the cost of future pension promises. BT is in discussions with the scheme’s trustees about a funding plan for the coming years. BT is not commenting on how the deal will affect its 2014 actuarial valuation, which will determine its contribution schedule for the next three years.

39;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-10-18T22:14:35Z;Prudential Financial drops opposition to stricter oversight;;Prudential Financial, the US insurer, has dropped its opposition to being designated a “systemically important financial institution”, in a blow to other non-bank financial groups that are trying to stave off additional regulation.The company on Friday decided not to mount a legal challenge to a ruling last month by the US Financial Stability Oversight Council that could lead to the imposition of extra capital and liquidity requirements.Other large insurers and fund managers had been watching Prudential’s decision, hoping that a legal challenge would circumscribe FSOC’s power and reduce the likelihood of other companies being designated as Sifis.Prudential “will continue to work with . . . regulators to develop regulatory standards that take into account the differences between insurance companies and banks, particularly in the use of capital, and that benefit consumers and preserve competition within the insurance industry,” it said.Prudential’s decision was being watched by fellow life insurer MetLife, which is also being assessed for a possible Sifi designation. That company also believes it does not deserve the Sifi label and plans to challenge the effort, at least through the FSOC process.Behind MetLife, the asset management industry is being examined by FSOC over whether the failure of the largest fund managers, such as BlackRock and Pimco, might pose a threat to the financial system.Analysts have been reluctant to quantify the potential hit to Prudential’s return on equity from having to set aside additional capital, until the Fed’s rules are clearer, and Prudential had been angry that the process of identifying systemic importance came before there was clarity on the regulatory requirements that come with such a designation.Jay Gelb, a Barclays analyst, predicted the Fed may hold off setting new capital rules for non-bank Sifis until apparent contradictions in the Dodd-Frank reform act are ironed out, perhaps requiring action by Congress. The wording of the law both requires the Fed to take into account differences between banks and other Sifis, and to impose the same capital and liquidity rules.The uncertainty remains a problem for shareholders, however, Mr Gelb said, because Prudential and the other Sifi insurers would be unable to extend share buybacks until capital rules became clear. “[They] may not be subject to stress testing until 2015 . . . Although investors should keep their expectations low for share buybacks (particularly for MetLife and Prudential), it would give these insurers an extra year to organically increase capital levels and prepare for increased oversight.”When FSOC made its designation in September, the two insurance experts on the council and the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Edward DeMarco, disagreed with the body’s move on Prudential.John Huff, director of the Missouri insurance department and the state insurance expert on the FSOC, said in his dissent that “there appears to be a lack of recognition given to the nature of the insurance business and the authorities and tools available to insurance regulators.” He added that applying banking standards renders “the rationale for designation flawed, insufficient, and unsupportable.”Roy Woodall, the independent member on the council with insurance expertise, said the FSOC’s assessment was not supported by facts or experience. “The underlying analysis utilises scenarios that are antithetical to a fundamental and seasoned understanding of the business of insurance, the insurance regulatory environment, and the state insurance company resolution and guaranty fund systems,” he said.
40;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-09-19T23:34:36Z;Regulators reject appeal by Prudential;;US regulators have rejected an appeal by Prudential Financial, America’s second-largest life assurer, to stave off “systematically important” classification, a move that will boost federal oversight of its business.The new designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council now brings stricter government regulation in areas such as risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity, the company said in a filing on Thursday.The announcement underscores US regulators’ attempts to extend their grip on financial institutions that have operated under little or no federal oversight.Other non-banks that have been classified by the FSOC include AIG, the insurance group, and GE Capital, the finance arm of General Electric – neither of which appealed against the decision.Prudential and others have argued that they are not as risky as Wall Street lenders and are not in the same category as the AIG of 2008 that required a $182bn bailout by the US government.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the company now has 30 days to respond to the designation. “We’re weighing both the rationale they provided us and our options,” said Bob DeFillippo, Prudential’s chief communications officer.While post-financial crisis regulation has focused on Wall Street, concerns have been raised that not enough is being done to improve oversight of non-bank financial institutions such as insurers and hedge funds.The classification of Prudential, which is based in Newark, New Jersey, raises questions over which institutions the regulators will turn to next. Another insurer, MetLife, is also being considered for the systematically important designation and is lobbying against it.The FSOC was set up in 2010 amid a regulatory overhaul. Its main focus is on financial groups outside the major banks, which are already deemed as systematically important.Additional reporting by Gina Chon in New York
41;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-09-09T01:41:10Z;Insurers back fund with focus on Asia and Africa;;Six of the world’s leading insurers are to invest in a new $400m private equity fund being set up to back companies that sell financial services to individuals in developing countries.MetLife, Prudential Financial and Swiss Re are among the companies backing the second fund being put together by specialist “microfinance” house, Leapfrog Investments.The group will disclose as early as Monday that it has raised $204m for the venture, with plans to raise up to $200m more in the coming months.Other investors include the financial institutions JPMorgan Chase, TIAA-CREF and the European Investment Bank as well as mainstream insurers such as Partner Re, XL and Achmea.The fund will aim to take stakes in companies that offer general insurance and life assurance, as well as savings, pensions and investment products, to low-income consumers, some of whom earn between $1.25 and $10 a day.It will be looking at prospective investments in south and south east Asian markets such as India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka as well as parts of sub Saharan Africa including Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.“A lot of people are saying the fundraising environment is quite brutal,” said Andrew Kuper, founder of Leapfrog. “But people [investors] are looking for operators [of businesses], not just clever [financial] structures.“People have become interested in Africa, parts of Asia . . . We see decades of opportunity lying ahead.”Leading insurers based in developed markets have previously focused their expansion efforts in developing countries on the relatively prosperous emerging middle classes. They have tended to avoid the high volume, low margin and difficult business of offering financial services to the world’s poorest people, especially given potential problems in distributing the products.However, Leapfrog said mainstream insurers are increasingly interested in the area.People have become interested in Africa, parts of Asia . . . We see decades of opportunity lying aheadLata Reddy, a corporate social responsibility executive at Prudential Financial, said: “People have been slow in coming to the realisation there’s potential in making money here. It’s a shift in mindset – seeing low-income [individuals] as consumers, not recipients [of charitable aid].”Leapfrog pointed to research from bodies including the World Bank, Global Findex and McKinsey showing there are 1.9bn potential consumers– only three in 10 of whom have access to financial services. Their total consumption is forecast to rise from $2tn to $5tn by 2022.The new fund is set to become almost three times bigger than Leapfrog’s $135m maiden offering, which it invested in seven companies reaching a total of 18m people.Leapfrog declined to disclose the profitability of its first fund, but said revenue rose by about a quarter on average across its portfolio in 2012 compared with a year earlier.

But what if you bought individual chocolates rather than the box?Replicating the Pru’s portfolio with specialist businesses is possible. For exposure to Asia, the obvious choice is AIA. It is larger, with $1.5bn of first-half operating profit against £476m from Prudential in Asia, so has more potential for economies of scale. And it has more exposure to China. But it is smaller in markets such as Indonesia and, overall, is not growing much faster than the Pru.The UK life and asset management businesses, which account for a third of Prudential’s profits, could both be replicated by Legal & General. In UK life L&G has the edge – its UK life profits were up 6 per cent in the first half against a 1 per cent rise at the Pru. With more than two-thirds of profits coming from UK life, L&G has a far greater incentive to find growth there than Prudential does.That leaves the US, where the Pru uses the Jackson brand. There the alternatives would be MetLife and the UK company’s namesake, Prudential Financial. All three are growing as the economy recovers. US profits from the UK’s Prudential rose a third in the first half, although an acquisition was partly to thank.So it is possible to replicate the Pru’s portfolio. But unless you do not want exposure to UK life or dislike the break-up talk surrounding the group, there are few compelling reasons to do so. By sticking with the Pru you leave the insurance asset allocation decisions in the hands of its managers. That does not come cheap. The shares rose another 5 per cent on Monday. On 14 times earnings they are at a discount to AIA but a premium to L&G and the US insurers. Nice boxes of chocolates never were a bargain buy.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
43;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-07-02T23:11:11Z;Prudential appeals stricter Fed oversight;;Prudential Financial has appealed against US regulators’ decision to brand it a “systemically important” institution, a designation that comes with increased capital requirements and oversight from the Federal Reserve.The second-biggest US insurance group said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it had “provided notice” to the Financial Stability Oversight Council requesting a private hearing “to contest the council’s proposed determination”.AIG, the insurance group, and GE Capital, the finance arm of General Electric – the other two financial groups named in the first round of designations – said they would not appeal against the regulators’ ruling.The FSOC, comprising the heads of the major regulators and chaired by the Treasury secretary, was set up under the 2010 regulatory overhaul. One of its main tasks is to identify financial groups other than the largest banks, which are automatically deemed systemically important, which could pose a risk to the financial system.Prudential said when the first proposed designations were unveiled last month that it was considering challenging the determination. AIG had previously said it can live with it. GE Capital had not commented.Both AIG and GE Capital have long been the posterchildren for the programme, which aims to impose on the riskiest “non-bank” financial groups similarly tough standards of capital, liquidity and supervision as are required of big banks.Both got into distress during the financial crisis, with AIG requiring a $182bn bailout from the US government, and GE Capital tapping government debt guarantees as its access to credit dried up.Prudential and other insurers, such as MetLife, have protested, arguing in meetings with government officials and in some public comments that they are not as risky as Wall Street banks, or the AIG of 2008 and do not warrant the same standards of oversight.Even after the council examines all possible companies and appeals are exhausted, there is not a fixed list. Companies can be added or removed every year. Uncertainty also governs what happens to the designated companies as rules have not been finalised. But the Fed has proposed minimum capital levels and a limit on credit with a single counterparty, part of an attempt to stop the domino effect of distress that was seen in 2008.
44;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-06-04T18:39:25Z;Non-bank SIFIs: question of risk;Being branded ‘systemically important’ is not trivial;Is the term “systemically important” synonymous with safe or risky? AIG, Prudential Financial and GE Capital were labelled systemically important on Monday as part of US government efforts to spot risks to the financial system from outside the banking world. Some 18 banks with $50bn of assets or more already have the distinction as do some financial market “utilities”, namely clearing houses and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. For the three non-bank systemically important financial institutions, or non-bank SIFIs, named this week officials studied asset size, debt load and mix, leverage and derivatives exposure. Others may be named, while regulators are mulling how asset management behemoths, such as BlackRock, should be treated.On the one hand, being a non-bank SIFI will mean oversight by the Federal Reserve (AIG and GE Capital are already under its purview) and adhering to “enhanced prudential standards.” Those have not been finalised yet, but could include holding more capital, denting shareholder returns. And, the heightened scrutiny, possibly formal stress testing, could be a distraction for management and shareholders.On the other hand, the companies may take advantage of additional oversight and prudence on things like capital, leverage or risk management to advertise themselves to stock and bond investors as less risky. Singling out some companies as potential threats to the system also signals that it is important to the government that they succeed.Being branded as systemically important is not trivial, but it was expected for AIG, GE Capital and Prudential. On Tuesday, the shares and credit default swaps did not show big moves. The three can contest the distinction, but knowing just how important it will be for investors can only come when the requirements are finalised.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
45;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-06-04T18:32:59Z;AIG, GE and Pru given risk controls;;AIG, GE Capital and Prudential Financial have received an extensive document from US regulators, explaining why they are big and risky enough to damage the financial system.Sent on Monday evening, the individual analyses of each group were accompanied by a note explaining that the companies would be subject to new requirements for capital, liquidity and stress testing from the Federal Reserve.One person familiar with the work of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which comprises the main US regulators, said the analysis focused on “transmission channels”.“If a firm were to get into material financial distress what are the impacts of the distress on counterparties, on markets, on the services they provide in the financial system?”Prudential said it was considering challenging the determination. AIG has previously said it can live with it. GE Capital has not said whether it might appeal. Both AIG and GE Capital have long been the posterchildren for the programme, which aims to impose on the riskiest “non-bank” financial groups similarly tough standards of capital, liquidity and supervision as are required of big banks.Both got into distress during the financial crisis, with AIG requiring a $182bn bailout from the US government, and GE Capital, a unit of General Electric, tapping government debt guarantees as its access to credit dried up.Prudential and other insurers, such as MetLife, have protested more vigorously, arguing in meetings with government officials and in some public comments that they are not as risky as Wall Street banks or the AIG of 2008 and do not warrant the same standards of oversight.Other sectors appear to have been let off the hook, most notably large asset managers such as BlackRock. But regulators are continuing to examine the sector, weighing whether some of its largest companies deserve designation. The initial set of criteria excluded asset managers and others because it was “very balance sheet focused”, said the person familiar with the process. That might be altered.Even after the council examines all possible companies and appeals are exhausted, there is not a fixed list. Companies can be added or removed every year. Uncertainty also governs what happens to the designated companies as rules have not been finalised. But the Fed has proposed minimum capital levels and a limit on credit with a single counterparty, part of an attempt to stop the domino effect of distress that was seen in 2008.Also unclear is whether there will be any advantage to being designated. Robert Benmosche, chief executive of AIG, and some Republicans who oppose the programme, have suggested that the named companies might be able to borrow more cheaply because of a belief that increased government oversight equates to a government guarantee.Mr Benmosche told the Financial Times last year: “There may be some value to being a Sifi some day – borrowing costs, perception, the strength of an organisation, how well regulated you are.” The Obama administration has tried to dispel that belief.
46;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US regulators name groups for more supervision;;AIG, Prudential Financial and GE Capital face increased levels of supervision and higher capital requirements after being branded “systemically important” by regulators, in a new system designed to identify institutions that could pose a threat to financial stability.The process has sparked arguments over whether the increased US government oversight is a “badge of honour” or a “scarlet letter” for a designated company. Robert Benmosche, chief executive of AIG, has spoken of the benefits, but most of the other companies under consideration have tried to escape designation.The regulatory discussion has taken almost three years, evidence of the slow delivery on a suite of rules mandated by Dodd-Frank, the financial reform legislation that became law in July 2010.Some officials said the extended time period for consideration was partly to ensure there was a robust process that could be defended in court if necessary. “They want to ensure they’ve been insulated against attack,” said Michael Barr, a former senior Treasury official and now a law professor at the University of Michigan.Companies that are designated are allowed to appeal, while other companies could still be added.Prudential said on Monday that it was “evaluating” whether to request a hearing “to contest the proposed determination”. AIG and GE Capital confirmed they had been informed they were being designated but made no comment on any appeal.The insurance industry had lobbied hard to escape the net, arguing that it is generally much safer than the banking industry and is being punished for the past sins of AIG, which came close to collapse because of writing risky derivatives contracts. MetLife was the largest insurer not to be designated at this stage.Asset managers such as BlackRock were not considered immediately. They are waiting on a study by regulators that will look at how they should be treated, according to people familiar with the situation.Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House financial services committee, criticised the system as “bad policy and even worse economics”. He added: “It also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy by giving these firms market advantages over their competitors, helping to make them even bigger and riskier than they otherwise would be.”Critics suggest that companies will be able to borrow more cheaply on the belief that being branded a “systemically important financial institution” implied the government would prevent a company from failing.Mr Benmosche told the FT last year: “There may be some value to being a Sifi some day – borrowing costs, perception, the strength of an organisation, how well regulated you are.” The Obama administration has tried to dispel that belief.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is made up of all the lead agencies including the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and US Treasury, has published metrics to decide whether a company’s failure would potentially destabilise the financial system.“Today, the council took another important step forward by exercising one of its principal authorities to protect taxpayers, reduce risk in the financial system, and promote financial stability,” said Jack Lew, Treasury secretary and chairman of the council.Despite the prolonged wait, the immediate names differ little from those floated in 2010 by Tim Geithner, then Treasury secretary. He said at the time: “What Dodd-Frank does, and this is very important, is make sure we can apply those rules not just to banks but to entities that are banks in all but name, whether you call them AIG or GE Capital.”

It will be able to borrow on up to 25-year terms, with the rate set at the time of drawdown.It is the latest in a series of investments by institutional investors into British social landlords. Last month Legal & General lent £102m to Hyde Group in a 15-year deal.Phil Jenkins of Centrus Advisors, who helped to arrange the Orbit deal, said social landlords were becoming more financially innovative in an attempt to diversify their funding sources, while institutional investors were being more proactive in developing new funding opportunities.“It’s a sign of a maturing institutional funding market in the UK, with institutions taking on more origination capability in order to do this on a larger scale,” he said. “Housing associations have been at the forefront, thanks to being a relatively homogenous asset class.”The deal mimics the long-term borrowing facilities offered by banks before the credit crisis.The majority of housing associations’ £60bn private borrowings come from banks, but in the past five years new long-term bank funding has dried up and they have been forced to look elsewhere. This has fuelled a boom in bond issuance and private placements are becoming more common, particularly with US-based lenders.However, in both cases borrowers face large carry costs on drawn borrowings. Anne Turner, Orbit finance director, said that not having to draw funds down immediately was an attraction.“We already have funding in place for our development programme but we wanted something more flexible that we could draw on when opportunities come up in the future, and we didn’t want to access a large amount of money from a bond issue that would then sit on our balance sheet,” she said.Other key features of the transaction were the long-term length and lack of currency risk. The overall cost was comparable to a bond issue or bank facility, she said. The funds will be used to build new homes and buy existing ones from other landlords.Institutional investors are also taking a strong interest in the UK’s private rented market. This week Prudential bought 534 homes from housebuilder Berkeley Group, while M&G is funding Wilmott Dixon’s plans to build 1,000 rented homes. M&G has also bought more than 400 private rented homes near the Olympic Park in east London from housing association Genesis.A government report by Sir Adrian Montague, 3i’s chairman, last year made a number of recommendations on how to attract institutions to invest in British housing.
48;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2013-01-21T22:45:32Z;Tech stocks fall out of favour;;A new year has not been kind to US technology stocks.Their underperformance is gaining momentum as investors price in poor earnings results and the shares of Apple are ensnared in a bear market.One of investors’ favourite sectors up until mid-September, when it comfortably outperformed the broader market, technology stocks changed course in the fourth quarter, with the slide accelerated by the fall in Apple shares, the largest component in both S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.After posting double-digit earnings growth during the first three quarters of 2012, the technology profit expansion is forecast to turn negative for the final. That bestows on tech an unwanted label as the second-worst performing sector among the major S&P 500 groups this earnings season, according to FactSet.Following negative outlooks, analysts have adjusted their expectations from an 8 per cent gain to a 3 per cent decline, which will be the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2009.Among big tech companies reporting earnings results this week are Google, IBM, Microsoft and Apple.Investors will particularly watch Apple’s results and guidance, due tomorrow, with a lot of interest, according to Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Warnings and downgrades to the outlooks have set the stage of very low expectations for the sector, so investors will be focusing on guidance and details about future demand before we see an enduring trend.”Apple is expected to report its first quarterly decline in nine years, according to FactSet. Apple shares have lost nearly a third of their market value since peaking last September at $702, immediately after the launch of the iPhone 5.The gloom across tech touches many corners with sharp profit declines expected to come from semiconductors, semiconductor equipment, office equipment and computers and peripherals, as consumers as well as businesses have been embracing mobile and cloud technology at a rapid speed, according to FactSet.“As mobile computing is getting more and more commoditised, traditional PCs will be pushed aside just like mainframe computing was pushed aside in the 80s,” said Roger Pine at Briaud Financial Advisors. “The Dells and HPs of this world, as well as enterprise software and semiconductors used in PCs are facing an existential crisis, something which we have been seeing in their earnings in the past year.”Indeed, investors punished Intel in 2012. The stock is down 15.5 per cent over the past 52 weeks, for being too slow to embrace tablets and smartphones. Last week Intel reported its fourth-quarter earnings dropped 15 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier, as the chipmaker noted the rise of tablets and a continuing fall in sales of PCs as well as a challenging economic environment.For all the gloom, some think the selling is providing investors with a buying opportunity.“The tech sector has been oversold in the past few months,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector research at Schwab. “A big rally up until summer prompted investors to cash in and take profits.”He added: “The technology companies are also well positioned with the cash-rich balance sheets, which will enable them to invest in innovations and acquisitions as well as paying dividends.“Third, valuations are very attractive – it is the cheapest sector, which is trading at 11.7 times forward earnings.”Wall Street was closed Monday for Martin Luther King Day
49;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-10-31T19:34:47Z;Berkshire bets on housing recovery;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has made another bet on a recovery in the US housing market, agreeing to lend the conglomerate’s trusted brand to a new venture with Brookfield Asset Management.Berkshire’s HomeServices of America unit will be the majority owner of a network of franchised real estate agencies, which will begin to offer services next year under the name Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.Brookfield will contribute a network of more than 53,000 individual estate agents responsible for $72bn of residential real estate sales last year. The group acquired the business last year from Prudential Financial, but did not retain the rights to the Prudential name, which are taken back as existing franchise agreements expire.Mr Buffett told CNBC this month that he remains bullish on the US economy, which he expects to continue “inching ahead” even as global growth slows.The billionaire investor said Berkshire’s businesses have already begun to see a pick-up in demand related to improvements in the residential property market, and as a consequence he expects them to hire about 8,000 people in response this year.The latest deal comes as Berkshire, a conglomerate with more than 70 different businesses, has positioned itself for a recovery in US housing as foreclosure rates decline and record low interest rates encourage buyers back into the market after six years of declining prices.HomeServices is the second largest full service residential brokerage firm in the US, the company said. Acquired with the MidAmerican utility company in 1999, it has been built by buying up real estate brokerages around the country. Berkshire has also acquired a brickmaker and this month agreed to pay $1.5bn for a portfolio of home loans from Residential Capital, the bankrupt mortgage lender.Mr Buffett’s optimism has also begun to be backed up by economic indicators. New home construction in the US surged in September to its fastest pace in more than four years, offering further evidence that the housing sector was regaining strength.Housing starts rose 15 per cent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000 units, the fastest pace of growth since July 2008.Brookfield acquired Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services for about $100m in December 2011, according to a financial disclosure. Brookfield, a real estate specialist with over $150bn in assets under management, has retained the relocation business separate from the new venture.

Its shares fell
18.8 per cent to $4.35.Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse warned that “cash burn [is] a concern” at OCZ.Other users of NAND were less effected, however.Fusion-IO, which manufactures some memory products that use NAND, climbed 2.3 per cent to $28.29.Hard disk drive manufacturers were mixed, although some manufacture hybrid products that use NAND.Seagate Technology fell 2.6 per cent to $31.70. However, that appeared to be largely a result of a downgrade by analysts at
Needham. Western Digital, Seagate’s larger rival opened lower but then climbed to $43.11, a gain of 3 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.9 per cent to 13,292.00 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.2 per cent to 3,135.81, also a post-financial crisis high.Truckmaker Navistar gained 17.4 per cent to $23.97 as the company used its quarterly earnings report to flesh out plans for a corporate restructuring, which executives said should produce significant cost savings.Wells Fargo analysts were unimpressed, however, refusing to give the stock a buy recommendation.“The turnaround will consume cash,” Andrew Casey warned clients.Among financial stocks Genworth Financial, an insurer which has some exposure to the eurozone periphery through a consumer debt insurance product, climbed 5.3 per cent to $5.45.Its rival Lincoln National also rose 4.2 per cent to $24.16.Shares in AIG fell 1.7 per cent to $34.22, despite announcing it would sell about $2bn of its stake in the Asian insurer AIA.Shares in Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, fell 1.9 per cent to $35.20 as the company posted an 8.2 per cent decline in sales at existing stores in August.Owens Illinois, the glass bottle manufacturer, was the best performer in the S&P 500 with its shares up
8.9 per cent to $18.78. The company was presenting to bank analysts at an industry conference, and reiterated its expectation to generate $250m in free cash flow during 2012."

Wells Fargo is on a drive to boost its international presence, while JPMorgan and Citigroup are expanding in commodity trade finance – typically the preserve of French, Dutch and Swiss banks.The US futures industry is highly concentrated, with 78 per cent of customer deposits held among the top 10 futures commission merchants.Jefferies Bache ranks 14th in US customer funds, behind Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as well as independents such as Chicago’s RJ O’Brien, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Patrice Blanc, head of Jefferies Bache and former chief executive of Newedge, said ranking futures brokers by how much customer cash they hold may have made sense when brokers were earning significant interest on deposits, but no longer.“Those revenues are all gone due to the fact that interest rates are at zero,” Mr Blanc said. “And that’s why it’s no longer a source of success.” Futures brokers also face the challenge of restoring customer trust after the 2011 collapse of MF Global and alleged fraud at Peregrine Financial Group.While Jefferies will not disclose recent results from its commodities unit, its most recent annual report said that Bache contributed $96.7m of net revenue and $31.8m of net earnings in the 12 months ended November 30, 2011.Jefferies’ decision to join the LME’s “ring” marks a vote of confidence in the acquisition of the historic exchange by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which agreed to buy the LME for £1.4bn in June.“With the lowering of the regulatory barriers and renminbi convertibility becoming a possibility, China will drive tremendous growth within our markets,” Mr Frawley said.He added that the cost of hiring a ring-dealing team would be more than compensated, since Jefferies has until now paid millions of dollars to other brokers to execute its trades on the LME floor.
52;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-07-12T23:18:36Z;Sale considered of ING Japanese unit;;Nomura is working on a potential sale or refinancing for ING’s Japanese business as the final round of bidding for the Dutch group’s Asian insurance operations approaches, according to people familiar with the situation.The Japanese arm and particularly its variable annuity business, which holds billions of dollars worth of difficult to hedge liabilities, has attracted least interest of the three main units up for sale by ING, which also includes its Korean and south-east Asian operations.Final bids for the units, which could fetch a combined $7bn, are due on Monday after parties that made it into the second round spent eight weeks doing due diligence and preparing their offers.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are the main advisers on the sale, Nomura and ING all declined to comment.The units are expected to be sold separately, or at least without significant chunks of the Japanese business, after two of the strategic buyers with most experience in Japan, MetLife and Prudential Financial of the US, dropped out of the race in the first round.Only one Japanese bidder, Dai-Ichi Life, remains, while other large strategic bidders, Manulife of Canada and AIA, the Hong Kong based pan-Asian insurer, are mainly interested in the south-east Asian business and potentially the Korean unit, according to people with knowledge of the process. Sun Life of Canada, which has a much smaller Asian presence, may also still bid.Mark Wilson, a former chief executive of AIA, is reported to have backing from a consortium including private equity group Blackstone and reinsurer Swiss Re to launch a bid for the full set. However, analysts and bankers with knowledge of the process thought it would be much more difficult for a financial buyer to get regulatory approval in all the different countries.Mr Wilson, who declined to comment, worked very closely with Blackstone’s advisory team on a planned initial public offering of AIA in 2009 when its former parent AIG of the US was looking to raise capital by selling the group.That IPO was overtaken by the ultimately abortive bid for the group from Prudential of the UK in 2010. Mr Wilson was ousted from AIA as that process collapsed in acrimony and Mark Tucker, a former chief executive of the Pru, was brought in to pursue a fresh listing of AIA in October 2010.Blackstone had been approached to work with Richard Li, son of Li Ka-shing, in his bid for the south-east Asian operations of ING, according to a person familiar with the talks. However, it did not believe the unit would be competitive as a standalone business, the person said.Richard Li is preparing a final bid for the south-east Asian unit and has plenty of funding since his billionaire tycoon father pledged financial backing for his son’s business ventures.ING’s Korean arm has attracted separate interest from two leading domestic financial companies, Kookmin and Korea Life.
53;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-06-06T17:48:33Z;Prudential’s GM deal revives annuities;;At a stroke last week Prudential Financial resuscitated a slumbering but potentially lucrative corner of the US insurance industry.The company agreed to take on as much as $26bn of pension liabilities from General Motors, for the assets backing the plan and cash payments that could total $3.5bn. The deal reduces the US carmaker’s pension liabilities by about a fifth.If completed, the GM transaction would eclipse anything seen before in the market for corporate annuities. The US pension insurance, or buyout, market is less developed than the UK’s. The last such US deal to involve the transfer of more than $1bn in liabilities was in the 1980s, according to Aon Hewitt, a consultancy.But it could be the tip of the iceberg. With S&P 500 companies facing combined pension liabilities of $1.7tn, according to Credit Suisse, and US states and municipal governments also exposed to defined benefit schemes, some say the dam could be about to burst on such deals.“This is a watershed moment,” says Rick Jones in the retirement plan division at Aon Hewitt. “The market has been in the doldrums for years but, if others companies follow GM’s lead, it could be worth trillions.”For Prudential the deal represents the first fruits from setting up a pension risk transfer unit three years ago. The unit has grown to 100 employees, while people who worked on the GM deal say MetLife, American International Group and Principal Financial, among others, are also seeking such deals.But while the financial crisis left gaping holes in corporate pension plans as the prices of plan assets tumbled, the annuity business has struggled to gain traction.“Over the past few years especially, US corporations have been keen to transfer pension risk,” said David Zion, head of accounting research at Credit Suisse. “But the key question has been price: with interest rates low and markets volatile, it can cost a lot to offload these long-duration liabilities.”GM will make payments of up to $4.5bn to its pension plan to fund lump sum payments to retirees who exit the pension scheme, and premiums to Prudential to assume liability for those who stay in the scheme. That will be partly balanced by a narrowing of the funding gap in the company’s pension plan, but the net cost to GM will still be $3bn.The deal covers all 118,000 of GM’s “salaried”, or white collar, retirees. But GM has a further 400,000 “hourly”, or blue collar, retirees with defined benefits.Bob Shanks, chief financial officer of Ford Motor, said this week that it had decided not to offload some of its pension liabilities because it did not have sufficient cash once plans for dividends and investments were taken into account.Another obstacle to the deals is their complexity. Morgan Stanley, the lead adviser on the deal, had been working with GM on pension alternatives since 2010.Oliver Wyman has been advising the independent fiduciary, which represents members of the pension plan, for at least six months, during which time at least four insurers submitted bids.Prudential may have to set aside $2bn against the GM pension liabilities, according to Raymond James analysts. That would be equal to the excess capital of Prudential’s US insurance arm at the end of 2011. By comparison, MetLife ended 2011 with $3.5bn and Principal Financial held $1.6bn.According to a GM filing, both it and Prudential could pull out of the deal before it is set to close at the end of the year if markets deteriorate and increase the total cash required to close the transaction.Despite these hurdles, insurers are confident the symbolic value of the deal with GM, with total pension liabilities of more than $100bn, will lead others to follow suit.Dylan Tyson, head of pension risk transfer at Prudential, says his company is in talks with several other large US companies about annuity deals, and expects further agreements this year.According to Raymond James, even after capital allocations are taken into account, the GM deal could add as much as $200m a year to Prudential’s earnings.“This [the GM deal] is not something that is going to happen every week,” says Steven Schwartz at Raymond James. “But we will see more deals, and when we do they will be meaningful for insurers’ earnings.”
54;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-06-01T22:27:31Z;GM cuts $26bn from pension liability;Largest ever annuity purchase of its kind;General Motors will cut $26bn from its $134bn pension liability by offering lump sum payments to employees and shifting pension plans over to Prudential Financial, an insurer.The transfer will be the largest ever group annuity purchase for a corporate pension plan, according to Mercer, a consultancy that advised on the transaction, and it comes as US companies struggle with underfunded pension liabilities that are estimated to total about $400bn for S&P 500 groups.GM will spend $3.5bn-$4.5bn on the move, including offering lump sum payments to 42,000 retirees and their surviving beneficiaries and paying Prudential to take over the risk of covering its remaining salaried employees and those who do not take the lump sum.“These actions represent a major step toward our objective of de-risking our pension plans and will further strengthen our balance sheet and give us more financial flexibility,” said Dan Ammann, GM’s chief financial officer.The status of the pension fund and its unfunded liability is one of the few issues left unresolved since the carmaker filed for bankruptcy under a government-led bailout in 2009.Pension liabilities for US companies are now larger than at the depths of the financial crisis, with plans hit by a combination of poor investment returns and falling interest rates that have increased the value of promises to retirees.For some years, asset managers and insurers have talked about the opportunity in reducing the risk posed by fluctuations in the value of corporate pension assets but companies have remained wary of the cost of filling in the funding gaps when interest rates are so low.The transaction was constructed over six months of negotiations between Prudential and GM, with rivals also submitting bids, the insurer said. GM will pay Prudential 10 per cent of the liabilities it assumes, in addition to transferring the assets, once the pension buyouts are completed.For Prudential the deal represents the first fruit for a unit set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis specifically to target corporate pension plans.“We’re certainly looking at other deals this year,” said Dylan Tyson, head of Prudential Retirement’s pension risk transfer unit. “We’re seeing more interest from US companies this year than we have in the last three years combined, and we’re hopeful this is an idea whose time has come,” he added.Mr Tyson said the deal would require the insurer to set aside additional capital, but would not impact meaningfully on regulatory capital requirements.At the end of 2011, GM’s global pension plans were underfunded by $25.4bn. The planned transfer will affect 118,000 US retirees, the carmaker said.The move follows a similar proposal by Ford Motor to offer lump sum buyouts to about 98,000 salaried retirees and former employees. GM’s competitor, which was the only US carmaker to avoid bankruptcy, has a $74bn pension liability which was underfunded by $15bn at the end of 2011.In response to stock market volatility both carmakers have also made moves to shift more of their pension assets into bonds which more closely match the character of their liabilities.

The private equity company, who just a day before had lowered its initial offer price, saw shares muted in its first day of public trading.Shares in Carlyle rose 0.2 per cent to $22.05.Visa, the global payments company, declined 4.7 per cent to $116.41 as it disclosed – in an otherwise strong first-quarter earnings report – that the Department of Justice had requested more information regarding its pricing adjustments in response to changes in regulation.Overall, Wall Street finished near a session low with losses increasing throughout the day, which had begun with encouraging labour market data that showed jobless claims declined at a faster rate than expected.Americans filing for unemployment insurance fell by 27,000 to 365,000 for the week ending April 28, the labour department said.The S&P 500 moved 0.8 per cent lower to 1,391.57 continuing a retreat that began on Wednesday when ADP, the payroll processor, said private sector job growth had slowed in April.The claims data, which came ahead of economists’ forecasts, will put increased attention on Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.“It is a bit disconcerting to us that the US equity markets appear to be laser-focused on a single upcoming economic data point: Friday’s jobs report,” said Sam Stovall, equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.He added: “We think investors could be disappointed, however, as the better than expected payroll gains seen earlier could be more challenging to replicate in the months ahead.”Shares in Groupon, which recently made changes to its board to address concerns over its bookkeeping, hit another all-time low and fell as much as 6 per cent. The company debuted its shares to the public in November at $20 but has seen its price steadily decline since it reached its high point shortly after. Groupon finished 2.6 per cent lower at $10.31.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.2 per cent to 3,024.30. Shares in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the index, lost 0.7 per cent to $581.82.Two of Wednesday’s worst performing technology stocks, Netflix and Research In Motion, extended their losses into Thursday. Shares in Netflix dropped 7.6 per cent to $75.97 as concerns continue to surround the growth prospects for the home DVD delivery and internet streaming company.Research In Motion shares lost 5.9 per cent to $12.04 as the BlackBerry maker struggles to convince investors of the merits of its latest smartphone.Whole Foods, the natural-goods grocery chain, was among the biggest risers on the main US market, gaining 7.6 per cent to $90.69. The company topped analysts’ forecasts by 5 cents, reporting earnings of 64 cents a share on net income of $117.7m in the second quarter of its financial year.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the company’s results were also aided by “confident wealthy consumers, an improved price reputation and solid execution by management”.Citing increased demand for its organic products, the company raised its full-year guidance and said earnings could be as high as $2.47 a share, 13 cents above current forecasts.Stephen Grambling, analyst at Goldman Sachs, raised his price target for the company’s shares to $92 from $88 but kept a “hold” rating, warning that it is trading at a premium to long-term averages.Shares in Prudential Financial, the second biggest life insurer in the US, declined 10.1 per cent to $54.81 after reporting a first-quarter loss. The company partially blamed its losses on fluctuations in the value of derivative contracts it uses to balance market risks. In the three months to March 31, Prudential reported a net loss of $967m, down from a net gain of $561m in the same period a year ago.Chesapeake Energy, the US natural gas company whose chief executive has been the source of much controversy, saw its shares recover 2.7 per cent to $17.18 after Wednesday’s losses.Bank of America shares declined 2 per cent to $8. In the first three months of the year, shares in the company were the best performing among the major US banks but have fallen 16 per cent since the start of April.
56;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-04-16T19:31:45Z;European banks: Lloyds and ING;They may share the same Brussels doghouse, but their predicaments could not be more different;This post-crisis bank narrative is familiar: forced seller seeks deep-pocketed buyer for prize assets in bombed out market. No, this is not a desperate Spanish lender. Nor is it a eurozone bank deleveraging story. The protagonists this time are Lloyds Banking Group and ING, both on tight European Union-imposed timetables to sell assets because they received state aid in the crisis. They may share the same Brussels doghouse, but their predicaments could not be more different. UK lender Lloyds, forced to sell 630 branches, has only one credible taker for its slice of mature domestic banking. Dutch group ING, however, has a queue of buyers for its Asian insurance business.Still, Lloyds remains in talks with preferred bidder Co-operative Bank – despite reports that talks are foundering. A sale to the Co-op is sensible: the mutual is a known quantity and versed at integration after buying Britannia. But the UK’s Financial Services Authority has qualms about the Co-op’s capital structure and management capacity. If these prove insurmountable, Lloyds has fall-backs: a £2bn bid from NBNK Investments, an unknown quantity, and a listing. Now is no time to cast branch and customers into the unknown. Nor do investors, already facing a £500m book loss on the sale, deserve such treatment. The Co-op deal at least answers the call by the Independent Commission on Banking for a new bank of scale. It would be off if the deal was blocked because the FSA could not agree on a safe structure.Buyer firepower is not in doubt as ING plans its $6bn sale of insurance assets in Korea, Malaysia and Japan. Instead, the question is whether Hong-Kong-listed AIA, MetLife and Prudential Financial of the US, or Manulife of Canada, buy all or part.ING’s Asian assets give it choices now. Lloyds must rue its long retreat from emerging markets to the UK.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
57;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-04-15T21:54:46Z;ING starts sell off race for Asian assets;;Bankers for ING sent financial details of the Dutch group’s $6bn Asian insurance businesses to a string of bidders late on Friday firing the starting gun on what will be a keenly fought contest for the units.The sale of businesses in Korea, Malaysia and Japan is seen by insurance industry observers as one of the last opportunities for any group that is under-represented in the world’s most promising life assurance markets to gain a significant foothold at one attempt.However, bankers representing a group among those preparing potential bids said it is likely to prove very difficult to beat AIA in the auction if the Hong-Kong listed pan-Asia group decides it wants the businesses because its highly rated stock means it is likely to have more firepower to offer a higher premium.MetLife of the US, which has Credit Suisse as an adviser, and Prudential Financial of the US, advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are the leading US bidders, while Manulife of Canada has hired Citigroup to lead its efforts. Of those three, Prudential has the most limited presence in Asia, though it has been growing in Japan through acquisitions.Prudential US also has a presence in Korea, but ING’s business there has attracted a lot of interest from local bidders who want only that unit, including Kookmin, which is being advised by Barclays.Life assurance businesses in emerging Asian economies are the fastest growing in the world as an emergent middle class begins to take measures to protect its improving lifestyle in countries that usually have little if any public welfare support. South-east Asian markets such as Malaysia and Indonesia are among the most promising, while China has huge potential but is very difficult to gain a significant presence in because of dominant local companies such as Ping An, and restrictions on foreign operators.Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore are much more mature, but still have the potential to produce good cash flows.Japan is the smallest and least attractive of ING’s businesses, worth only a few hundred million dollars according to bankers, while the South Korean and Malaysian units are worth more than $2.5bn each.It is still unclear whether ING will insist on bids only for the entire block of businesses in the first round in order to improve its chances of offloading all of them, or whether it will run a more open and flexible process that allows those interested only in one or two units to make offers for them, bankers said.ING, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, decided to sell the Asian insurance businesses separately from those in Europe because it expects to get a better price more quickly for the Asian units. It was directed to sell all the businesses by European authorities after receiving state support during the financial crisis.It has also decided to sell its Asian asset management business separately and retained Credit Suisse to run that process last month. The information memorandum for that sale is likely to come out later this month.

But, by Friday, even strong earnings reports by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could not stop US equities from their largest weekly fall since mid-December.Overall, the S&P 500 lost 2 per cent on the week to 1,370.26 and retreated further away from its cyclical high achieved on April 2.On Wednesday, aluminium manufacturer Alcoa surprised the market, reporting a $94m post-tax profit, and helped end the longest consecutive downward slide since November.Shares in the company, which was expected to post a loss, gained 2.3 per cent for the week and were 13.9 per cent higher in the year to date.Investors attributed the five consecutive days of losses that began before the Easter holiday to markets pulling back from the strong start to the year for the benchmark US index.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said: “We had a flare up in Europe earlier in the week, which caught the attention of US markets.”“Markets have done very well this year but the fact is we came into this earnings season overbought and something was going to capture the markets’ imagination to send it lower,” she added. “Europe gave a viable reason.”Rumours that China’s first-quarter growth rate would beat expectations carried stocks higher through to Thursday, but sparked a sell-off when the world’s second-largest economy said it grew 8.1 per cent in the period on Friday.The S&P 500 financials index moved 2.8 per cent lower on the week with Friday also bringing key earnings reports from two of the country’s biggest banks, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.Shares in JPMorgan fell 2.6 per cent to $43.21 on the week, as the US banking group reported net income of $5.4bn in the first quarter, down from $5.6bn last year. However, earnings of $1.31 a share beat consensus forecasts of $1.17 a share.Keith Horowitz, analyst at Citigroup, has a “buy” rating and price target of $52 for the bank’s shares, and said its trading and mortgage performance was particularly strong in the first quarter.Wells Fargo reported a 13 per cent rise in profit to a record $4.25bn. The bank said its earnings per share rose to 75 cents, up from 67 cents in the same period a year ago and ahead of analysts‘ forecasts. Shares in the bank lost 2.6 per cent on the week to $32.84.JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said: “The nice thing is that their earnings are good, even though their stocks are being punished on Friday.”The overall message from the two banks’ reports showed that the economy was improving but the problem was that for investors it was taking place at too slow a pace, he added.Bank of America and Citigroup will report their earnings next week. The sector index, which includes all the major banks, was up 16.1 per cent in the year to date and second only to the information technology sector for returns in the period.Economic data showed consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in March, in line with estimates but a second downbeat jobs report on Thursday suggested that the pace of the US labour market recovery remained unpredictable.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.6 per cent lower at 12,849.54 on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite Index moved 2.3 per cent lower to 3,011.33.Shares in Google, the internet search and media company, fell 1.2 per cent to $624.60 on the week. After market close on Thursday, the company announced an unusual stock split that handed lifetime control to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Under the split, Google will issue a new share for every share outstanding but the new shares will carry no voting right, leaving control of the company in the hands of existing shareholders, including Mr Page and Mr Brin who control about 58 per cent of voting rights.Google reported net revenues of $8.14bn in line with Wall Street forecasts, for the three months to the end of March and up about 24 per cent from the same period a year ago. Earnings per share rose $2 to $10.08 and ahead of the $9.64 per share analysts had expected.Brian Nowak, analyst at Nomura, said that he maintained a “buy” rating on Google’s shares and price target of $800 despite the revenue figures which came in below his estimates that were set higher than market consensus.“We continue to expect Google to generate 20 or more per cent revenue growth as it takes share in its mature and emerging businesses,” he said.
59;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-04-04T22:24:54Z;Appetite sharpens for equity ETPs;;Investors flocked to exchange-traded fund products to ride the first quarter rally in equity markets, with inflows to the products contrasting with outflows from equity mutual funds.Some $67bn was invested in exchange-traded products in the first three months of the year, with $50bn of that in equity-focused funds, according to data from BlackRock.Over the same period, equity mutual funds suffered outflows of $0.8bn, based on provisional figures from Lipper.Appetite for exchange-traded products, which tend to have lower management fees than mutual funds, grew as global equities enjoyed their best start to a year since 1998.But the preference for ETPs, which allow investors to redeem funds instantaneously and tend to track indices passively, over mutual funds could have implications for equity markets.“Investors clearly enjoy the flexibility of ETPs,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist at Prudential Financial.“But there is a concern that in an environment when investors take fright, the nature of ETPs could exacerbate volatility and correlation.”The popularity of ETPs, which include exchange-traded funds that own the securities tracked, and exchange-traded notes, in which issuers commit to match the returns of an index but do not necessarily purchase securities, is forcing conventional fund managers to take notice.In March, for example, Pimco, one of the world’s largest bond fund managers, launched an exchange-traded version of its flagship mutual fund, while Fidelity, the privately held US money manager, recently filed to offer a wide range of index-tracking tradeable funds.But rapid growth has led to increased scrutiny, amid concern that products could become so large they distort the markets they are intended to track.Despite the strong flows into stock ETPs, flow data suggest investors remain sceptical of equities as an asset class, with fixed income funds attracting stronger flows.Bond mutual funds took in more than $130bn in January and February alone, according to Lipper, while the $19.5bn flow into fixed incomes ETFs was a third higher than in any previous quarter.“Despite the stellar performance by stocks this year, investors are sensitive to the volatility they saw in equity markets last year and are not convinced stocks can offer stability in the short term,” said Matthew Lemieux, senior analyst at Lipper. “Where investors have come back to equities it has tended to be through ETFs, possibly because they have easier access to the exit if the need arises.”While the sector appears to be in good health overall, many new ETPs are struggling to attract assets, while issuers are increasingly competing on cost, eroding profit margins.
60;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-03-22T20:28:36Z;US retail investors bullish on shares;;The most active US retail investors appear to be embracing the strong start to the year for equities by investing more money, boosting hopes that the rally may have further to run.A survey of customers by Charles Schwab, which manages $1.8tn in retail money, found bullish sentiment among active investors – those making at least 36 trades a year – at its highest level since the company began gathering data in 2008.“We tend to see a pretty strong correlation between market moves and sentiment among our most active investors,” said Randy Frederick, the managing director of trading at Schwab. “This group of investors tend to be right more often than not.”Meanwhile, with the S&P 500 enjoying its best start to the year in more than a decade, outflows from mutual funds that invest in US stocks could be set to end an 11-month run in March, according to data from Lipper.The guarded response of retail investors to the latest equity rally up to now has been highlighted by many analysts as a potential source of weakness for the market.Investors scarred by the financial crisis have failed to return to domestic equity mutual funds in large numbers even as the S&P 500 has rallied 11 per cent this year and 23 per cent since lows last October.“What we’re seeing is a bull market by stealth with small gains on low trading volumes and few investors,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The rally will run out of steam unless retail money returns in large quantities.”Market bulls may be cheered by the Schwab survey, which found that investors are not only bullish but willing to commit more money to the market.Three-quarters of investors expecting a tax refund this year plan to invest at least some of it in US equities, while half plan to invest nearly all of their refund.“With cheques starting to arrive around now for those who filed early returns, this could provide a timely boost for the market,” said Mr Frederick.However, others are less convinced that a turning point has been reached in terms of retail sentiment.Although the rate of redemptions from domestic mutual funds has slowed in March, $2.2bn has flowed out of the funds so far this year, according to Lipper.Other investors argue that any return of retail money is a sign that the rally may now have peaked.“Retail inflows are a solidly contrarian indicator for us,” said James Dailey, a portfolio manager at Team Financial Managers, who is positioned for a 20 per cent fall in the S&P 500.“Typically this suggests that animal spirits have infested the market and it’s time to withdraw.”

The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15.

The insurer, which was bailed out by the US government during the financial crisis, said it expects to use the funds to pay down debt it owes to the US Treasury.Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries fell 5.5 per cent to $177.98 as Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that the company’s comprehensive natural gas price hedging strategy, reduces the potential for the company to benefit from low prices for the commodity this year .“While hedging adds visibility to CF’s margins, it may have left some profit potential on the table with [year to date] average [natural gas] prices near $2.60,” PJ Juvekar told Citigroup clients.Advanced Micro Devices lost 5.2 per cent to $7.07 as the semiconductor manufacturer said it would pay at least $150m to break an exclusivity agreement with one of its clients.Micron Technology also fell 5.2 per cent to $8.20 as the Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks fell 2.6 per cent.Micron, which manufactures dynamic random access memory for computers, had rallied strongly last week after a Japanese rival filed for bankruptcy, raising hopes of consolidation in the sector.Zynga shares fell 4.9 per cent to $13.97, after Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan removed his “buy” recommendation on the stock, after it briefly topped his $15 target last week.“We believe Zynga shares are fairly valued and could be range-bound in the near-term until we see greater clarity around the strength of newer games and their ability to increase both users and payers,” said Mr Anmuth.Groupon, the e-coupon company, dropped 5.6 per cent to $18.13.MetroPCS shares slumped 5.7 per cent to $9.96 as Sanford Bernstein analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on shares in the wireless network.“[The company’s] long term prospects are more pedestrian,” Craig Moffett told clients in a note. “Competition is greater in their core markets than it once was – due partially to the shifts down-market from Sprint and T-Mobile.”Polypore International, the plastics manufacturer of a key lithium battery component for the Chevrolet Volt, dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.91 after reports late Friday said Chevrolet would temporarily suspend production of the electric vehicle.Computer Science Corp rose 2 per cent to $31.93, as the company signed a letter of intent with the UK’s National Health Service, as it attempts to rescue a lucrative contract."
63;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-02-17T15:44:43Z;Wall Street rally shrugs off Greek deadlock;;Investors shrugged off delays to a deal on bail-out funding for Greece to push US stocks to within touching distance of four-year highs.The S&P 500 index climbed 1.4 per cent over the week to close at 1,361.21, just five points shy of its post-crisis closing high reached last April.The benchmark US index has now climbed more than 100 points in 2012, the first time US stocks have ever clocked up a century points gain by mid-February, according to Standard and Poor’s Capital IQ.The previous best points return seven weeks into a year was 79 in 2010.Apparent deadlock in the Greek bail-out negotiations briefly threatened to derail the rally on Wednesday as the S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent for only the third time this year but a fall in jobless claims to near-four year lows on Thursday quickly focused investors back on the domestic economy.“Despite the histrionics in Europe, there is a sense on Wall Street that a Greek deal will be hammered out,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That means investors can focus above all else on US economic data, which for the most part suggest this recovery will be durable.”Apple shares broke above $500 a share for the first time, peaking at $526.29 on Thursday before sliding slightly as the company pulled the iPad 2 from Amazon China because of an ongoing trademark dispute, while mutual and exchange-traded funds appeared to sell the stock as its weighting exceeded maximum requirements for a single stock.Shares ended the week at $502.12, for a gain of 1.8 per cent, leaving the company $60bn clear of Exxon Mobil as the world’s largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation.Apple has contributed ten of the S&P 500’s 100-point rally in 2012, according to Bloomberg, while its results have also given a healthy glow to US corporate earnings.Were Apple’s results stripped out, Barclays Capital estimates earnings growth at S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results would be 2.9 per cent rather than 6.7 per cent.Mike Walkley, a tech analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said its shares could hit $665 within a year.“Apple appeals to growth investors because its share price performance has been strong but it also appeals to value investors as its still trading at a very modest multiple to earnings,” Mr Walkley said.Apple’s stellar start to the year has helped push the Nasdaq Composite index to 11-year highs and the index climbed another 1.7 per cent to 2,951.78 this week.That would have been even better were it not for a dip on Friday as shares in Gilead Sciences fell 14.6 per cent to $46.82.Gilead said the majority of hepatitis C sufferers enrolled in a trial of one of its treatments suffered relapses within four weeks of completing a 12-week course.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent over the week to 12,949.64, closing above 12,900 for the first time since 2008 on Thursday. But the transport sector of the index fell 0.3 per cent in what could be a bearish indicator for stocks: Dow theory suggests the transport sector leads the rest of the index, as it is the first to show signs of an economic slowdown.Yahoo shares fell 7 per cent to $15.01 after the internet portal company's attempts to sell its Asian assets appeared to break down on Tuesday, triggering a boardroom rebellion by activist investors.JPMorgan analysts, who had argued that a tax-free sale of stakes in companies such as Alibaba could yield a $20 share price bounce for Yahoo, expressed frustration at the drawn-out process.Doug Anmuth wrote in a note: “A taxed sale … remains possible – and we believe that may be better than doing nothing at all – but we think the board and management need to arrive at a conclusion in the near term so Yahoo can focus fully on its core business.”Financials had a mixed week. Bank of America fell 0.7 per cent to $8.02 for its first weekly loss in 2012 as at least two analysts said the bank no longer represented compelling value after its 44 per cent rally this year.John McDonald at Bernstein Research and Keith Horowitz at Citigroup both said investors will switch focus from BofA’s capital position, which has improved markedly, to its earnings potential, which remains subdued.Morgan Stanley also lost ground, falling 2.5 per cent to $19.16, after Moody’s, the rating agency, warned it could downgrade the investment bank’s debt by three notches.Citigroup was flat at $32.92 and JPMorgan Chase climbed 2.3 per cent to $38.47, although Moody’s put both banks on watch for two- notch downgrades.Devon Energy climbed 15.9 per cent to $74.95 after the oil and gas explorer said it would cut back investment on new exploration and also declared a smaller fourth-quarter loss than expected.Other oil and gas explorers also rallied as natural gas futures climbed to their highest level since January, easing pressure on margins.Chesapeake Energy was up 11.7 per cent to $24.71 and Cabot Oil & Gas rose 9.2 per cent to $36.64.
64;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-02-07T23:20:53Z;Stockpickers ride again as investors hunt value;;The recent demise of “risk-on, risk-off” style trading across markets is welcome news to the battered ranks of stockpickers.Buying cheaply priced or “value” stocks has been a fruitless endeavour since 2008 as the financial crisis and eurozone debt problems have overpowered any sustained focus upon company fundamentals, the tenet of stock investing.Now doing your homework and buying undervalued or cheap stocks is finally paying off as equity volatility has dropped sharply against the backdrop of better US data and massive liquidity efforts by the European Central Bank.The risk, stockpickers acknowledge, is that the return of “risk-on, risk-off” could be around the corner. Just as the ECB’s offer of long-term loans has been a balm for markets so far this year, a messy Greek default or another macro event could yet trigger a significant sell-off.But for now, the turnround in value is eye catching and comes after some notable value investors such as Bill Miller of Legg Mason, threw in the towel last year.So far this year, the S&P Value index has rallied 8 per cent, ahead of the S&P 500’s rise of 7.1 per cent and the 6.5 per cent gain for the S&P Growth index.For investors in the Fairholme Fund, managed by Bruce Berkowitz, a leading value proponent, 2012 has already delivered a gain of 16.4 per cent, after its performance was crushed 32.4 per cent last year. However, many investors missed the rebound: Fairholme’s assets under management of $7.4bn are less than half what they were a year ago.The game changer has been the 25 per cent drop in equity volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix, which currently trades below a reading of 20, indicative of low stress levels.“Now at least for the moment, we seem to have a capital market that actually cares about fundamentals rather than the monotonous cadence of ‘risk-on, risk-off’,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. “It is a sign that portfolio managers are actually taking the time to assess what sectors and stocks hold the most promise and investing accordingly.”Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says: “Stockpicking is coming back.”Given the significant underperformance of value stocks in recent years, the stage may be set for a strong run should macro risk from China to Europe remain contained.The return of stockpicking and lower volatility has been accompanied by a sharp decline in trading volumes of exchange-traded funds, which fell to a four-year low in January. Declining use of what are essentially indexing products comes as no surprise with stockpicking back in favour.“Less volatility and improving investor confidence results in a more deliberate and discerning approach to buying stocks,” says Mr Paulsen.In turn, actively managed funds are leaving passive index funds behind so far this year. According to Birinyi Associates, the fifty largest actively managed domestic equity funds have beaten the S&P 500 by 1.24 percentage points in the year to date, which equates to an excess return of $12bn.Leading the value charge have been financials, where fears of being exposed to contagion from a meltdown among eurozone banks crushed the sector last year.Now the S&P financials sector has recovered sharply, up 12.6 per cent in 2012 and moreover its price-to-book ratio is back above 1, or equal to the value of the sector’s stated assets. The ratio is up from under 0.9 at the start of the year. Historically, such a low price to book ratio has attracted value investors who patiently bide their time waiting for vindication.Phil Orlando, who manages a portfolio for Federated Investors, added to an existing position in JPMorgan and purchased shares in Wells Fargo at the start of January.Those two stocks have rallied 13.9 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively this year, matching the sector, but lagging Bank of America’s 41 per cent year to date return by a distance.Yet it is still hard to find a value manager who has made the plunge into BofA stock, despite an enticing market capitalisation, which is just 37 per cent of its book value. Concerns about financial regulation remain high for the sector.“Stockpicking is not simply about attractive valuations,” says Mr Orlando. “We’re intentionally sticking to higher quality names – it may give less upside, but it allows us to sleep at night.”Mark Luschini, chief investment officer at Janney Montgomery Scott, has also looked at BofA, but instead opted for life insurers Prudential Financial and MetLife.“With new regulation and reduced leverage, the business model of banks may have changed irrevocably,” Mr Luschini says. “Whereas the big life insurers remain great diversified companies, and this is a historically rare opportunity to pick them up below book value.”Such blue-chip stocks that also pay solid dividends are highly attractive in a world where the US 10-year Treasury yield remains below 2 per cent, evidence that the bond market and the Federal Reserve remain cognisant that macro risk events still loom this year.In this environment, Oliver Pursche, a portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, prefers to focus on balance sheet strength and is enticed by the estimated $2tn in cash sitting on the balance sheet of US non-financials.Mr Pursche initiated a position in Microsoft, a company with $50bn in cash or short-term investments, in early December. Microsoft increased its dividend by 20 per cent and supported its share price with $2bn of share repurchases in the second half of 2011, and its shares have rallied 18.7 per cent to $30.35, since December.Value investors are also starting to spread their wings. Highly cyclical material stocks, which have climbed 12.4 per cent this year but are among the most vulnerable to a global slowdown, are beginning to attract attention, despite weaker balance sheets.Mr Pursche has been building a position in Cliffs Natural Resources, a coal miner heavily exposed to China. Cliffs has rallied 21.1 per cent this year to $75.51 after slumping more than 30 per cent in the second half of 2011 as fears over China slowing sharply have abated lately.“Our strategy is generally to buy globally diversified blue chips that yield high dividends, and our clients are comfortable with that, but some stocks have been beaten down so much, the valuations are compelling,” Mr Pursche says.Valuations meant precious little in 2011, but following January’s impressive run, stockpickers are hoping they continue to be a strong guide to performance in 2012.“If this trend continues, it is unalloyed good news for active managers, provided of course they get their calls correct,” says Mr Colas.
65;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-01-25T22:14:34Z;Fed boost puts S&P 500 in bull market;FOMC meetings leads to afternoon rally;The S&P 500 closed Wednesday in bull market territory after climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,326.06, a gain of 20.6 per cent since the close on October 3.The market had opened lower as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, added to pressure on the European Central Bank to take a hit on its Greek bond holdings. But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.
66;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2012-01-09T21:27:57Z;US consumer borrowing jumps in November;;US consumer borrowing rose by far more than analysts had expected in November as Americans opened their wallets for cars and other purchases amid signs of an improving economy.Consumer credit surged by $20.4bn – the biggest jump since November 2001 – to $2.48tn, the Federal Reserve said. That was well above economists’ median estimate of $7bn and nearly twice the high end of estimates of $11.6bn.“This is a positive for the US economy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It tallies with consumer confidence surveys and suggests Americans are feeling more confident about job creation and their personal income situations.”Consumers’ willingness to spend has risen as recent data have drawn an brightening picture of the economic recovery. Employers added 200,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate ticked down to 8.5 per cent, the lowest in nearly three years, in line with recent indications from declining claims for jobless benefits.Sentiment surveys have recorded rising confidence, and retailers enjoyed record sales on Black Friday, the official start of the end-of-year shopping season.“This [credit] number is unexpectedly big, and it might go some way to explaining the slowdown in retail sales in December. Possibly, shoppers had maxed out credit in November,” said David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott.The surge in borrowing was most probably driven by car sales, Ms Krosby said. US auto sales surged in November on growing demand for Ford and General Motors pick-up trucks, the carmakers reported last month.“Of course, the question for markets is whether this spending is sustainable if job creation remains slow and corporate earnings growth slows, but consumption accounts for 71 per cent of [gross domestic product] and, with corporations slowing spending, consumer spending is vital,” Ms Krosby said.Monday’s Fed report was also consistent with recent commerce department figures on income and spending suggesting that with slow income growth, consumers are funding their purchases by dipping into savings and taking on more debt. In November, savings as a percentage of disposable income remained low, falling to 3.5 per cent.Revolving debt, which includes credit cards, increased by the most since March 2008, rising $5.6bn to $798.3bn. Auto loans, educational loans and other non-revolving debt rose by $14.8bn, the most since February 2005, to $1.68tn.Additional reporting by Ajay Makan
67;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-12-30T21:41:34Z;US stocks escape worst of eurozone crisis;;The S&P 500 ended the year exactly 0.04 points lower than it started, although analysts found cause for comfort.“Given all the negatives that the market has had thrown at it, even to end the year flat is a victory for the US market,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It shows the attraction of US companies in turbulent times.”Despite a gut-wrenching August, when 4 per cent daily moves in the S&P 500 briefly became the norm, Wall Street escaped the worst of the eurozone crisis which wreaked havoc elsewhere, as the FTSE All World Index ended the year down 9.7 per cent.At 1,257.60, the S&P 500 had recovered 14 per cent from October lows, but was 8 per cent short of April highs.Once dividends are factored in, financials and materials aside, every broad sector of the S&P 500 has delivered gains this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.

The Nasdaq Composite index trailed, up just 0.8 per cent to 2,646.85.Sectoral moves added to the sense of confusion. The financial sector of the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent, handily outperforming its peers, with those stocks most sensitive to eurozone contagion fears performing best.Morgan Stanley climbed 5.5 per cent to $16.38 for one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and Goldman Sachs was up 4.3 per cent to $101.45.Other cyclical stocks have tended to follow where financials led in recent months but materials and energy stocks were flat.Refiners were hard hit as RBC Capital Markets analysts said the return of light oil from Libya meant complex refiners would no longer be able to charge a premium for processing lower cost oils.Valero fell 6.3 per cent to $21.15. Tesoro suffered most after Edward Westlake, oil analyst at Credit Suisse, told clients: “A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short-term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012.” Its shares fell 11.1 per cent to $21.79.Oilfield services companies also slipped as the Baker Hughes global oil and gas rig count fell for the first time since April when Nato action in Libya disrupted production.Halliburton fell 6.8 per cent to $34.08, not helped by allegations from BP that the company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Noble Corp fell 4.6 per cent to $33.04 and Baker Hughes was off 6 per cent to $50.39.Waqar Syed, Goldman Sachs oil analyst, offered some hope for the sector as he resumed coverage with a positive outlook, predicting fracking of new oil wells in shale fields will increase 18 per cent in 2012.Shares in DuPont fell 4.2 per cent over the week to $45.04 with most of the damage done on Friday when the chemicals group cut 2011 earnings guidance by 10 cents a share to between $3.87 and $3.95.DuPont blamed weak demand as customers run down inventories rather than purchase new products, which knocked rival Dow Chemicals, whose shares fell 2.3 per cent to $27.10.Good news for wireless network provider Clearwire was bad news for investors in its largest customer and principal owner, the mobile network Sprint Nextel.Clearwire said it would raise $350m by issuing new shares at $2 apiece, easing bankruptcy fears. Shares held steady at $2.15. But Sprint shares fell 5 per cent to $2.47, as investors balked at the $300m investment the company must make to maintain its controlling stake in Clearwire.Analysts said Clearwire is even more dependent on Sprint for capital in light of Verizon’s deal to sell products jointly with cable companies Time Warner, Comcast and Bright House.Positive headlines did nothing to stop another bad week for US solar stocks.News that MidAmerican Energy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, had purchased the Topaz solar farm in California from First Solar briefly lifted shares in the solar developer. But analysts poured cold water on the investment.“Let’s be clear, this is not Warren Buffett taking a bet on solar technology,” said Michael Horwitz, solar analyst at Robert W Baird. “This is Warren Buffett investing in a power plant that is guaranteed to yield large cash flows for at least 20 to 25 years,” he added. “The power plant just happens to be solar-powered.”First Solar ended the week down 4.4 per cent to $45.67. Solar panel manufacturer MEMC Electronic Materials climbed 3.3 per cent to $4.42, but analysts were unimpressed after management announced a restructuring that will see it reduce output.

The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,649.56.“The tape doesn’t lie,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “A knock to the EFSF rating had already been discounted by the market. If anything it’s a further catalyst for a positive conclusion to the eurozone summit at the end of the week.”MetroPCS was the standout performer in the S&P 500, gaining 7.8 per cent to $8.87, as Braxton Carter, the mobile phone network’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference that the company was considering bidding for new spectrum to meet the growing demand of a data-hungry customer base.“Store traffic has been very strong for MetroPCS so we expect good gross customer additions for the quarter,” said Kevin Smithen, telecom analyst at Macquarie. “The unknown is what the churn rate is going to be, its impossible to estimate how many customers are leaving.”Rival Sprint Nextel fell 1.5 per cent $2.61, as its wireless network provider Clearwire said it would issue new shares to raise $595m in new capital.Last week Sprint had committed to maintain its 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, meaning it must stump up around $300m of the capital raise.The dilution impact of the new share issuance sent Clearwire shares tumbling to as low as $2.09, but the stock closed up 11.1 per cent to $2.50.“Clearwire shares trade around the probability of bankruptcy, and that has been alleviated incrementally by the funding component,” said David Dixon, telecom analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Fertilisers were among the other big movers, after Norway-based Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertiliser producer, said demand would be strong next year, as high commodity prices provided farmers with an incentive to apply.CF Industries, the second largest nitrogen-based fertiliser company, climbed 4.3 per cent to $146.82. Potash producers Mosaic and PotashCorp were up 3.4 and 3.9 per cent to $53.19 and $43.54 respectively.Yara’s guidance comforted the industry, which has been rocked in recent weeks by fears that the weak rupee would lead Indian farmers to cut back on fertiliser imports or demand price discounts.Petrol refiner Tesoro lost 6.1 per cent to $23.31 after Credit Suisse analysts changed their guidance on the stock to “neutral”.Analyst Edward Westlake remained upbeat on the refining sector, but said other companies such as Marathon Petroleum offered more compelling value.“A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012,” he told clients.Marathon shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.64.Halliburton was rocked by BP’s allegations that the oilfield services company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The stock slipped 3.9 per cent to $35.57.Regional banks took a hit after Deutsche Bank said they may need to cut costs by as much as ten per cent to meet efficiency targets if revenues do not meet targets. SunTrust Banks fell 6.4 per cent to $18.03, Regions Financial declined 3.5 per cent to $4.16 and First Horizon was off 4.4 per cent to $7.43.LinkedIn Corp climbed 4.7 per cent to $73.20 after Morgan Stanley recommended clients buy shares in the professional-networking website, arguing its valuation was compelling, after steep falls in the share price in recent weeks.Eli Lilly climbed 3.9 per cent to $38.86 after Sanford Bernstein analysts said the current valuation assumed “extraordinarily low” expectations for the success of the group’s Alzheimer’s treatments. Tim Anderson, an Sanford Bernstein analyst said Eli’s market capitalisation could double if its latest Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, proved successful.3M climbed 1.5 per cent to $82.13 after the maker of Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes forecast 2012 earnings would be $6.25 to $6.50 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.27.

Varian was up 6.2 per cent to $60.60 after JPMorgan analysts told clients the German conglomerate Siemens would exit radiation therapy treatments, allowing Varian to gain market share.The S&P 500 finished the day at 1,257.81, on solid gains of 0.5 per cent. Trading had been volatile until midday when news that Italian prime minister-designate Mario Monti may form a government as soon as Wednesday triggered a decisive rally.“US markets have been given a reprieve for now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But that could be reversed in a second if there is bad news from Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 1,257.81.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.1 per cent to 2,686.2, with support from Apple, by far its most heavily weighted stock.Apple shares rose 2.5 per cent to $388.83 after ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told clients he expected the company to initiate a dividend policy next year.

a host of bellwether retail names falling on results releases.Walmart was off 2.4 per cent to $57.46 despite reporting US sales growth for the first time in nine quarters.Sales were driven by discounting that hurt margins, driving profit 3 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2010 to $3.3bn.“Walmart investors have become accustomed to earnings beats,” said David Shick, head of consumer research at Stifel Nicolaus. “But the company is correct to focus on expanding market share at the expense of the bottom line in the short term.”Walmart’s size and exposure to thrifty consumers have made it a favourite of defensive investors this year and it remains one of the best performers in the S&P 500.Urban Outfitters fell sharply in early trading, before riding the afternoon rally, to end the day up 0.1 per cent to $26.85. Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Barclays Capital analysts noted, however, that in local currency terms revenue was up 7 per cent year on year.Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $38.07 despite beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of 60 cents. Sears Holdings dropped 3.1 per cent to $70.03 after its Canadian namesake – in which it holds a 90 per cent stake – posted a loss of C$45.8m.The focus on retailers took the heat off bank stocks with the financial sector of the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 per cent, despite another sharp rise in the yields of Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $28.02 on reports that a host of hedge fund investors, including John Paulson, had cut their stakes in the bank during the third quarter.High-profile investor flight also hurt professional networking website LinkedIn, which slipped 4.8 per cent to $74.86, on news Bain Capital will sell its entire stake of 3.71m shares, when the newly floated company’s lock-out period ends.PepsiCo was boosted by news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a $146m stake.

71;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-10-11T23:54:08Z;Most hedge funds to escape tighter oversight;Planned threshold of $50bn exempts many groups;US regulators will examine non-bank financial groups with more than $50bn in assets to decide whether they are dangerous enough to merit tougher supervision and higher capital requirements – a threshold that will be a relief to most hedge funds and private equity firms.The Federal Reserve, Treasury and other regulators on the Financial Stability Oversight Council voted on Tuesday for criteria to designate companies as “systemically important”, a category that the industry has been lobbying hard to escape because of the potential hit to profits.The rule’s focus on size is likely to be good news for hedge funds – which typically fall below the $50bn threshold – and private equity firms such as KKR and Blackstone, but bad news for the insurance industry, where institutions from Prudential Financial to Allstate exceed the threshold. All banks with more than $50bn in assets are automatically included.Non-banks with more than $50bn in assets then have to fall foul of one out of a list of metrics to be designated, according to the proposed rule. They would have to be leveraged at more than 15 to 1, have a short-term debt to assets ratio of 10 per cent, have more than $20bn in total debt, more than $3.5bn in derivative liabilities or have more than $30bn of credit default swaps written against their failure.Officials stressed that the thresholds were intended as a guide and not all companies that breached them would be included, while regulators would retain the power to designate a company that they consider risky even if it did not meet these criteria.The rule was ordered by the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress last year, in a bid to subject more financial companies to stricter regulation in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the near-collapse, and ensuing government rescue, of American International Group.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, noted that the 2008 crisis proved that companies “outside the formal banking system” could cause “a lot of tensions and trauma across financial markets, amplifying the pressure on the broader financial system”.He has said he favoured a short list and suggested AIG and GE Capital are obvious candidates. Daniel Tarullo, governor of the Federal Reserve, has also said publicly that he favours a short initial list. According to people familiar with inter-agency talks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has argued for a broader range.Ben McKay, senior vice-president of federal government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said: “Property casualty insurers are not highly leveraged or interconnected and have a fundamentally different business model than banks, a fact that warrants different regulatory treatment.”Additional reporting by Helen Thomas in New York

That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently.

73;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-09-15T15:29:58Z;China’s Fosun to invest in overseas companies;;Fosun, China’s largest privately-owned conglomerate, says it expects to benefit from the current economic crisis by investing in European and US companies that can help it exploit strong growth in the Chinese markets for everything from fashion brands, to drugs, to financial services and even retirement homes.Fosun on Thursday announced a Rmb500m ($78m) joint venture with Prudential Financial, the US insurer, to sell life insurance products in China. The two companies said they have regulatory clearance for the new 50-50 joint venture, which will begin operations late next year.Guo Guangchang, Fosun chairman and founder, told the Financial Times in an interview that the latest economic crisis provides new opportunities for his company to make more such deals with foreign brands, high technology companies, financial services firms and others with specialist expertise or technologies, that need Fosun’s help to make money in China.“The list gets longer and longer,” he said. He declined to name names, but pointed to recent decisions by Fosun to build up strategic stakes in the European luxury brands Folli Follie and Club Med, and joint ventures with overseas pharmaceutical companies aimed at producing generic drugs for the Chinese market. Mr Guo said joint ventures with foreign drug companies that are strong on R&D can quickly turn a profit because of Fosun’s strength in the production and distribution of pharmaceuticals in China.Mr Guo, who is ranked 27th in Forbes magazine’s China rich list this year with a fortune of Rmb17.52bn, said he is emulating the strategy of Warren Buffett, the US investment guru, by taking a long view. “Fosun’s investment in the life insurance joint venture indicates our progress in learning from Mr Buffett’s philosophy of long-term value investment,” he said.Prudential Financial said it plans to leverage Fosun’s vast base of 400,000 employees to sell insurance products at the workplace. Mr Guo, as one of China’s top entrepreneurs, would also be expected to exploit his contacts to sell the JV’s products to the entrepreneurial class as well, says Mark Grier, vice-chairman of Prudential Financial.Insurance penetration in China remains well below average global levels, so it is viewed as a growth market by foreign insurers, but regulators requite them to have a local partner for the first five years. According to Fosun, life insurance premiums in China topped Rmb1trn last year but foreign life insurers account for only a small proportion of this highly competitive market.Mr Guo said Fosun also plans to choose a foreign partner to enter the retirement home market in China, which is expected to get a big boost soon from the greying of the Chinese population and a sharp decline in the proportion of elderly who live with their children.With additional reporting by Shirley Chen

Micron Technology was up 15.8 per cent to $6.35 and SanDisk rose 10.3 per cent to 38.73.Smartphone supplier Nvidia was also up 7.2 per cent to $13.88 after surprising analysts with its earnings forecasts.Regional bank stocks decoupled from bigger national banks after Credit Suisse recommended clients buy their shares.Analyst Craig Siegenthale argued that low interest rates are already priced into regional bank business models because most of their lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins fall over time as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $9.81 and US Bancorp rose 1.5 per cent to $22.00.National banks continued to fall on fears of exposure to Europe and a stalling economy.Bank of America was down 3.4 per cent to $6.98, Citigroup fell 5.8 per cent to $26.74 and JPMorgan fell 7.5 per cent to $32.08.Overall, financial companies in the S&P 500 were down 2.7 per cent for the week.Coal mining stocks were given a boost by unconfirmed reports of a potential bid from Anglo American, the global metals and mining group, for Walter Energy, the largest pure play coke and coal producer in the US. Those rumours followed hot on the heels of a confirmed bid last week from US coalminer Peabody forMacArthur, the Australian coal producer.Walter rose 13.3 per cent to $88.22 and Alpha Natural Resources, which has significant US coal mining interests only fell 0.5 per cent to 30.81, handily outperforming the S&P 500.Yahoo rose 12 per cent to $14.48 after the sacking of chief executive Carol Bartz and news that activist investor Daniel Loeb had taken a 5 per cent stake in the company.Mr Loeb immediately called for the resignation of the board of directors.Investors greeted the decision of oil company Sunoco to desert refining, closing its last two remaining facilities. Shares rose 2.2 per cent to $37.12.RBC Capital upgraded Sunoco from hold to buy, arguing its streamlined supply and logistics focus leaves it well set to benefit from the combination of, “growing crude oil production and insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity”.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, rose 2 per cent to $26.17 after the company successfully concluded its three-month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple Inland.The $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple stock rose 25.8 per cent to $31.04.VeriSign, the internet domain name seller, fell 3.4 per cent to $29.03. The company has announced the departure of Chief Financial Officer Brian Robins, damping speculation that it was about to be acquired.
75;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-08-18T18:29:46Z;Call to loosen bank capital requirements;;Banking regulators should consider temporarily lowering capital requirements in an effort to boost the feeble supply of credit to the economy, according to a top official at the Bank of England.In a powerful paper that drew parallels with President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s handling of the US economy and bank regulation in the 1930s, Andrew Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank and a member of its new macro-prudential financial policy committee (FPC), said the situation in the US in 1938 was “eerily reminiscent of today”.“Criticism of banks’ unwillingness to lend to the real economy was rampant. Fear in financial markets was mounting,” he said.Roosevelt’s response – to loosen banks’ regulatory requirements – was an early example of macro-prudential regulation, Mr Haldane enthused. “It worked. Lending and growth resumed.”The comments, published on Thursday, are the clearest signal yet that top policy officials see the merit of relaxing capital buffers in the short term, rather than pushing banks to build bigger ones as most regulators have advocated – especially if the drought in lending continues.Mr Haldane pointed to the slump in the ratio of credit to gross domestic product, a key indicator of an under- or oversupply of lending compared with normal levels. “Any further fall would put credit below its cycle-neutral level, implying a loosening [of capital requirements] to support risk-taking [is needed],” Mr Haldane said.Noting the signs that lenders are frightened of risk, Mr Haldane suggested the FPC could lean in favour of risk-taking. “The FPC, like the monetary policy committee, needs to act symmetrically in response to these developments,” he said. “Its job is to cushion the fall as well as arrest the rise in credit and debt.”Mr Haldane noted that the main task of the FPC was to protect the nation’s banking system against risks, including that of unsustainable levels of leverage, debt or credit growth such as those seen in the run-up to the financial crisis that began in 2007. Some parts of the system still had unacceptably high levels of leverage, he noted.“Yet elsewhere, there is evidence of credit growth being unsustainably low,” Mr Haldane said.Lending to the UK’s private, non-financial corporate sector has been falling steadily year on year since 2009 and is particularly acute for small- to medium-sized enterprises. These are particularly dependent on bank lending because, unlike their larger counterparts, they do not have access to capital markets.Mr Haldane set out the idea, popular in recent financial commentary, that markets are operating in a jittery “risk-on, risk-off” mode in which they run to, or flee from, risk-bearing assets. Currently, he said, “risk-taking is in retreat”. “And past crisis experience suggests that the contraction of lending internationally may have further to run.”
76;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Fund pursues yields from ground rent;;Almost £100m of capital has been raised for a fund that buys ground rents in the UK as investors turn to increasingly esoteric asset classes in the search for safe but significant yields.Pramerica Real Estate, the fund manager, has secured £98.3m of commitments for its UK ground lease fund, which it said had arisen from investors moving out of traditional assets such as index linked gilts into alternative investments that provide the potential for better returns with similarly low levels of risk. The additional equity has taken the fund to about £225m.Ground rents are seen as relatively safe investments given that they are backed by the underlying collateral of the land and buildings. The leases tend to be run for a long period, often hundreds of years, which can mean a long-term secure income for investors.The Pramerica fund targets leases of at least 75 years. Typical yields on such ground rent investments are 4-4.5 per cent.The fund has invested some of the equity raised in three recent acquisitions for £28.6m, including the ground leases of two well-known central London buildings. Charles Crowe, Pramerica’s director of UK real estate transactions and strategy, said: “These acquisitions [offer] very low risk income with the potential for an attractive yield.”The acquisitions include the 128-year ground lease on Vintners’ Place, a City of London office building, for £10.5m, and the ground lease on the Great Northern Hotel, King’s Cross, London, for £12m. This 999-year ground lease has been structured to give additional capital to invest in the redevelopment of the hotel.Mr Crowe said: “As well as providing an attractive, secure investment, ground lease sales also frequently benefit freeholders, as they are able to monetise a sometimes overlooked asset and deploy that cash in their business or the redevelopment of the assets in question.”The fund has also bought a ground lease portfolio of 184 holiday homes in the Cotswolds for £6.1m.Pramerica, the European arm of the real estate investment and advisory business of US-based Prudential Financial, took over the fund mandate in September 2010 from UBS. Launched in February 2007, the fund is an open-ended unit trust fund based in Jersey.Paul Dennis-Jones, Pramerica’s director of UK real estate fund management, said: “We are increasingly seeing that investors are looking further afield from traditional assets, such as index linked gilts, to investments such as the ground lease fund, which offer the potential for better returns and diversification for similar risk.”Ground rents have been a key part of the business of Vincent Tchenguiz, the wealthy property entrepreneur, who owns more than 300,000 residential freeholds, which he has in the past considered turning into a more structured bond-like investment given their steady income.
77;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-08-03T23:33:32Z;US insurers release mixed results;;"Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, reported increased core profits of $831m for the second quarter on Wednesday as revenues were boosted by two acquisitions and a sharp increase in the value of annuity accounts.Shares in Prudential, the second-biggest insurer after MetLife, rose $0.72, or 1.7 per cent, in after-hours trading to $57.60. The net profit of $831m increased from $798m a year earlier. On an operating basis, earnings per share were $1.71; analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.55 a share.Prudential said its profits for the three months to the end of June were helped by revenue from AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life, both bought in February from AIG, the US insurer, which reports its own earnings on Thursday.“Our organic business growth in US and international markets is bolstered by the expanded distribution opportunities and client base from the Star and Edison businesses we acquired in Japan earlier this year, with business integration on track,” said John Strangfeld, chief executive.The increased core profit excludes Prudential’s “closed block” of legacy business. Including that, profit declined from $1.1bn to $838m.Meanwhile, Hartford Financial, the smaller US insurer, announced a $500m share buy-back programme only a year after repaying government bail-out money. The announcement came after Hartford’s second-quarter results, which were pre-released last month due to charges related to tornadoes that devastated parts of the US earlier this year. Net income at Hartford fell from $76m in the second quarter of 2010 to $24m.Liam McGee, chief executive, said it was “an important action and the next step to ultimately increasing our return on equity and earnings per share”. He said he had consulted regulators before approving the share buy-back and would continue to “prudently” manage capital."
78;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-07-14T22:22:37Z;Wall St stocks fall amid default concerns;;Wall Street stocks closed down after an early equity rally amid concern that US politicians may fail to agree on raising the US debt ceiling, which could lead to a catastrophic default, and as investors reassessed the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s embarking on “quantitative easing”.In spite of initial efforts to look away from the possibility of Moody’s downgrading the US debt, equities pulled back after modest morning gains. Relatively good economic news and JPMorgan Chase beating earnings estimates initially helped investors gain confidence. JPMorgan Chase, the first big bank to report results, was up 1.84 per cent at $40.35 after announcing that its second-quarter profits rose 13 per cent to $5.4bn or $1.27 a share, in net income.“Bernanke’s comments took away the enthusiasm. The market reacted, as it is very much focused on negotiations in Washington”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 per cent at 12,437.12, after climbing almost 90 points early in the session, when investors were focused on the heavyweight bank’s growth. Financials, one of the worst performing sectors, are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue. Citigroup is due to release earnings on Friday.“But there were some good news in the retail sales and employment fronts, and good numbers from JPMorgan pushed it up a little initially. All in all, this is still a very cautious market looking at debt issues, both in Europe and the US, and the corporate earnings season”, Ms Krosby said.According to the US Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.1 per cent in June, after dipping 0.1 per cent in May, while weekly jobless claims dropped 22,000 to 405,000, compared to an expected figure of 415,000.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was in negative territory, down 1.2 per cent at 2,762.67 and the benchmark S&P 500 also closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,308.87. All of the S&P sectors lost ground, closing in negative territory.Yet ConocoPhillips was one of the S&P top performers at 1.6 per cent to $75.61, after an early announcement that the company plans to split its refining and production businesses into two different publicly traded companies.“We estimate the value range on a split-up is between $73 and $92 per share. Essentially, we see little downside to owning the stock at current levels. Overall, we estimate we can comfortably get to $80 per share on a break-up value,” said Faisel Khan, analyst with Citi investment research.“It remains to be seen how ConocoPhillips will deal with the downstream, how it will allocate the midstream and chemicals business among the separated company, whether there will be dis-synergies and most importantly how the upstream business will be valued. The upstream valuation is the key component here,” he added.Yum! Brands, reached an all-time high at $57.75 before paring its gains at 1.4 per cent to $56.37. On Wednesday, the US fast food Restaurant Group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, reported a 10 per cent gain in profits, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations and raising its full-year forecast. According to the company’s chief executive, David Novak, profit was helped by “strong performance in China and other emerging markets”, with sales in China growing more than 18 per cent.“Outlook for consolidated fundamentals are probably coming down slightly, with upside in China not fully offsetting weakness in the US. That said, Yum! is making the case for multiple expansion, which should be more important for the shares,” said Keith Siegner, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Google closed down 1.7 per cent to $528.94, but jumped as earnings results, released after the closing bell, exceeded estimates. The search engine group’s shares rose 12.5 per cent to $595.25 in after-hours trading.After hitting all-time high of $304.80 in early trading in the previous session Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, tumbled to $286.62, down 4.1 per cent. The company’s move to overhaul its pricing policy aimed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service has received criticisms and alienated some users.The microchip sub-sector was down with Microchip Technology, a chipmaker, down 1.2 per cent at $32.01 after reporting lower sales, and Novellus, a manufacturer of equipment for chipmakers, was also down 1.3 per cent at $31.58.Again, in the spotlight, News Corp tumbled 3.1 per cent at $15.43, following news the FBI opened an investigation into allegations that the media giant also hacked into the phones of September 11 victims. Also on Thursday, Rupert Murdoch and his son James, were summoned to appear before the UK Parliament, as a result of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal. News Corp pared in the previous session after the company dropped its bid for BSkyB.
79;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-05-11T16:35:28Z;Pru to moderate growth of US unit;;Prudential will take action to moderate the growth of its US business as its continuing sales success threatens to unbalance the group, the UK-listed life company said on Wednesday.Tidjane Thiam, chief executive, said the lack of strong competition for Jackson Life, its US arm, and the very high demand from baby boomers to protect their savings with protected retirement products meant the group was seeing very strong sales in the region.US sales were £322m in the first quarter, up 26 per cent on the same period last year. It was ahead of the 10 per cent increase in total group sales to £888m on the annual premium equivalent basis, which counts all new regular premiums and 10 per cent of new single premiums.The Pru continued to see strong growth in most of its Asian businesses, except for India, where sales slumped by 58 per cent versus the same period last year as regulatory changes have forced a complete product redesign. While the Pru expects things to continue to be difficult in India this year, the long term was still promising.“We have been continually surprised by [the US] market,” Mr Thiam said. “We sincerely expected the competition to come back.”The scale of the business being written in a single product line, variable annuities, where Jackson has grown its accumulated assets from about $20bn (£12.2bn) at the start of 2009 to about $50bn now, meant the business was becoming too large, he said.“It changes the very nature of the group it if goes unchecked,” he said. “We will pull some of the levers we have [in terms of changing the product] and hope the growth will slow down.”Demand has been very strong for protected retirement products, Mr Thiam said, because baby boomers had seen significant losses in their financial investments and in the value of their houses, which is often their largest investment.US insurers such as Prudential Financial, MetLife and Hartford, were hit hard by the financial crisis when they discovered their hedging on variable annuities was far less robust than they had believed, leaving them in need of large capital injections.Duncan Russell, analyst at JPMorgan, said he assumed the reasons for restraint were capital and a desire not to see the group become unbalanced.“While reining in the US is sensible for the structure and make-up of Prudential, we think that this is bearish for the shares,” he said, partly because overall group growth would be likely to slow and partly because in the medium term it would slow the cash generation from the US.Mr Thiam played down the idea that a simple way out of this issue would be to sell the US arm.This article is subject to a clarification

And yes, it involves a hilariously bad play on words.The “milk round” has become a staple of British university fairs, as big corporates and consultancies attempt to lure graduates with big salaries to pay down their tuition fees.For the little guys in “Digital Shoreditch”, as this week’s festival is calling it (could we settle on a single brand please?), a main source of competition for talent is financial institutions in the neighbouring City.The traffic isn’t all one-way: Iain Dodsworth, creator of Tweetdeck, was previously a developer at Prudential Financial, the US insurance firm. If reports of Tweetdeck’s $50m sale to Twitter are accurate (and it’s likely they are) that’s one way of catching graduates’ attention.Keen to catch them young, today a new recruitment scheme is launching – called, um, Silicon Milkroundabout.“Britain is getting its entrepreneurial mojo back,” says Ian Hogarth, chief executive of Songkick, the live music community site, and one of Silicon Milkroundabout’s organisers.“Whilst the intentions of the government’s London Tech City initiative are great, it doesn’t immediately help with one of our most pressing problems – recruiting talented engineers. Our greatest barrier to recruitment is that technical graduates – and many experienced software developers already working in large companies – aren’t even aware of London’s tech start-ups as an alternative to the more traditional routes of working for a bank, a consultancy, or for Google or Microsoft.”Between 20 and 30 companies are gathering on Sunday May 15 at Bar Music Hall, a large venue on Shoreditch’s Curtain Road, including several Silicon Roundabout stalwarts such as Songkick, Mind Candy (maker of Moshi Monsters), 7Digital, GroupSpaces, Shutl and even south Londoners Huddle.Their aim is to demonstrate that riches of a different sort can be found by working for small, entrepreneurial businesses. Further details and registration for graduates can be found at siliconmilkroundabout.com.
81;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-04-07T17:56:47Z;Jefferies to buy Prudential Bache;;Jefferies, a US investment bank, is set make a concerted push into the global futures market after it agreed to buy Prudential Financial’s commodities and financial derivatives business for $430m in cash.The deal to buy Prudential Bache’s Global Commodities Group is the largest yet undertaken by New York-based Jefferies as it aggressively expands beyond its traditional equities roots after the financial crisis. It also underlines how investment banks are starting to align their businesses to prepare for upcoming reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.Regulators of G20 countries are pushing to move more OTC derivatives trading where possible on to exchange and clear the trades through clearinghouses, to reduce systemic risk in financial markets. At the same time derivatives trading is growing faster than equities trading, a move highlighted by Deutsche Börse’s proposed merger with NYSE Euronext.Prudential Bache offers brokerage and clearing services in listed derivatives on futures and options exchanges around the world, and OTC trading in foreign exchange, base and precious metals and energy and agricultural swaps.The acquisition includes Bache’s UK and Hong Kong subsidiaries, which have more than 400 employees. It will be renamed Jefferies Bache. The business reported 2010 revenues of approximately $220m.Patrice Blanc, who joined the group as president of the Jefferies Futures Division from Newedge last year, will become chief executive and chairman of Prudential Bache.“The acquisition of the Bache platform provides Jefferies a unique opportunity to rapidly and cost effectively accelerate our growth in futures and expand our presence in commodities,” said Richard Handler, chief executive of Jefferies.The move also puts Jefferies into direct competition with banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Jefferies has broadened out into bond trading and rapidly increased headcount in major financial centres such as in New York and London after the collapse of Lehman Brothers precipated a shake-out among investment banks.Prudential, which has owned the Bache unit since the 1980s, has retrenched to focus on the insurance market.
82;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-04-03T22:00:46Z;Financial groups seek to avoid ‘important’ list;;"There is a new parlour game in the geekier circles of Washington’s regulators, academics and lobbyists: who should be on the list of companies deemed so important to the financial system that they must be subject to tighter standards?After financial groups built up risk that threatened to bring down the entire financial system, the Obama administration decided to identify future AIGs and Lehman Brothers and subject them to tougher capital and liquidity standards and closer supervision.As Congress debated the law that became Dodd-Frank, lawmakers wrangled over this systemic risk designation. Some warned it would crystallise the “too big to fail” funding advantage enjoyed by the largest groups by underlining the fact the government considered them crucial. Others said it would instead be a “scarlet letter”, a sign that profits would be hit by the new standards.Nine months after the designation became law, it looks like the scarlet letter brigade has won. Disclosures show a long list of companies and industry trade groups engaging in lobbying efforts – people involved with the talks say they are desperate to prove they do not deserve to be branded.Viral Acharya, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has developed a daily league table of systemically risky companies, which measures the correlation between a stock market fall and that of an individual company and also takes into account how much debt it has. It is an elegant way of measuring how tightly bound to the broader system a group is and how vulnerable it is to failing.As Mr Acharya points out: “In the end, it wasn’t a regulator who woke up one day and said ‘Listen, we are having a subprime crisis’, it was the market.”Bank of America is top of the list. Like all bank holding companies with more than $50bn in assets, it is automatically designated, but the top 10 also includes four insurance companies: MetLife, which is structured as a bank holding company and is therefore expected to be designated; AIG, which is also expected to be designated even though its supporters say it has shed its risky businesses; Prudential; and Hartford Financial Services.How to treat the latter two businesses shows the difficulties of the designation: they are both large and the NYU-Stern calculations show them to be systemically risky. On the other hand, the insurance industry is arguing that its companies enjoy stable funding and are therefore not susceptible to bank-type “runs” and that unlike AIG, they are not dangerously intertwined with other financial companies.“It’s absolutely the number one outstanding issue that we have,” David Sampson, chief executive of the Property Casualty Insurers Association, told a Chamber of Commerce conference last week. “Clearly it’s fundamentally a size-based threshold … [and] a bank-centric view of how they [regulators] approach their work. You’re not going to have a run on [insurers] … unless everyone in the country crashes their car at the same time.”Mr Acharya notes though that it is very difficult to argue convincingly that there is no systemic risk in insurance. As big buyers of corporate bonds, if they stopped buying in a crisis then corporate America would be forced to turn to credit lines with banks, having knock-on effects for banks’ funds. Mr Acharya’s league table only includes public companies – asset managers, private equity firms and hedge funds that are not on the stock market are therefore exempt.That might not be the case in the real designations. But in 2009, both Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, separately expressed the view that no individual hedge fund was risky enough for inclusion.That might not suit the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agency has been given powers to wind down a failing systemically important financial group to complement its existing powers to wind down banks. Officials there, in contrast to their counterparts at the Fed and the Treasury, want a longer list because they think the designation, particularly the requirement to draw up a living will, is important to the FDIC’s ability to wind down a future AIG or Lehman Brothers. But the FDIC is only one vote on the council of regulators.Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor, said last week that the initial list should be short and “treating financial firms of all sorts as banks could be both ineffective and inefficient”.Although some lobbyists worry that the council will ultimately opt for broader inclusion for fear of missing a company that later roils markets, the indications so far are that a decisive majority of its members will opt for a smaller list."
83;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-02-04T23:42:52Z;Competing with Twitter;;Tweetdeck is typical of many of Silicon Roundabout companies: it may not have invented Twitter but has built a business on its coat-tails.Tweetdeck shows its users a flow of updates from Twitter and Facebook, and allows them to create columns tracking particular phrases, such as a product or company.Iain Dodsworth, a former developer at Prudential Financial and BSkyB, created Tweetdeck in 2008 because he wanted a more sophisticated way to use Twitter.Two years later, Tweetdeck has expanded to include other sites, such as Facebook and Foursquare. It is now one of the most popular software for “power users” of social media, with more than 20m downloads.Tweetdeck is also flying the flag for British innovation abroad, becoming the first developer outside the US to be featured by Google on an application store for its Chrome web browser.Because the app is free to use, Tweetdeck is still considering how best to make money. One idea is to add a sponsorship to the app, while the recent release of Deck.ly – which lets Tweetdeck users break Twitter’s 140-character limit – provides a new platform for expansion.“We don’t know where social media is going to end up so we have to think about what’s next,” says Mr Dodsworth.While it is still on good terms with Twitter, Tweetdeck faces a challenge as the Californian company improves its own site and becomes less welcoming to third-party developers.“Let’s be honest – we are competing with Twitter on a daily basis,” Mr Dodsworth says. “We are fighting for the people that use the same service. Our users are a higher level and they want more – those are people that Twitter doesn’t want to compete for.”
84;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-01-13T20:31:23Z;Investors pour record sums into risky loans as prices rise;Leveraged loan prices trade at the highest level since October 2007;The prices of loans to risky companies have jumped to their highest levels in more than three years, prompting a flurry of fund launches.Leveraged loan prices are trading at 97.59 cents on the dollar, the highest price since October 2007, according to an S&P LCD index. At the height of the financial crisis, they fell to 63 cents on the dollar.Nuveen Investments has become the latest fund manager to launch a leveraged fund following similar moves in recent weeks by Pimco, one of the world’s biggest credit investors, and Prudential Financial.The moves highlight increasing demand to lend to companies through loan funds as investors deploy record amounts of money to this sector.Pimco filed fund registration details with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US on December 30 for a “senior floating rate fund” that would invest in loans, as well as bonds of US and non-US companies.Prudential Financial, the second-largest US life assurer, filed details this week with the SEC of a planned fund that would invest primarily in senior loans of companies that are rated below investment grade or unrated senior loans of comparable quality – known as “junk”.Nuveen Investments, the US asset manager, also filed with the SEC a loan fund plan in recent days. Its Short Duration Credit Opportunities Fund, invests in senior secured loans, second-lien loans and other adjustable rate corporate debt instruments.The leveraged loan market was “one of the few ways to hedge rate increases”, said Steven Miller, managing director of Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data, explaining the demand from investors for loans.Mr Miller said investors had also been drawn by potential profits to be made in the sector. Rebounding from the financial crisis, leveraged loans returned 65 per cent over the past two years.Last year investors poured record amounts of cash into funds that invest in loans, according to Lipper, the fund tracker.Loan funds had inflows of $17.4bn in 2010, shattering the previous record of $5.8bn in 2004. These funds had seen consecutive weekly inflows since June 30, Lipper said.After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, loan markets were badly hit. Banks stopped providing new loans, reluctant to take on additional risk by lending, particularly to higher risk companies. Moreover the ensuing market volatility led to a collapse in loan fund prices in secondary debt markets. The provision of leveraged loans was particularly affected by the crisis.These loans were used generously to fund the buy-out boom of the past decade, in large part because the rise of structured investment vehicles called collateralised loan obligations fuelled heated demand.All three fund managers either were unavailable to, or declined to, comment.
85;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2011-01-13T18:04:02Z;Prudential puts $500m in China fund;;Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, has agreed to invest $500m in a new Chinese private equity fund run by Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group that will focus on buying faded western brands and bringing them to the Chinese market.Fosun will contribute $100m of its own money to the fund, which will be on the lookout for investments similar to the one Fosun made in Club Méditerranée last year, when it bought nearly 10 per cent of the holiday resort company with a plan to revive its image and upgrade its China strategy.As manager of the fund, Fosun is particularly interested in famous luxury clothing, shoe and fashion brands that have fallen on hard times but could be resuscitated by tapping into the booming Chinese consumer market through Fosun’s extensive network of subsidiary companies.Fosun claims to be the largest privately owned conglomerate in China, with subsidiaries in the pharmaceutical, mining, steel, property development, retail and finance sectors.The company launched a $100m joint venture private equity fund with the Carlyle Group in Shanghai last year, marking the start of its foray into managing other people’s money on a large scale, according to Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang.For Prudential, this will be the single largest investment fund given to a third party to manage in the company’s 135-year history.Mark Grier, Prudential vice-chairman, said the US company found Fosun’s “theme of overseas brands matched with Chinese power” very attractive. “The Club Med deal is a good example of what this fund can do – investing in global brands that can do better with Fosun’s help by expanding in China,” he said.Mr Guo said part of Fosun’s motivation for partnering with Prudential was that as well as being “the second-largest insurance brand in the US” it was “one of the few US financial companies that did not require government assistance during the financial crisis”.He said the new fund, denominated in US dollars, will be managed completely separately from Fosun’s Carlyle venture and will probably devote about half its energy to investing in foreign brands and half to investing in domestic Chinese companies.Fosun is anxious to gain more international experience and start investing more abroad, including through acquisitions of large overseas financial institutions, Mr Guo said.“We are interested in buying things like AIA and we are now at a stage where we can handle very large scale deals,” he said.In addition to luxury and fashion brands Fosun’s new fund will also be on the lookout for investments in foreign technology companies, generic drugs producers, metals and mining assets and branded consumer products.

Investors chose to focus on the possibilities for future growth and Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, was optimistic about the prospects for growth in 2011.“At this stage, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter looks to be tracking at about a 3.5 per cent pace, and the first quarter is likely to enjoy even better growth owing to the initial beneficial effect of the payroll tax cut,” he said.He added that 3.5 per cent growth in the fourth quarter next year would not be “unreasonable”.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,258.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,559.49 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,671.48.Financials continued to lead the rally and were up 1.1 per cent.“They have been laggards throughout the year but there’s been a pick-up in M&A [mergers and acquisitions] activity in financials,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, who added that larger banks would benefit from an improvement in the US economy and a steepening of the yield curve.JPMorgan surged 2.8 per cent to $42.16 and Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.38. Regional banks continued to outperform their bigger brothers with Regions Financial soaring 7.1 per cent to $6.91, the most in the S&P 500, and Fifth Third Bancorp gaining 2.9 per cent to $14.71.Meanwhile, Nike was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, dropping 5.7 per cent to $877 after the sports brand’s future order figures were below analyst expectations, even though they forecast orders would rise 11 per cent. The company also said that it might have to increase prices on some items to offset the rising cost of cotton, labour and transport. But it added that while this would weigh on results in the second half of this fiscal year, the pressure should ease over the next 12 to 18 months.But earnings beat expectations in its second quarter. Analysts at FBR Capital Markets reiterated their “outperform” rating for the stock and raised its price target from $90 to $98.“Strong sales momentum and margin expansion continued in [the second quarter] as Nike exploits the power of its business model and brand strength to drive growth, not only through continued penetration of emerging global markets, its greatest opportunity, but also through impressive strength in mature markets,” they said.They added that the strength of the Nike brand should make it easier to pass along cost increases to the consumer.Walgreen jumped 5.5 per cent to $38.85 after the pharmacy chain posted a first-quarter profit that beat expectations. Prescription sales rose while the retailer opened stores at a slower pace, controlling costs.In technology, Dell edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $13.88 after it continued its expansion into cloud computing by buying medical archiving company InSite One for an undisclosed sum. Red Hat became the latest tech group to report its quarterly results. The seller of the Linux operating system slipped from its 52-week high, slumping
2.5 per cent to $46.70.Third-quarter revenue rose 21 per cent and earnings per share matched Wall Street’s expectations.The software maker followed Adobe and other technology companies and issued an optimistic outlook, forecasting profit and revenue above the average analyst expectationsElsewhere in technology, Microsoft said it was working on a version of its Windows operating systems for devices including tablet computers. Microsoft added 0.4 per cent to $28.19.But shares in Intel dipped 1 per cent to $20.89 because it was reported that Microsoft has plans to run the new version using chips from Intel’s UK rival Arm Holdings.

The broker upgraded Anglo to “outperform” with a £36 target.The wider market went nowhere as volumes remained below average levels. The FTSE closed down 0.2 per cent or 9.03 points to 5,882.18 as financial stocks provided the main drag.Barclays led the blue-chip fallers, losing 3.7 per cent to 262p, after Moody’s warned Spain that its debt rating could be downgraded. Barclays has about £39bn of loan exposure to Spain, more than half of which is in residential mortgages, Macquarie analysts estimated.Precious-metals miners were weak after the Federal Reserve’s decision on Tuesday not to increase its Treasury buying programme sent gold lower. Fresnillo lost 2.5 per cent to £15.55 and Randgold Resources was 2 per cent weaker at £56.55.Among the gainers, Capital Shopping Centres rose 4.8 per cent to 415½p after rebel shareholder Simon Property made an indicative 425p-a-share takeover offer. CSC rejected the proposal as too low and too vague.Rexam jumped 3.8 per cent to 322½p on confirmation that it was looking at selling the speciality lid-making unit, which accounts for about a third of its plastics packaging division.“Rexam would free itself of the weakest link in its plastics portfolio,” said Merrill Lynch. “This would leave Plastics with reasonably attractive, niche positions in healthcare and personal closures [both profitable and growing] to complement the beverage can business.”Scottish & Southern Energy climbed 1.4 per cent to £11.66 on continued speculation of a break-up bid, with E.on rumoured to be among the interested parties. SSE shares were also helped by Deutsche Bank “buy” advice as part of a sector review.Autonomy rose 4.8 per cent to £14.75. One theory was that the software maker was set to announce an acquisition, though traders said the strength may also have reflected end-of-year short covering. About 3.8 per cent of Autonomy shares are out on loan, equivalent to 6.5 days’ average volume, according to Data Explorers.AstraZeneca rose 1.4 per cent to £31.49 ahead of the US drug regulator’s decision due Thursday on its Brilinta blood thinner, with the treatment widely expected to be approved.Morgan Stanley, AstraZeneca’s house broker, forecast Brilinta to generate peak sales of $3.3bn compared with a consensus of $1.9bn. It also expected AstraZeneca to spend $42bn on dividends and share buy-backs before 2014, which it said was 20 per cent more than market expectations.Among the mid-caps, Betfair bounced 5.6 per cent to £10.45 as BarCap argued that Tuesday’s post-results slump was an overreaction. The broker upgraded the company to “overweight” with a £13 target price.Supergroup, the fashion retailer that was floated at 500p in March, dropped 10.9 per cent to £14.50 after results triggered profit-taking. Traders blamed the drop on a cautious comment regarding rising cotton prices, which was compounded by an untidy “sell” order early in the session.MAM Funds was up 26.8 per cent to 35½p after the asset manager appointed former Gartmore fund manager Gervais Williams as a managing director. In addition, MAM announced plans to raise £20m via a share issue at 33p each to repay debt and preference shares, write Neil Hume and Bryce Elder.Pursuit Dynamics, the fluid technology company, rallied 0.6 per cent to 493p after its new finance director declared the purchase of 5,000 shares. The stock had dropped sharply on Tuesday amid pressure from short sellers.Renovo jumped 16.7 per cent to 56p after Roger Pannone, the drug developer’s chairman, declared the purchase of 20,000 shares at 48.8p each. Nomura analysts highlighted signs of progress for the group’s Juvidex scar reduction treatment in recent results.“For Juvidex, the company has clearly advanced partnering discussions and is now guiding to a deal being concluded ‘late 2010/early 2011’,” it noted.Brewin Dolphin, the wealth management company, fell 5.6 per cent to 151p as funds that tracked the small cap index were forced to sell stock ahead of the company’s promotion to the FTSE 250. Brewin is taking the place of BlueBay Asset Management, which is being acquired by Royal Bank of Canada.Local Shopping Reit gained 1.3 per cent to 56¼p after Matrix upgraded it to “add” in response to the property group’s forming of a £100m joint venture with Pramerica, Prudential Financial’s real-estate unit.Indonesia-based Sound Oil slipped 6.9 per cent to 1.35p after it announced plans to buy Consul Oil & Gas, which has 17 exploration licences and applications in Italy.Sound Oil said it would help pay for the deal by placing shares at 1.2p share to raise £3.7m.Xcite Energy dropped 11.3 per cent to 225½p on news that critical testing of its Bentley heavy oil field in the North Sea had been further delayed because of an operational problem.
88;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-12-01T03:24:34Z;AIG returns to bond market;;AIG paid a premium on its return to the credit markets with its first bond sale since its rescue by the government two years ago.The insurer sold $2bn of bonds with a $1.5bn tranche priced at a spread, or risk premium of 362.5 basis points over US Treasuries.The bond sale comes after its $180bn bail-out at the height of the financial crisis and after the company this year unveiled a plan to reclaim its independence.The insurer has raised considerable cash through the sale of businesses and other assets.In the third quarter, the company had a net loss of $2.4bn after recording more than $3bn in writedowns on assets that are being sold to repay US bail-out funds.Bond investors said the deal was well received, but that AIG offered yields that were much higher than those of similarly rated insurers.“It is definitely cheap for the rating, but the rating implies a certain level of government support,” said Derrick Wulf, head of interest rates at Dwight Asset Management. “Without the government support, some would put it as below investment grade.”AIG is rated single A minus by Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. S&P says that its credit rating on AIG includes a five-notch uplift from its assessment of the company’s standalone credit profile, which is junk-rated double B.Bonds due in 2020 issued by Prudential Financial trade at a spread of 180bps over Treasuries, while debt due in 2019 issued by Allstate trades at a risk premium of 135bps over Treasuries, according to investors. Prudential is rated single A and Baa2 while Allstate is rated single A minus and A3.“There are still a lot of moving parts, not the least of which is big government ownership,” said Lon Erickson, managing director at Thornburg Investment Management. “For a lot of different reasons, they are paying a nice premium.”Robert Benmosche, AIG’s chief executive, said in November that the company planned to sell stock as well as bonds.At the end of September, the federal government owned $95.6bn of AIG debt and equity. Since then AIG has raised $37bn in asset sales.The yields appeared to be enough to compensate investors for lingering concerns about AIG’s future and the stigma of its dramatic collapse.A person familiar with the deal said that orders totalled $8bn and that the bonds were priced at risk premiums that were less than that which the company initially offered.“Despite the formal rating, we view the risk profile as more high-yield, which is how this deal is being priced,” said Sabur Moini, portfolio manager for the Payden High Income Fund.A US Treasury spokesman said: “AIG’s ability to access private financing is an important step for the company toward future independence. It demonstrates growing market confidence in the progress AIG has made both in stabilising its operations and in putting itself in a position to repay all of its obligations to US taxpayers.”Additional reporting by Justin Baer in New York
89;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-11-28T22:35:51Z;Local Shopping teams up with US buy-out group;;Local Shopping REIT, the retail property specialist, is planning to launch a £100m venture to acquire high street shops around the UK backed by Pramerica Real Estate Partners, the US property investment group of Prudential Financial.The listed company has agreed a deal that will see the US private equity firm inject about £30m into a joint venture structure in addition to equity provided by the group, which will also take a management fee for the properties. In total, there is expected to be more than £37m of capital to buy convenience retail outlets, which will be boosted to an investment war chest of £100m through the use of debt.The deal, which is expected to be announced soon, is the latest sign of companies in the real estate investment trust sector using their property management skills alongside third party equity rather than just using their own balance sheets. It allows them to secure medium term fee income separate from the movements of the property market, and additional firepower when purchasing in competitive auctions.Although groups such as Pramerica have their own large management teams across the world, partnering smaller companies such as Local Shopping REIT allows them access to more micro markets where knowing the local area and property professionals is crucial to driving returns.This venture is expected to focus on local retail parades and precincts across the UK with potential for future rental growth and the opportunity to add further value through asset management and development. The average investment size is expected to be relatively small at about £5m per deal, although the venture can acquire larger portfolios. There is seen to be an opportunity in retail locations where convenience and budget retailers are keen to expand.Although smaller companies such as Quintain and Capital & Regional have ambitions to drive revenues through such management initiatives, even the largest companies in the sector have targeted the large pools of overseas money that want to buy in the UK to use their deeper pockets in joint ventures. Local Shopping REIT already manages assets on behalf of other parties, including two banks. The venture with Pramerica is already understood to have acquired one property. All parties declined to comment.

It will be the sole investor in the fund, which could see its spending power increase to $1bn. The fund will mainly invest in property in countries such as Australia, Japan and China.“We need to diversify our portfolio, increasing exposure to different asset classes and different countries,” said Kim Ha-young, an NPS official. “Direct property investments abroad have delivered high returns of about 13 per cent so far.”Lee Yoon-pyo, an NPS director in charge of overseas alternative investments, said the latest investment is more of a diversification strategy, following its investment in European property funds. It also plans to invest in a US property fund soon.Analysts said the fund sees such property investments as guaranteeing stable returns in spite of fears that a bubble is forming in some Asian property markets. In January, the fund announced the purchase of an office building in Sydney.The NPS has been on the acquisition trail following the instalment of a new chairman, Jun Kwang-woo, in December. Given the expected growth in its investment pool, overseas expansion is a must for the pension fund, experts say, as more than 70 per cent of the fund is still in domestic fixed-income holdings.International property currently comprises less than 1 per cent of the fund’s portfolio but the NPS has rapidly boosted its exposure – especially in Europe, where slowing economic growth has pushed down valuations. The South Korean fund bought HSBC’s Canary Wharf headquarters for £773m ($1.2bn) last year and took a 12 per cent stake in the UK’s Gatwick airport this year.The fund recently agreed to invest another $400m in the European market through Rockspring, the UK property asset manager. The NPS said in August that it was in talks to buy a 51 per cent stake in a large shopping mall near Paris.It is also expanding into international infrastructure and is in talks to buy a stake in a US oil pipeline operator.
92;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-09-30T23:11:53Z;AIG to sell two Japanese units to US group;;American International Group has agreed to sell two Japanese life assurance subsidiaries to Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, for $4.8bn.Prudential Financial, which already has two life assurance units in Japan, is acquiring AIG Star Life Insurance Company and AIG Edison Insurance Company, making it the largest foreign insurance group in Japan with premium income of an estimated Y1,423bn ($17bn).“The addition of these operations to our existing businesses in Japan will increase our presence and give us opportunities to provide our quality service to more customers,” said John Strangfeld, chairman and chief executive of Prudential Financial.The acquisition comes as Japan’s life assurance market, one of the largest in the world, has been under pressure from an ageing population.Nevertheless, adding two companies, which have a considerable presence in Japan’s insurance market, will help Prudential Financial compete more effectively against domestic rivals, analysts say.AIG Edison and AIG Star posted combined premium income of close to Y500bn in the year to March 2010.The sale effectively marks AIG’s exit from Japan’s life assurance market, although it will retain a small life assurance company, which is part of Fuji Kasai, a local assurer in which AIG has a stake of about 55 per cent.AIG, like many foreign insurers, expanded in the Japanese market by acquiring bankrupt domestic life insurers in the early 2000s.AIG, which is focusing its overseas operations on non-life insurance, will retain its two non-life insurance units in Japan, AIU Insurance and American Home Insurance.Those businesses represented an 8 per cent share of Japan’s non-life insurance market, or Y623.8bn in revenues, last year, AIG said.While Japan’s non-life insurance market is also suffering a decline in revenues and Japanese companies are looking to expand overseas, AIG said its strengths are in areas, such as accident, medical and liability insurance, which are still seeing firm growth.The troubled US group has already sold its long-held Japanese building in the heart of Tokyo’s business district, for $1.2bn to Nippon Life Insurance.AIG also sold its Alico life insurance group, which included a Japanese unit, to MetLife for $15.5bn in March, which includes a Japanese unit.

It had been forecast to fall to 460,000.“Claims numbers in particular show that at a minimum the recent slowing in growth was quite limited and also suggest momentum may be starting to build again,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.He added that he thought markets were starting to realise they had overreacted to the European sovereign debt crisis and that this had unduly hit confidence in the US economy, contributing to the weak economic data seen in August.The second-quarter growth rate was revised up slightly to 1.7 per cent from a previous estimate of 1.6 per cent. Economists had forecast it would remain at 1.6 per cent.Investors looked to regional economic activity reports due to be released later in the session as precursors to the national surveys due out on Friday.The Chicago Purchasing Manager’s index increased to 60.4 from 56.7 in August, significantly above the consensus forecast for a decline to 55.5.The Institute of Supply Management’s report on the New York region showed business activity in New York City rose in September for the first time in four months.But shares later gave up gains, with nine of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 nudging lower.The energy sector was the only riser as it followed the oil price up. The S&P 500 energy index nudged up 0.1 per cent with ExxonMobil gaining 0.3 per cent to $61.79.The S&P 500 financials index fell 0.3 per cent even though AIG advanced 4.4 per cent to $39.10.The bailed out insurer agreed to sell two Japanese life assurance divisions to Prudential Financial for $4.8bn. Shares in the Prudential fell 4.2 per cent to $54.18.AIG also agreed a plan with the US government on how to repay the money given to it to prevent its collapse. About $49.1bn of the government’s holdings will be converted into common shares and sold – diluting the stake of common shareholders from about 20 per cent to about 7.9 per cent.Financials were in focus as Fed chairman Ben Bernanke testified before a Senate Banking Committee on how to implement the recently passed financial regulation laws.Morgan Stanley advanced 0.8 per cent to $24.68 and Zions Bancorp added 1.4 per cent to $21.36.In deals news, Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group edged up 0.1 per cent to $50.09 after investors rejected a $1.46bn takeover offer from Hertz Global Holdings, which dropped 8.8 per cent to $10.59.Avis Budget Group had raised its $1.53bn offer to include a break-up fee. Shares in Avis rose 1.1 per cent to $11.65.Elsewhere, VeriFone Systems, which provides electronic payment technology, bid for Hypercom, which provides similar services. Shares in Hypercom soared 53.7 per cent to $6.50 after the offer of $5.25 a share in cash. VeriFone rose 7 per cent to $31.07.
94;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-09-21T23:02:34Z;AIG resurrects plan to sell insurance groups;;AIG has resurrected a plan to sell two Japanese life insurance companies to Prudential Financial of the US and is close to agreeing a deal that would help repay taxpayer funds used to save the the beleaguered US insurer.People familiar with the matter said that Prudential Financial could pay more than $4bn for AIG Star Life Insurance and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co, after more than a year of talks.In what could be a complex deal, the net consideration to AIG could be less than that figure, they added.Negotiations between the two have in the past focused on the regulatory capital required for the businesses as well as the quality of some of the Star-Edison assets, such as their investment portfolios.While a deal could be announced within the next few days, last-minute disagreements could yet derail an announcement, those people warned.AIG and Prudential Financial declined to comment on the deal, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.A deal would leave AIG with little presence in Japan, with the US insurer having sold Alico, its Japan-centred life insurance business, earlier this year to MetLife for $15.5bn.The company is pressing ahead with plans for a listing of AIA, the Asian business whose $35bn sale to the UK’s Prudential collapsed earlier this year.A successful sale of Star-Edison would be another small step for AIG in repaying about $80bn debts to the US Treasury and Federal Reserve. The insurer last month sold most of its consumer finance unit, known as American General Finance, to Fortress Investment Group for a small fraction of its book value.

Potash, the world’s largest fertiliser producer, described the proposal as “grossly inadequate”.“There’s nothing like a headline-grabbing takeover bid to get the “animal spirits” back up,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.“Its odd because it is an Australian company going after a Canadian company but …it is that kind of potential deal which drives home the fact that companies have cash, that there is value and that there’s going to be growth globally.”US-listed Potash shares soared 27.7 per cent to $143.17, with US-listed shares of BHP Billiton falling 2.4 per cent to $70.21.Data showing production in the US rose more than expected in July pushed up shares in the materials and industrials sectors. Production climbed 1 per cent – more than double the average forecast.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, with commodity stocks adding to Monday’s gains. Alcoa advanced 3.3 per cent to $10.95 and Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4 per cent to $62.87.The industrials sector was up 1.8 per cent with Honeywell rising 2.9 per cent to $42.39 and Caterpillar climbing 1.8 per cent to $69.74.But investors shrugged off weaker than expected housing data with the S&P 500 homebuilders index rising 2.6 per cent, after falling 1.1 per cent on Monday on the back of a report showing housebuilder confidence fell.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.8 per cent after bellwether chains reported better than expected results and raised profit forecasts.Walmart rose 1.2 per cent to $51.02 after it posted a better than expected quarterly profit of 97 cents a share for the second quarter. On average, analysts had forecast profit of 96 cents a share. The company also raised its forecast for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05 a share from a previous projection of $3.90 to $4 on the back of cost cuts and international growth.But the world’s largest retailer said sales at US stores open for more than a year fell and warned that the consumer remained cautious.Home Depot also beat analysts’ estimates but sales missed expectations. Second-quarter earnings per share were 72 cents compared with the consensus forecast of 71 cents but sales missed forecasts.In contrast to competitor Lowe’s which said on Monday that full-year profit would come in below some analysts’ expectations, Home Depot raised its profit forecast. It said cost-cutting would boost profits but the home improvement chain also cut its sales forecast. Shares rose 3.4 per cent to $28.31.Fashion chains Urban Outfitters and Abercrombie & Fitch joined the list of retailers beating expectations.Urban Outfitters, reporting after the closing bell on Monday, said sales jumped 20 per cent in the last quarter, 7 per cent at stores open at least a year. Less discounting boosted margins and second-quarter profit rose 46 per cent. Shares rose 5.1 per cent to $32.95.But preppy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch fell 6.9 per cent to $35.05 in spite of reporting better than expected second-quarter profit as discounts damaged profits and concerns about a rise in inventories weighed on the shares.TJX, the owner of retail chains including TJMaxx, rose 1 per cent to $41.78 after reporting a rise in profit as customers continued to flock to buy its discount designer brands.Saks, luxury retail chain, rose 2.6 per cent to $7.81 after reporting a second-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts estimated.

98;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;New social impact tool to aid investing;;Investors wanting to use their money to have a positive social impact will soon have a new tool to help their investment process.A group of US public and private organisations will give $6.5m (£4.2m, €4.9m) to fund the development of the Global Impact Investment Rating System, broadening its geographical reach and creating a fund rating system on top of its extant company ratings. The group includes USAID, Prudential Financial, Deloitte and the Rockefeller Foundation.The concept of GIIRS goes beyond the idea of sustainable investment to ask whether investee companies are having a positive environmental and social impact. The impact investing sector is tiny, with around $50bn in assets, but proponents are optimistic the development of formal ratings will help it grow rapidly.“A lot of capital is being kept on the sidelines by the lack of a useful tool,” said Andrew Kassoy, co-founder of B-Lab, which has been building GIIRS.The new funding will support 12 private equity and venture capital funds investing in the developing world in encouraging their investee companies to apply for the ratings. A further 12 funds in developed markets are expected to join them.There are currently no plans to extend GIIRS to publicly listed equities, said Mr Kassoy, even though “a lot of investors have said to us ‘how can we apply this to public portfolios?’”

100;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-03-04T20:10:15Z;Insurance: A premium to pay;Insurance: A premium to pay;"Tidjane Thiam emerged into the deep cold of downtown Manhattan late last Friday certain of only one thing: Prudential, the UK insurance company he had run for just five months, had at least been accepted as a solid suitor.Directors of AIG, the stricken US insurer, and representatives of its most important shareholder, the American taxpayer, would not decide in favour of the Pru’s audacious and secretive $35.5bn (€26bn, £23.5bn) bid for AIA, its highly prized Asian business, for another 24 hours at least.AIG’s 11-strong board and its government minders – Sarah Dahlgren from the New York Federal Reserve and Jim Millstein, a former Lazard banker drafted in to manage the government’s stake in AIG as well as General Motors and Chrysler – had been impressed but it still was not a done deal.Mr Thiam, a former McKinsey consultant who once served in the government of his native Ivory Coast, had offered some of the charm that made him a hit with the Americans. “It seems that every time I have a meeting on this deal I bring a snowstorm with me,” he quipped to the AIG board as the flakes fell thickly outside. Weeks earlier, he had found himself stranded in Washington because of the snow after a meeting with Mr Millstein.His apparently relaxed tone belied the transformatory nature of the huge deal he was there to pitch. The Pru (which is unrelated to Prudential Financial of the US) has been making Asia an increasingly large and important part of its business for well over a decade. Buying AIA would take the share of its profits that come from the region from less than half to almost 90 per cent, while more than doubling the size of the company.For AIG, which the mercurial Hank Greenberg had turned into the world’s largest insurance group before being ousted five years ago, the Asian business was a jewel in the crown. The group would never have considered selling its ticket to the fastest-growing life assurance markets in the world if it were not for its near-collapse in 2008, when the financial crisis exposed the huge risks it had taken on through credit derivatives.But aside from the Pru’s approach, AIG had its bird-in-the-hand: a long-planned $10bn-$20bn Hong Kong listing of AIA. The pressure within the group’s board, especially among its special committee that had been overseeing the initial public offering, to stick to its original plan was intense right up until the last minute.It was only after that meeting last Friday that the board, the Fed and the Treasury “believed we had the money,” says an adviser on the British approach. One person present on the AIG side says: “It was the first time we had two really good choices, as opposed to lesser of evils, and everybody felt that way – everybody felt it was a close call, because they were both really good choices.”Back in late 2008, an AIG executive recalls, “the plan was to execute the fire-sale of a century” – a quick, cut-price, divestment of most of the once-mighty company’s large businesses. But with capital markets frozen, buyers were hard to come by. So work began on the Asian IPO.As those preparatory efforts approached completion late last year, news of a confidential filing for a flotation in Hong Kong was leaked to the press. That was meant as a signal to one man: Mr Thiam, whom a handful of people connected to AIG wanted to ensure was at the table as an alternative.The talks that ensued on AIA were complicated by its parent’s status as a ward of the state. With the US Treasury and New York Fed holding a combined stake of 80 per cent in AIG – and standing to receive the bulk of the proceeds from either a sale or IPO – its directors were under pressure to ensure that whatever deal they chose to pursue, it would not be derailed.“The board had to contend with a risk that is uncommon among American companies: the risk of being dragged in front of Congress and being roasted for doing a bad deal,” quips an adviser to AIG.Elsewhere in New York and thousands of miles away in Hong Kong and London last weekend, few among the legions of bankers working on AIA’s share sale suspected there was even a halfway serious alternative until news of the talks broke last Saturday. “There are hundreds of us who worked on this listing and put our heart and souls into it,” says one dealmaker. “We are devastated.”The Pru talks had to be kept secret. Any leaks at that stage would have both destabilised the IPO and put pressure on the Pru’s share price. This could have closed both routes to delivering the cash the Fed and Treasury wanted.The big question was over the Pru’s ability to finance a deal. Credit Suisse, its lead adviser, handed over a gutsy letter vouching for its own and the Pru’s ability to raise the funds early in the process. But AIG and its government handlers insisted that the Pru turned up to the Friday meeting with the group chief executives of Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase, which had been brought into the bid only a week before.In AIG’s jazz-era headquarters on Pine Street, the meeting turned out to be long and arduous. Mr Thiam, flanked by Brady Dougan of Credit Suisse and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, presented the Pru’s plans and its strengths. Each bank chief spoke in support of the Pru’s and their own institutions’ ability to execute the deal. There were questions all the way through, according to some of those present. “This was a complex deal, a very large deal and there are lots of interested parties,” says one adviser.The AIG side had to do a significant amount of reverse diligence on the Pru – after all, the rescued US group were about to take an 11 per cent stake in the combined Pru-AIA. Goldman and Citigroup had been quietly pulled out of the Asian IPO to advise AIG on the Pru only a week before that Friday meeting.But nothing was settled. AIG’s board gathered the next day for not one but two meetings, culminating at midnight on Saturday, by which time news of the talks had leaked.Although most of AIG’s directors had been chosen by or at least approved by the government, the debate over the AIA deal was lively. Even after Mr Thiam’s presentation – and the decision of Robert Benmosche, AIG chief executive, to back a sale – many on the AIG board favoured an IPO. Not until Sunday did Mr Benmosche carry the day.The proposed purchase is a big vote of confidence in Mr Thiam by AIG and the US government, one banker says. But it is not yet a done deal. In the first two days of this week, the Pru’s share price dropped almost 20 per cent, suggesting investor concern over the size of the gamble.The offer was the culmination of three months of top-secret and increasingly intense work by just a handful of people. The insiders were Mr Benmosche at AIG and a couple of corporate strategists led by Brian Schreiber; Mr Thiam at the Pru and Nic Nicandrou, chief financial officer, who himself had joined only at the end of October. There were just four senior bankers at Credit Suisse on the deal: Sebastian Grigg, George Maddison, Chris Williams and James Leigh-Pemberton. Mr Millstein represented the government.The first serious contact, according to people familiar with the situation, came last November. As most other executives and bankers were taking a Thanksgiving break from the frantic months that had followed the global crisis, Mr Thiam and Credit Suisse made contact with Mr Benmosche.To Credit Suisse executives such as Mr Dougan, Mr Benmosche was a known quantity. During seven years on Credit Suisse’s board that ended only last August, the AIG chief had had plenty of opportunities to display his no-nonsense approach, penchant for direct language and tendency to tackle thorny issues head-on. The trust between AIG and Credit Suisse meant its small team could work on the deal even though they had colleagues working on AIA’s Hong Kong listing alongside the other banks.The level of secrecy meant that those few bankers had to do all the work involved in preparing, updating and selling the pitch. “It was all very tiring because we had to work like youngsters again,” says one.Eventually, the Pru team gained enough of the AIG board’s confidence that they were given access to AIA’s IPO data room. This meant they could carry out due diligence on AIA – codenamed “Red”, with the Pru called “Prince” – without the target being aware. “Prince” came up with an indicative offer in late January, but that was “billions” of dollars short of AIG’s $35.5bn asking price, according to people involved.While the AIG side was impressed with Mr Thiam and respected the Pru, executives were mindful that a big piece of their own organisation – cheered on by underwriters at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank – was primed for an IPO. But whatever excitement the underwriters were trying to generate, the market conditions in Asia were dampening enthusiasm for the IPO and causing some concern at AIG.The Hong Kong market was wobbling and, worse, the list of potential IPOs was being swollen by the recognition that a number of large regional Chinese banks were undercapitalised and needed to raise funds. “Instead of AIA being the only big financial name that was proposing to get listed and do an IPO in Hong Kong in 2010, it very quickly started to look like JFK [airport] on a crowded afternoon and there were financial institutions all over Asia lining up around Hong Kong to try to get into the market in 2010,” says someone on the AIG side.A number of the investors lined up for the IPO are instead said to be keen to help underwrite a $20bn rights issue the Pru needs to fund the deal.Mr Thiam’s keenness belies one of the two great ironies in this tale. A senior Pru insider insists it was Mr Thiam who had quashed the company’s first tilt at buying AIA in 2009. He is said to have worked tirelessly to convince the Pru board, some large shareholders and his predecessor, Mark Tucker, that AIA needed cleaning up both on the accounting side and the asset side before a deal could be considered.Now, the Americans “have cleaned this up, they’ve sold the toxic assets, because the Fed had their name attached to this”, says the insiderThe other irony concerns what might have happened if the AIG board had plumped for the IPO instead. Bankers involved with AIA say that a regular feature of its meetings with Asian investors to sell the Hong Kong listing was AIA management’s talk that it would look at launching a bid for the Pru as soon as it had its own capital to play with. One Asian dealmaker says that for the Pru it was a question of acting to save its skin: “While it is a high-risk decision [to bid], the Pru did not really have a choice but to try and acquire AIA – or risk the tables being turned.”“Tidjane has been extraordinarily brave,” says an adviser. “It is not easy to take over as the chief executive of a very large life company and very quickly double down on your bet.”A very senior executive at a rival insurance company says that if Mr Thiam fails to raise the money for this deal, everyone else will be very nervous. “There’s no one else who can put the cash on the table to do this deal,” the executive says. “If he wins, he will be the king – if he fails, well, maybe he will go back to McKinsey.”Additional reporting by Kate Burgess and Sundeep Tucker"
101;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

104;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-01-21T00:17:52Z;SEC litigation release for General Re;;"Litigation Release No. 21384 / January 20, 2010Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3108 / January 20, 2010Securities and Exchange Commission v. General Re Corporation, Civil Action No. 10 Civ 458 (S.D.N.Y.)SEC Charges General Re Corporation for Role in AIG and Prudential Accounting FraudsThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged General Re Corporation for its involvement in separate schemes by American International Group and Prudential Financial, Inc. to manipulate and falsify their reported financial results.The complaint alleges that a foreign subsidiary of Gen Re entered into two sham “reinsurance” transactions with AIG in 2000 to improperly allow AIG to reverse the declining reserve trend and falsely report additions to both loss reserves and premiums written. Senior officials at Gen Re helped AIG structure the two sham transactions. The contracts show reinsurance transactions that appeared to transfer risk to AIG, but the transactions did not transfer risk.The complaint further alleges that Gen Re separately entered into a series of sham reinsurance contracts with Prudential’s property and casualty division from 1997 to 2002. The contracts had no economic substance and purpose other than to allow Prudential to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset or “finite bank” parked with Gen Re. As a result of the sham transactions, Prudential improperly recognized more than $200 million in revenues in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Gen Re received fees totaling $8.1 million for structuring and executing the scheme with Prudential.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gen Re has consented to a judgment enjoining it from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and directing it to pay $12.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.In determining to accept Gen Re’s settlement offer, the SEC took Gen Re’s remediation efforts and cooperation into account. Among the efforts SEC considered: Gen Re’s comprehensive, independent review of its operations conducted at the outset of the government’s investigations the results of which were shared with investigators; Gen Re’s substantial assistance in the government’s successful civil and criminal actions against individuals involved in the scheme with AIG; and Gen Re’s internal corporate reforms designed to strengthen oversight of its operations. Those reforms entail dissolving a subsidiary involved with the AIG transactions, appointing an independent director to its Board of Directors, forming a committee consisting of senior managers to review and approve complex transactions, requiring legal review of proposed finite or loss mitigation contracts, and fortifying its internal audit functions and underwriting rules.The SEC previously charged AIG with securities fraud and improper accounting, and the company settled the charges by paying more than $800 million among other remedies. The SEC also previously charged AIG former chairman Maurice R. “Hank” Greenberg and former chief financial officer Howard I. Smith, as well as former senior executives of Gen Re for their roles in connection with the scheme with AIG. The Commission separately charged Prudential with securities laws violations in 2008."
105;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2010-01-21T00:07:46Z;General Re fined $92m for alleged sham sales;;General Re, a division of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, has agreed to pay more than $92m to settle allegations related to sham transactions with insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial.The company will pay $19.5m to the US Postal Inspection Service Consumer Fraud Fund and $12.2m to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators said on Wednesday.It also agreed to pay $60.5m to AIG’s shareholders.“Gen Re arranged to sell financial products to AIG and Prudential for the sole purpose of enabling those companies to manipulate their accounting results,” said Andrew Calamari, associate director of the SEC‘s New York office.Wednesday’s settlements allow the reinsurance group to avoid criminal prosecution.Gen Re, which neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in its SEC settlement, previously forfeited about $5m in fees to the government over the AIG scheme.The SEC claimed that Gen Re engaged in two sham reinsurance transactions to make it look as though AIG had increased its loss reserves in the final quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 by $500m.Gen Re also allegedly entered into sham contracts with Prudential’s property and casualty division that allowed Prudential to improperly recognise more than $200m in revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002.In 2006, the SEC charged AIG with securities fraud and improper accounting.The company settled by paying more than $800m without admitting wrongdoing.An AIG spokesman could not be reached.The commission charged Prudential with financial reporting violations in 2008.Prudential said there was no finding of fraud and it had settled without paying penalties.As part of the resolution with the Justice Department announced on Wednesday, prosecutors said Gen Re admitted that its most senior management engaged in a scheme to falsely inflate AIG’s reported loss reserves.Five people have been convicted of criminal fraud for AIG’s transactions with Gen Re.In 2008, a US court determined that AIG’s shareholders lost between $544m and $597m because of the scheme.Attorneys representing Gen Re were not immediately available for comment.Regulators noted that Gen Re conducted an independent review of its operations and cooperated with prosecutors and the SEC.
106;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Prudential to pick buyers for S Korean units;;Prudential Financial, the second-largest US life insurer, plans to select a preferred bidder for its two South Korean units by the end of this month in a deal estimated at up to Won1,000bn ($890m).Up to five potential buyers including KB Financial Group and Hanwha Group have submitted their bids to acquire Prudential Investment & Securities and its asset management affiliate, an executive at Prudential’s Seoul office said on Tuesday. .“If possible, we want to sell the two units as a package but if not, we will sell the brokerage unit first,” said the executive. He estimated the value of the two units at between Won500bn and Won1,000bn.The sale underscores the mounting challenges foreign fund managers face in South Korea’s $300bn funds market, where only a few global – players such as Fidelity Investments and Schroders – have made profits with offshore funds.Prudential bought the former Hyundai units from the South Korean government for Won355.5bn in 2004 to strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region’s fifth-largest economy.But it failed to expand the businesses in the country, partly because of a passive management strategy that focused on bond investments. Prudential Investment, with Won420bn in capital, suffered a Won11bn net loss in the fiscal year 2008 ended March.The sale of the two companies will leave the US insurer with only life insurance business in South Korea.Credit Suisse withdrew from an asset management joint venture in South Korea last year as it struggled to compete with domestic giants such as Mirae Asset and Samsung Investment Trust Management. Many foreign fund houses including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and AllianceBernstein suffered losses in South Korea in the first half of last year ended September.Hanwha Securities said on Tuesday it was conducting due diligence on the Prudential units and might consider a rights offering to fund the acquisition.But its shares plunged 7.1 per cent to Won9,520 on Tuesday on analysts’ concerns about financing and a lack of synergies. Its parent Hanwha Group withdrew from a race to take over Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering last year because of funding difficulties.KB Financial on Tuesday said it had joined the race for the Prudential companies. The country’s largest retail financial group is keen to expand into the non-banking sector by acquiring a broker or an insurer.Securities groups have become attractive acquisition targets in South Korea because they are allowed to engage in diverse businesses after the country’s new financial regulations aimed at deregulation took effect last year.

After rising in early trading, Pfizer shares finished 0.3 per cent lower at $18.55.Elsewhere in the sector, Achillion rose 15.1 per cent to $3.66 after Roth Capital initiated coverage of the pharmaceuticals company with a “buy” rating and price target of $12.Last week, Achillion announced positive results from a trial of its hepatitis C drug.The S&P 500 rallied to a fresh 2009 closing high, after Citigroup announced it had repaid $20bn in bailout money to the US government.The S&P 500 ended 0.2 per cent higher at 1,120.59, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,269.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,466.44.The market shrugged off negative data released earlier in the day. Sales of new homes in the US fell 11.3 per cent month-over-month in November, a steeper drop than predicted. Separately, the US Department of Commerce reported consumer spending was up just 0.5 per cent, compared with 0.6 per cent in October.In spite of the mixed data, technology stocks made gains. “The tech sector has held up very well, particularly the semiconductors, and that has been a good sign for the overall market,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “It’s an indication that global growth is sustainable.”Micron Technology was up 6.2 per cent to $9.99 after posting its first profit in more than two years.The memory chipmaker reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $204m compared with a loss of $718m a year earlier as the company benefited from increased demand for computer and mobile devices.SanDisk added 3.1 per cent to $28.28 after ThinkEquity upgraded it from “hold” to “buy”, with a $35 price target. The brokerage said SanDisk was poised for a strong 2010 because of improved pricing trends and pared-down inventories.Yahoo was 4.3 per cent higher at $16.67 after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the internet search engine company.The brokerage rated Yahoo as “overweight” and said the company was starting to see growth in usage following a redesign of its homepage.Yahoo announced on Tuesday that it would cut costs by shutting down most of its operations for the week between Christmas and the new year, although consumers will not see any difference on its website.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Tibco Software climbed 7.7 per cent to $9.76. Although Tibco’s fourth-quarter profit declined 1.7 per cent to $31.7m, licensing revenue rose 4.7 per cent.Cintas, the largest US uniforms supplier, plunged 11.5 per cent to $26.27 after reporting a lower-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profit. Net income rose 5.9 per cent to $57.2m as the group continued to suffer from weak demand.Home Depot was lower following the disappointing figures for sales of new home.

108;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-12-17T08:16:48Z;China Pacific Insurance raises $3.1bn;;China Pacific Insurance, the country’s third-largest insurer, has raised $3.1bn in a Hong Kong initial public offering that paves the way for US private equity group Carlyle to eventually sell down its stake and book a nearly five-fold profit on its original investment.In the world’s seventh-largest IPO this year, China Pacific sold 861.3m shares, or a 10.2 per cent stake, at HK$28 (US$3.6) per share, according to people familiar with the deal.Carlyle and US-based Prudential Financial first bought 25 per cent of the life insurance arm of China Pacific for around $410m at the end of 2005 with Carlyle taking the majority of the stake.Then in 2007 Carlyle increased its investment and converted it into a 17 per cent stake in the parent, China Pacific Group, before the insurer went public on the Shanghai stock exchange at the end of that year.Thanks partly to Chinese capital controls and foreign investment regulations Carlyle was not allowed to sell its stake in the market in Shanghai.Carlyle’s total investment was around $800m for a stake that is now worth around $4.7bn, based on the Hong Kong IPO price, giving Carlyle a return of nearly six times its original investment.But the private equity group has not sold any shares in the Hong Kong IPO and is subject to a one-year lockup period before it can begin to realise its gains.“Carlyle is not rushing for the door and is not planning to sell out any time soon,” according to a person close to the deal.Carlyle is the second biggest shareholder in China Pacific after Baosteel, the state-owned steel conglomerate. Another large investor is Shenergy, an energy company owned by the Shanghai government.Despite the lucrative paper returns Carlyle is wary of harming its relations with the Chinese government by exiting the investment too quickly.The original investment in 2005 came at a time when state-controlled China Pacific was close to bankruptcy, according to people involved in the deal. In the first three quarters of this year China Pacific made more than Rmb4bn in profit, an increase of around 200 per cent from the same period a year earlier.The company’s shares have risen more than 130 per cent this year, beating the 80 per cent rise in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index.Analysts said the deal is a huge coup for a foreign private equity group that has had its share of deals turn sour in the unpredictable Chinese market, where the government has stepped in on a number of occasions to block deals it found politically unpalatable.The biggest investor in China Pacific’s IPO was Hopu Investment Management, the Beijing based investment fund, which invested $430m according to people familiar with the matter.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.

Its shares fell 21.6 per cent to 98 cents.The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw the sharpest rise, supported by encouraging earnings from several of its component companies.Drugmaker Merck was a strong performer after it beat expectations, helped by a lower effective tax rate and tight cost controls. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $29.65.Shares in Schering-Plough, the smaller rival Merck has agreed to buy, gained 3.8 per cent to $26.53 after net income jumped 45 per cent on strong sales of an anti-allergy inhaler and arthritis treatment, helping it to beat expectations.DuPont, the chemical maker, also saw cost controls help negate weaker revenues but the shares slipped a fraction to $28.32.The company’s corn and soybean sales improved in its agricultural unit, and that was enough to give a jolt to shares in Monsanto, the market leader in that field, which picked up 4.6 per cent to $80.08.The Dow closed 0.8 per cent up at 8,915.94, while the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index both rose 0.4 per cent to 954.58 and 1,916.20, respectively.Both the S&P and Nasdaq were at new closing highs for the year.Not every Dow component impressed with its earnings, however. Coca-Cola lost 1.3 per cent to $50.35 even after beating estimates as investors focused on disappointing revenues.United Technologies fell sharply after the company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, with demand for its building and aircraft equipment remaining low. The shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $53.97.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, as Regions Financial reported a wider loss than expected, with mounting losses on commercial and real estate taking their toll on the bank. The shares lost 15.4 per cent to $3.42.BlackRock, the asset manager poised to buy Barclays Global Investors, also fell, dropping 0.4 per cent to $184.14 even after it saw profits beat expectations.Meanwhile, profits at UnitedHealth jumped after higher unemployment led more customers to sign up for its government-backed Medicare insurance plans. Its shares were 3 per cent higher at $25.59.Elsewhere, NRG suddenly jumped during the morning after shareholders in effect ended a $7.7bn hostile bid from rival Exelon by rejecting its nominations for NRG’s board. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $24.82.
111;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-06-30T01:22:40Z;State Street mutual fund could face charges;;State Street disclosed on Monday that it had received a “Wells notice” from the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating that the US regulator was preparing to bring charges against the custodial bank’s mutual fund operation for its foray into risky mortgage-backed bonds in 2007 and before.The SEC’s notice is the latest in a series of probes into whether State Street adequately disclosed to investors the risks associated with funds invested in bonds backed by subprime mortgages.William Galvin, Massachusetts’ top securities regulator, said in April that he was looking into State Street’s disclosures surrounding investments made by pension funds.Prudential Financial filed a suit against State Street in October 2007, seeking $80m to recoup losses sustained when two of the bank’s funds plunged in value with the collapse of the real estate bubble.One of the funds at issue is State Street’s Limited Duration Bond Fund, which was promoted to investors as an “enhanced cash” vehicle, designed to enhance the stability of rock solid investments with greater returns but without significantly adding risk.During the summer of 2007, the $1.4bn fund lost 37 per cent of its value, according to the Boston Globe. That sparked a lawsuit filed by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, based in Dubuque, Iowa, which claimed it had lost $1m on the investment.In January 2008, William Hunt, head of State Street Global Advisors, stepped down.The bank also announced that it had set aside $625m to settle litigation arising from the implosion of the “enhanced cash” fund and other funds.In February of this year, State Street announced that it had paid $417m in settlements involving the funds.The fact that the SEC has issued a “Wells notice”, which allows State Street one last opportunity to dissuade members of the SEC’s enforcement division from seeking permission from the agency’s five commissioners to take action, suggests State Street is reluctant to cut a deal with the agency, says Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities.“Two years after the fact, the SEC has concluded that State Street should be fined for improper sales practices”, says Mr Bove. “It appears they’ll go to court”.Mr Bove does not think the SEC’s action will have a significant impact on State Street’s business, which rebounded from the bad publicity surrounding the funds’ plunge in value two years ago.
112;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-06-15T21:29:09Z;Lincoln reduces its bail-out needs;;Lincoln Financial will draw less than half of the US bail-out money it has approval for after selling a UK life assurance business for more than $300m to Canada’s Sun Life and announcing plans to raise $1.4bn in stock and bond sales.Lincoln expects to draw $950m from the troubled asset relief programme, much less than the $2.5bn in capital injections it was offered.The company is only the second US life assurer to take bail-out cash. The Hartford Financial Group said on Friday it would take its full $3.4bn allowance.Six big US life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries gained approval to receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds in May, after concerns grew about the financial stability of the sector.However, four of these groups turned down the funds after raising capital through other routes – Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Allstate and Ameriprise Financial.The US life industry has been hard hit by a combination of tumbling stock and bond markets, which have hurt the value of investments, and the high cost of making good on guarantees promised to individual policyholders in variable annuity products.These are long-term savings products where the consumer is able to reap some of the benefit from rising investment values, but is protected against steep declines.Lincoln said on Monday that it intended to pay $1bn of the proceeds of its capital-raising exercise into its principal insurance unit, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, and keep the remaining $1bn for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt.“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital,” Lincoln said.The company will issue $600m of new shares in a public underwritten offering and up to $500m of senior debt.The sale of its Lincoln National UK life insurance operations to Sun Life Financial of Canada has already secured about $320m in its capital raising efforts.Both the Sun Life and Lincoln National operations in the UK are in effect closed books of life assurance business, which means they sell few new policies.However, such businesses can still generate strong cash flows, which has attracted some colourful entrepreneurs to the sector in the UK to buy up such businesses.Sun Life said the deal would increase its UK assets under management by about 60 per cent to £10.6bn ($17.2bn) and add between C$0.08 and C$0.10 to earnings next year.“The combined operation is expected to generate attractive returns and serve to position Sun Life for future growth in one of the world’s largest life insurance markets,” said Donald Stewart, Sun Life chief executive.
113;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-05-16T01:43:12Z;Life assurers to receive bail-out cash;;Life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries will receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds, officials confirmed on Friday, a move experts hope will damp concerns about the financial stability of this sector.Six companies have been approved for capital injections: Hartford Financial Services, Prudential, Allstate, Ameriprise, Lincoln National and Principal Financial, although Ameriprise turned down the money on Friday. Officials said the insurance groups could receive much of the $22bn (£15bn) remaining in the capital purchase programme, part of the wider $700bn troubled asset relief programme, but cautioned that not all the money would necessarily go to them.“This has the potential to be a meaningful, material contribution to capital for certain companies,” said Kevin Ahern, an analyst at Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency.The companies eligible for bail-out funds all own or have recently acquired banks. They applied for capital months ago and received approval through the normal process for bank recapitalisation. Nonetheless, the capital injections, which can be used to support their insurance operations as well, come as policymakers are paying increasing attention to risks emanating from the life assurance sector, as well as property and casualty insurers and pension funds.Officials have no specific or immediate cause for concern. But while they think they have a very good handle on risks within the banking system following the stress test of the top 19 US banks, they are less confident that they have identified all the dangers within the insurance and pension industries.Insurance groups are regulated state-by-state by 51 regulators, meaning that federal authorities do not have as good a line of sight into their operations as they do with the biggest banks.Moreover, they operate under actuarial principles that allow them to smooth their operating performance and do not need to mark all their assets to their current market values – practices that make them less vulnerable in the short term to market disruptions but also mean that problems may take longer to come to the surface.Opinions differ on how opaque these groups are. Matt Carroll, a second analyst at S&P, said there was “pretty good visibility in real time on both the asset side and liabilities side”.Nonetheless, a number of policymakers believe that if there is a further relapse in the financial system, it is more likely to be caused by problems at the insurers than at the banks.Many life assurance groups issued a lot of annuities that offered clients the better of a fixed return or a rise in the stock market. Analysts suspect that some of these were imperfectly hedged. Meanwhile, life assurance groups – and other insurers, as well as pension funds – face losses on their portfolios of commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate whole loans and corporate bonds.In a report published in February, S&P said the economic downturn would put “unprecedented stress” on these portfolios. Since then, analysts have become even more concerned about commercial real estate loans in particular.Lower credit ratings and counterparty concerns in turn have raised the cost of financing for life insurers and made it harder for them to raise capital if needed to shore up their finances.The rally in the stock market since its March lows has provided a strong boost to life assurance companies, other insurers and pension funds. But concerns about asset quality remain.Life assurers are historically very stable, with predictable outgoings and a strong cash flow from the sale of new business. However, in theory at least, they could be vulnerable in extremis either to a funding crisis or to a fear-induced rush to cash out policies with surrender values early.Life assurers do not have access to Federal Reserve liquidity, though their banking subsidiaries do.With defined-benefit pension funds, meanwhile, the main danger is that large accumulated losses could create a need for large top-up payments from the sponsoring companies. That would put a drag on profits, in effect forcing an increase in corporate saving that is likely to come at the expense of some investment, sapping growth. Losses on defined contribution plans fall directly on households.In depth: US banks
114;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-05-11T20:29:46Z;Bank stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks fell on Monday, giving back almost all the gains made on Friday in the wake of the government’s stress test results.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would issue shares to raise capital to pay off government bail-out funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies said on Monday that they would raise money to free themselves from government restrictions.Capital One said it would sell 56m common shares and its stock fell 13.5 per cent to $27.10. US Bancorp said it wanted $2.5bn from its issuance, sending its shares 9.9 per cent lower to $18.50.BB&T said it would use the additional $1.5bn it planned to raise also to boost tier one capital, an effort supported by a deep cut in its dividend. The company fell 7.6 per cent to $24.34.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend indicated the banks may need less capital than estimated if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo lost ground after it said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit with earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday. Its shares avoided the worst of the selling but slipped 5.9 per cent to $26.53.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 7.6 per cent to $26.07, even though Bank of America said its shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Prudential, the life assurer, was a particularly heavy faller after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral”, slashing its price target. Goldman upgraded the company just over two weeks ago, triggering a 10.8 per cent rise in its shares. They lost 12.3 per cent to $40.33 on Monday.Principal Financial, Prudential’s rival, also slumped after saying it would offer 42.3m shares, valued at over $1bn, in order to bolster its capital position. The shares lost 14.1 per cent to $20.34.Huntington Bancshares was one of the few financial companies to find gains as Bank of America said the company would start posting a profit in 2011. Its shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $5.71.The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 909.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 8,418.77.“If the S&P can get through the first half of this week without breaking through 900 it will be a win for the bulls,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM.The Nasdaq Composite index fell a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to 1,731.24, however, amid resilience from technology stocks.Microsoft lost 0.5 per cent to $19.32 after the company said it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-A credit rating. It has resisted taking on debt for years.“The fact that Microsoft is issuing debt suggests they must think the environment is pretty good and rates are going to be going up because the economy will improve,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Intel rallied ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company on allegations that it abused its dominant market position. Lawyers forecast that any potential fine could be one of the heaviest implemented in Europe but the stock edged 0.5 per cent higher to $15.37.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.4 per cent to $68 and ExxonMobil dropped 1.6 per cent to $69.27.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was one of the S&P’s biggest fallers after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”.

This built on its gains of the last week, during which its shares have jumped more than 50 per cent. The stock rose 1.5 per cent after the bell to $13.71.John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global said: “The market is getting more and more confident. People think this will be the last round of capital raising.”Regional banks were also major gainers, with Fifth Third surging 21.5 per cent to $6.50 in post-market trade as it said it would sell its processing unit to boost its balance sheet by $1.1bn.Mr Brady said: “Investors are looking beyond the immediate capital needs, but if the regional banks go back to the market in the third or fourth quarter the recourse will be rather dramatic.”Wells Fargo was one of the few fallers, as investors worried about how dilution following the banks’ announcement it would issue $6bn in common equity to pass the test. Its shares fell 0.2 per cent to $24.70.Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, told PBS, the broadcaster, that the results would be “reassuring” and that none of the tested banks was insolvent.But Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, knocked investors’ confidence when he when he suggested the tests might pave the way to a more interventionist attitude from government towards the banking sector.“Investors don’t know what role the government will play in who should and shouldn’t be CEO or board member at certain companies,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Asset Management.During normal trading hours, the market had given up some of their recent gains following a strong week as investors reacted to the first indications of how banks had fared in the test.There was also support for the sector from Prudential, the life assurer, which reported higher operating earnings than had been expected. Its shares leapt 20.5 per cent to $42.87.The sector took confidence from figures showing that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time last week was much lower than estimated, falling to 601,000.Meanwhile, those continuing to claim such benefits reached a record.But AT&T and Verizon, the telecommunications giants, weighed on the indices after they were downgraded by JPMorgan, which said it was more cautious about the companies’ wireless businesses.AT&T lost 4.7 per cent to $25.45 while Verizon fell 2.9 per cent to $29.86.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 907.39 while the Dow Jones fell 1.2 per cent to 8,409.85.Cisco proved a drag on the Nasdaq Composite as it reported falling profit. Its shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.95, even though its earnings beat estimates.The Nasdaq, which has started to slip following outperformance in the first quarter, lost 2.4 per cent to 1,716.24.The index was lowered by Symantec, which makes security software. The group fell 14.8 per cent to $14.99 after it said its first-quarter sales would miss analysts’ estimates, with customer orders remaining low.“The market seems to have rallied because people were covering short positions rather than conviction buying,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “But this is a traders’ market and traders know it is prudent to lock in profits, which is why we’re seeing falls today.”General Motors fell 3.6 per cent to $1.60 after it saw revenues slump and burned through more than $10bn in cash during the first quarter.Retailers performed well after more than a dozen companies raised their earnings guidance following stronger than expected sales in April.Target, the budget retailer, also found gains after the company said its first-quarter earnings would be much higher than estimates. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $42.67.Sara Lee added to the optimism over consumer behaviour after the household goods maker saw strength in the US, helping it offset weakness in its European businesses and outstrip analysts’ estimates with its first- quarter earnings. Its shares gained 4.4 per cent to $9.35.There was evidence that consumer activity was not as strong everywhere. JC Penney’s sales fell more than expected during April and its shares lost 5.7 per cent to $30.07.News Corp saw gains in spite of disappointing the market as it reported lower- than-expected profit, hit by steep falls in advertising across the company’s businesses.Investors took comfort from Rupert Murdoch, chairman, who said the worst was over for the economy. The group’s shares rose 1.1 per cent to $10.77.
116;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-04-01T20:53:38Z;Wall St buoyant on economic data;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday to take Wall Street towards its second consecutive session of gains as good economic data countered early fears about the state of the economy.Equities dropped steeply in the morning as figures showed that 742,000 jobs had been lost from the private sector during March, about 100,000 more than had been expected.But shares recovered and moved into positive territory after data from the Institute of Supply Management showed that manufacturing output and prices slowed their declines during March.That helped commodities stocks find gains after early losses triggered by falling commodity prices.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lifted 4.2 per cent to $39.71, while Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer gained 3.5 per cent to $7.60.Steel companies performed especially well, with US Steel lifting 7.1 per cent to $22.62 and AK Steel gaining 9.1 per cent to $7.77.The manufacturing data along with figures showing that mortgage applications had also risen, helped financial companies find gains.Citigroup rose 5.9 per cent to $2.68 and Bank of Americagained 3.4 per cent to $7.05.Investors were also keen to buy banks ahead of Wednesday’s announcement from the Financial Accounting Standards Board on mark-to-market accounting, which has been blamed for exacerbating banks’ capital problems.Insurers performed well, with Prudential gaining 7.8 per cent to $20.50, Lincoln National picking up 5.7 per cent to $7.07 and Metlife lifting 2.9 per cent to $23.43.Aflac was one of the only insurers to fall after S&P downgraded hybrid debt issued by more than 60 European firms. Aflac said in February that downgrades of such securities could force it to take more writedowns this year. Its shares lost 3.2 per cent to $18.75“The jobs data spooked the market, but there are now some indications that we are starting to see a levelling off of the economic slump,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.7 per cent to 811.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 2 per cent to 7,761.60 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,551.60.Telecoms were the biggest risers on the S&P, led higher by QWest which is considering selling its long haul network, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. With Verizon and AT&T said to be possible buyers, QWest’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $3.75.General Motors fell for a third consecutive session, however, weighed by further talk of bankruptcy, as the New York Times reported that the Obama administration was looking to lead the company into a “controlled” bankruptcy. GM’s shares lost 0.5 per cent to $1.93.But Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said that while the possible bankruptcy was not good news for GM shareholders, the increased certainty about the status of the company had helped calm the wider market.“There has been more clarity from Washington over automotives, and that is lending some stability to stocks,” he said.Healthcare stocks proved the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after Celgene the drug maker, warned about revenues coming in at the lower end of forecasts, saying it expected 2009 profits of about $2.05 per share. It lost 13.4 per cent to $38.47.Many investors were waiting for further news from the G20 meeting in London.Taro Aso, the Japanese prime minister, warned in an interview with the FT of the serious consequences of not agreeing another globally co-ordinated stimulus plan. But Mr Cardillo of Avalon said he believed that Wall Street would only move if there was a total breakdown of relations at the meeting.“The market is not going to hang its hat on the G20. Unless there’s an indication that protectionism might come into play the market will ignore it.”Apollo Group, the University of Phoenix’s parent company, fell in spite of better-than-expectesd quarterly earnings. Investors were spooked by warnings of slowing margin growth and of the university facing increased regulatory oversight. Its shares lost 15.2 per cent to $66.46.

Insurers Prudentialand Lincoln National rose 26.5 per cent to $21.11 and 32.7 per cent to $9.70 respectively, while State Street, the asset manager, gained 21.4 per cent to $29.97.“There is a lot more detail in Mr Geithner’s latest plan,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “Investors believe this plan, at least initially, is the most viable possible one for cleaning up the banks. The most serious problem will be the pricing of assets, but for now, the equities market is relieved just to see some detail.”But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “This is something that could have ended this much, much earlier, but now it’s just a mild positive.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 7.1 per cent up at 822.92 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.8 per cent to 7,775.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 6.8 per cent to 1,555.77 points.The last time the S&P gained as much was on the back of a cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve last year. Financial stocks staged their biggest rally since November.President Barack Obama also helped calm nerves on Wall Street when he sounded less than positive about a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Friday to impose a 90 per cent tax on the bonuses of high earners at bailed-out banks. Mr Obama said the government needed to find ways of reacting “that are both legal, that are constitutional”, fuelling hopes he may veto it if it passes the Senate.“The movement to tax the bonus of Tarp [troubled asset relief programme] players has put a cloud over the financial industry, and risks slowing the recovery of the financial sector and economy,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Energy stocks rose, following the oil price, which reached new highs for the year. Chevrongained 6.9 per cent to $69.15 and Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $70.53.Investors also took confidence from better figures on sales of existing homes in February. They had been expected to fall, but rose by 5 per cent on the previous month.Homebuilders were some of the best-performing stocks on the S&P. Lennar rose
20.4 per cent to $9.76, whileKB Homepicked up 15.4 per cent to $12.98.Steel companies helped the industrial sector rise more than most after Citi said macroeconomic conditions pointed to a better future. Citi wrote: “The manufacturing downturn is no longer accelerating at this point, and upside opportunity outweighs downside risk in our opinion.”Nucor, one of the country’s largest steelmakers, rose 7.3 per cent to $40.20, while AK Steel picked up 14.3 per cent to $7.90 and US Steelrose 12 per cent to $22.08.General Electric also boosted the sector after Moody’s cut its rating by two notches, but gave it a stable outlook. Investors
had expected worse and the company’s shares rose 9.3 per cent to $10.43.Intelrose 5.9 per cent to $15.52 after the company said it would overhaul its pay structure, with no rise to executives’ pay.There was also good news for consumer companies as luxury jeweller Tiffany gained 15.5 per cent to $23.37 after its earnings beat analysts’ expectations in spite of a 34 per cent fall in sales in its flagship Manhattan store for the past quarter.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, also beat expectations, with reduced profits coming from reorganisation costs rather than falling sales. Its shares advanced
9.4 per cent to $26.58."
118;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.
119;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-03-16T19:56:14Z;Wall St snaps four-day winning streak;;US stocks fell sharply in late trade, giving up previous gains to finish slightly below Friday’s close as American Express announced more people had trouble paying credit card bills in February.The news prompted a slump in the company’s shares, which finished 3.3 per cent down at $12.66. It also dragged down the financial sector, which had enjoyed an early banking-led rally.Shares in Citigroup surged back above $2, gaining 30.9 per cent to $2.33 as confidence in the banking sector continued to rise after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s leading banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.The sector was also given a boost when Barclays of the UK added its name to the big banks that have said they started the year well.Last week Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009.Bank of America rose 7.3 per cent to $6.18 but JPMorgan fell after American Express’ announcement, losing 2.8 per cent to $23.09.Financial companies were also helped by messages from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed changes to the mark-to-market accounting rule, which has been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.The board proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is “distressed” when measuring the value of an asset.Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 8.1 per cent to $19.17 and Prudential lifting 1.8 per cent to $19.10.Capital One provided some relief from American Express’ news after it announced reduced the numbers of auto loans it believes will never be repaid. Its shares gained 0.1 per cent to $12.57.But many investors still feel the recent rally by financial stocks is flimsy. Terry Morris, senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, said: “Citi’s rise is based on speculative buying that leads to short-covering. The company is not 40 per cent better than it was on Friday.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 753.89, having earlier been over 2 per cent higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 7,216.97.Weakness from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which lost 1.9 per cent to 1,404.02.Cisco announced on Monday it was to sell servers for data systems in partnership with smaller technology companies. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $15.45.Analysts said the deal might herald other large companies in the sector snapping up smaller rivals, but shares in many of those companies still fell as investors moved their money back into riskier sectors.Oracle, which was named specifically by Barron’s, the publication for investors, as a potential purchaser, was one of the biggest drags on the sector, losing 4.2 per cent to $14.90. Intel meanwhile fell 3.1 per cent to $14.25 and Dell dropped 5 per cent to $8.90.Investors had looked to the cash-rich technology sector as a defensive trade but as financials strengthened, it became the day’s biggest faller. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “People are coming back to the financial sector and seeing some recovery in healthcare stocks.”Industrial stocks were led higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected.Investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company and the company’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $9.66.Consol Energy rallied in spite of the falling price of oil, rising 5.5 per cent to $27.48 after Barron’s said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making it a bargain.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 5 per cent to $19.64 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead lost 2.7 per cent to $44.19.
120;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-03-04T22:04:32Z;Wall Street lifted by Chinese stimulus plans;;General Electric, once the biggest company in the world by capitalisation, on Wednesday saw its share price dip to a low not seen since 1991 during an otherwise positive day on Wall Street.GE was forced to issue a statement tackling rumours it would have to raise fresh capital as the cost of insuring against the company’s finance arm defaulting on its debt spiked.After falling steeply in early trade it the company’s shares bounced slightly when the company said it had “acted aggressively” to adapt to the current recession and had ”no plans to raise additional equity”. They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel. This was followed by energy companies, including Chevron, which rose 2.7 per cent to $59.28 and Exxon Mobil, which gained 2.1 per cent to $65.68.Caterpillar, which supplies machinery to domestic mining markets and to China directly, was a big gainer, rising 13.2 per cent to $25.44.A potential uptick in demand from Asia also helped technology stocks, which have been heavily sold during the first couple of months of 2009. Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share. Its shares fell 12.5 per cent to $11.01.This leaves Wells Fargo as the largest traditional commercial bank not to cut its dividend, and fears that it would soon do so sent the company’s stock down 9.5 per cent to $9.66.Insurers rallied after Tuesday’s falls on news that 12 life insurers have applied for capital injections from the Treasury in order to buy local lenders.MetLife rose 7.3 per cent to $14.72, while Lincoln National and Prudential gained 9.2 per cent to $7.16 and 7.1 per cent to $13.82 respectively.But the overall fall in the financial sector reflected fears in the credit markets about the security of those companies’ debts.The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, a measure of the counterparty risk in the sector, was at its highest level this morning since September last year, went Lehman Brothers went bust.
121;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-03-03T21:53:13Z;Insurers and financials foil Wall Street;;"The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day below the 700 points level for the first time since October 1996 in a choppy trading session dominated by news coming from Washington.Share prices fluctuated as President Barack Obama, Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, all spoke in what appeared to be a concerted effort to calm the markets after heavy sell-offs during the last week.But the effort appeared to have failed in the short term, with all three major indices closing down on Tuesday. The S&P lost 0.6 per cent to 696.33 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 6,726.02 points and the Nasdaq dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,321.01 points.Insurers led the afternoon’s retreat during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to a senate committee. Mr Bernanke said that the stricken insurer AIG had been a “hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company”. His words triggered fears about how exposed other insurers were to AIG.Metlife fell 16.9 per cent to $13.72. Lincoln National, which was hit by a ratings downgrade from Fitch, closed 14.9 per cent down at $6.56. Prudential lost 12.6 per cent to $12.90.After an early rally as bargain hunters looked to take advantage of low prices after Monday’s heavy falls, there was a mixed picture for the banks by the closing bell.Citigroup finished 1.7 per cent higher at $1.22 while Bank of America rose, in spite of being downgraded by S&P, the rating agency. It finished 0.6 per cent up at $3.65. Wells Fargo lost 1.6 per cent to $10.67.The early gains were eroded during Mr Bernanke’s testimony.Dave Rovell, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams, said: “It was the aggressive questioning from senators that weighed especially heavily. One spent a long time calling for nationalisation, putting pressure on financial stocks.”In the afternoon, Tim Geithner launched the term asset-backed securities loan facility, but the markets were left hungry for further details, and his words failed to spark a recovery.Mr Obama was even moved to give his own bullish assessment of stocks during the afternoon, saying, “Profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal.”Industrial stocks rose on speculation that China, the world’s biggest metal purchaser, could soon start to buy in large quantities.Metal companies performed particularly well. Freeport McMoRan, the copper producer, gained 7.3 per cent to $28.41, while Nucorp, which makes steel, rose by
4.5 per cent to $32.12.Energy stocks followed the price of oil higher. Consol Energy, which suffered in the previous session after announcing the temporary closure of its Buchanan coal mine in Virginia, gained 4.4 per cent to $32.57. Chevronalso picked up, rising 0.2 per cent to $57.73.GE, which dropped sharply on Monday after the announcement last week of the company’s first dividend cut since 1938, continued to lose ground, falling 7.8 per cent to $7.01.“GE looks relatively cheap but the company has
really very little in tangible assets,” said Steve Lehman from Federated Investors. There were also concerns that the company would soon have to raise capital.In the technology sector, Apple announced it would release a new Macbook laptop computer. Its shares rose 0.5 per cent to $88.37.Dell gained, in spite of a report on Monday from technology researcher Gartner that forecast an 11.9 per cent drop in personal computer sales this year. It gained 8.5 per cent to $9.15.There was more bad economic news as the number of pending US home sales, those for which contracts have been signed but the purchaser has not yet moved, fell by 7.7 per cent in January, more than twice as much as expected.The home building sector fell 7.5 per cent on the pending sales figure, and real estate stocks followed. Developers Diversified was the biggest loser, down 17.1 per cent to $1.94.There was no major spike in volatility, which analysts said would have to come before equity markets bottomed out. The Vix index, which measures volatility, fell 0.4 per cent."

The index finished 2.4 per cent higher on hopes that existing equity would at least not be wiped out altogether under further intervention from Washington.The wider market had a downbeat start to the wild session after National Association of Realtors data showed an unexpectedly steep fall in sales of previously owned homes as low prices failed to attract buyers.Yet stocks later rallied after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, again sought to calm nerves that a leading bank would be nationalised. “He has reinforced the message,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The government wants to take preference shares rather than common shares because it wants to give banks an easy way out if the worst doesn’t happen.”However, a strong afternoon rally gave way to a significant sell-off in the last half hour of trading and the wider market finished in the red.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “The bottom line is that we are still lacking any confidence and there is a fear factor the markets can’t seem to get rid of. On top of that, the market just isn’t buying the message coming out of President Obama’s White House at the moment.”At the end of the wild session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed 1.1 per cent lower at 764.90 points, 7,270.89 points and 1,425.43 points, respectively.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “People are buying on a rumour and selling on the subsequent news.”Among the volatile performers, Bank of Americaat one point was down 11.2 per cent after Merrill Lynch disclosed that ineffective internal controls had caused the bank to understate losses last year by $500m.The shares closed up 9.1 per cent at $5.16, as investors focused on the pledge from its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, that the lender would pass the government’s so-called stress test.Citigroup lost 16.9 per cent in the morning session, but rallied to stand 3.1 per cent lower at $2.52.The energy sector – down as much as 2.7 per cent in the morning session – later rallied to close 0.7 per cent lower.Although banking stocks finished higher, the financial sector overall lost ground, weighed down by insurers.Lincoln National reported its first loss in six years and slashed its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 1 cent. The shares sank 14 per cent to $11.21.The news had a knock-on effect on the rest of the life assurance sector.Prudential fell 2.7 per cent to $19.86, while MetLife lost 5.4 per cent to $22.05.Allstate shed 5.7 per cent to $17.57 after the home and car insurer also slashed its dividend by more than half, after two consecutive quarterly losses.But even though the market fell, the Vix – an index of anxiety – also eased 1.9 per cent to 44.6.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Would lower equity index prices be synonymous with a higher degree of investor fear? The answer turned out to be a resounding ‘no’.”Earlier in the session, the market had sold off heavily after investors overlooked the speech by President Obama the previous evening and focused on data that showed home purchases fell by 5.3 per cent to an annual rate of 4.49m, the fewest since 1997. The S&P fell 1.2 per cent in the 10 minutes after the figures were issued.Homebuilders shed 0.8 per cent overall in choppy trade.Industrials was the worst performing sector of the day, off 2.9 per cent overall. Boeing lost 4.3 per cent at $33.91 and Lockheed Martin 5.4 per cent at $70.46.Telecommunications was the only sector to find positive territory after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their view of AT&T to “overweight”.“Wireline guidance assumptions are conservative,” they wrote. The shares bucked the downward trend, up 2 per cent to $23.71.

The market recovered after the benchmark S&P 500 index hit 754 points, just two points away from an 11-year closing low, and the White House sought to reassure the markets that it was committed to a private banking system.Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent on Friday to $3.79 having earlier lost as much as 35.6 per cent, while Citigroup finished off 22.3 per cent to $1.95.After four days of declines the shares of Citi and Bofa had fallen 33.6 per cent and 44.7 per cent, respectively, as shareholders feared the government would take control and wipe out common equity. “Shareholders are taking what little is left on the table,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. “A little is better than zero.”Other banks were also hard hit as the S&P financial index passed another grim milestone, dropping to its lowest level since 1994.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, the two biggest banks in the US by market capitalisation, fell 3.4 per cent to $19.90 and 9.2 per cent to $10.91, respectively. That took their losses for the week to 19.5 per cent and 31.6 per cent.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said the market feared nationalisation was “obviously very, very close. The more you see the deterioration in the share price, the closer you get to that possibility.”The S&P and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off 1.1 per cent at 770.05 points and 1.3 per cent at 7,365.67 points, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,441.23 points.Downbeat results from Lowe’s weighed on consumer sectors.The shares fell 6.6 per cent to $15.86 after the home improvement retailer disclosed a sharp drop in quarterly profit.JC Penney rose 1.2 per cent to $15.10. Although the department store chain beat expectations for the fourth quarter, it forecast a wider-than-expected loss for the current period.For the holiday-shortened week, the S&P lost 6.9 per cent, the Dow 6.1 per cent and the Nasdaq 6.2 per cent.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 16 per cent over the week to 49.3. The sell-off took the S&P 500 2.3 per cent away from an 11-year low, prompting fears among technical analysts that the market could be set for yet more heavy selling were the benchmark index to breach the key technical support level.Insurers came under pressure, off 13.9 per cent overall, after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook.Shares in Prudential lost 30.3 per cent to $18.51.Weighing on the wider market, General Motors and Chrysler said they needed more government support than the $17.4bn already approved.GM shares lost 31.2 per cent to $1.77 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 9.7 per cent to $1.58.Homebuilders were also among the biggest losers, off 19.6 per cent overall, after the latest Commerce Department figures showed that US housing starts and permits fell by more than expected in January to the lowest levels on record.The technology sector shed 7.1 per cent overall after Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer makers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 12.7 per cent to $31.24 after the
company missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.Dell shed 8.9 per cent to $8.41 over the week."
124;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-02-19T23:59:23Z;US bank stocks fall to 17-year low;;US banking shares hit their lowest level since 1992 on Thursday as fears mounted that the government would be forced to nationalise a key institution.Further heavy selling of key names – Bank of America and Citigroup were once again among the worst performing, down 14 per cent to $3.93 and 13.8 per cent to $2.51, respectively – helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level in six years.Shares in several regional banks also sustained heavy losses as the S&P financial index dropped 5.2 per cent to its lowest level since 1995.“Every time someone mentions the word [nationalisation] then investors shiver – and with good reason,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “There’s a lot of angst over what [US Treasury Secretary] Geithner’s going to propose.”Insurers also suffered badly after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook. Shares in Prudential lost 15.9 per cent to $19.02 while Hartford Financial tumbled 24.5 per cent to $7.73.Talk of stake-building helped Principal Financial buck a downward trend for much of the session a day after the insurer said that it was exploring options to raise capital. The shares succumbed late in the day, off 0.4 per cent to $10.51.Relative strength in the energy, consumer and telecoms sectors helped pare the losses in the wider market, which drifted between losses and gains in choppy trading.The S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent at 778.94, its fourth consecutive retreat.The S&P slumped this week beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which has prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low. The S&P index stands only 3.5 per cent away from that bottom.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.2 per cent lower at 7,465.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index 1.7 per cent weaker at 1,442.82.The tech sector shed 3.3 per cent overall in the wake of Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer manufacturers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 7.9 per cent to $31.39 after the group missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.“We think the drivers of the revenue weakness are not isolated to HP but instead a reflection of the macro blues,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. Dell was one of the worst hit in the fallout, off 6.1 per cent to $8.12.Elsewhere, earnings that were not quite as bad as feared gave bargain hunters at some reasons to return to other sectors.Energy stocks found positive territory after the latest government report showed an unexpected drop in crude inventories.ExxonMobil edged 0.3 per cent higher to $72.16 even though Barclays downgraded its view from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Paul Cheng, analyst, said the stock’s valuation “appears toppy” and said the group may lower its medium term production target at the forthcoming analyst meeting.Telecoms performed relatively well, lifted 1 per cent overall by a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss from Sprint Nextel. The shares leapt 19.9 per cent to $3.25 as the group also said it expected subscriber losses to improve this year.Consumer discretionaries also outperformed. Whole Foods bounced 37.2 per cent to $12.75 as its first-quarter earnings fell less than forecast. “Even with the considerable economic headwind, the company, we believe, is beginning to take the steps to reverse the decline in its operating performance,” wrote analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded their recommendation on the stock to “buy”.Video game shares did well on an upbeat forecast from GameStop, which rallied 7.1 per cent to $26.63.Meanwhile, shares in drugstore Walgreens added 0.7 per cent to $25.83 on the back of well-received results from peer CVS Caremark, which climbed 6.4 per cent to $28.71.Bucking the upward momentum in the consumer sector, however, was Expedia, which lost 7.4 per cent to $7.90 after the online travel agency disclosed worse-than-expected earnings.
125;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-02-11T23:33:48Z;BoC is Beijing’s favourite for AIG deal;;"Bank of China has emerged as Beijing’s preferred choice as a potential bidder for the coveted Asian life assurance unit of AIG, which analysts estimate is worth about $20bn, according to people familiar with the matter.The mainland lender is in active discussions with financial advisers and Chinese policymakers about the merits of joining the auction for assets owned by the stricken US insurance giant.BoC’s surprise interest underscores renewed willingness in Beijing to consider investing in selective overseas financial assets. This is despite a recent string of disastrous investments in foreign banks and insurers.Dealmakers said that CIC, China’s sovereign wealth fund, is keen to back a single mainland bidder in the auction, and that BoC had overtaken China Life – the world’s largest insurer – as the most likely candidate.“The current thinking in Beijing is that BoC is better equipped to manage foreign assets than China Life, which has more limited overseas experience,” said one person familiar with the matter.Another said: “Beijing wants to back one horse but nothing has been decided yet. The Chinese might yet decide it is too risky to bid, given the state of the markets.”Last month, the US insurer sent a sales memorandum for American International Assurance to a group of potential bidders, according to people close to the situation. First-round bids are due at the end of this month.AIA, regarded as a jewel in AIG’s crown, boasts 20m policyholders across 13 Asian countries, employs 200,000 tied agents and last year made an aggregate operating profit of about $2bn.The auction of AIA was triggered by the need to repay a five-year, $60bn government loan. AIG came close to collapse last year and twice had to be bailed out by the US government, which now owns 80 per cent of the troubled insurer.The Financial Times reported last month that prospective bidders include HSBC, the UK-based bank; Prudential, the UK insurance group; as well as Prudential Financial of the US. ManuLife Financial, one of North America’s biggest insurance groups, and Allianz of Germany have also requested information.People close to the situation said AIG had asked interested parties to bid for 49 per cent of AIA, but said it would also be willing to look at offers for all of the unit.The size of AIA could also force potential buyers to form consortia and break up the asset among themselves. This means the list of bidders could change as the auction progresses.Additional reporting by Francesco Guerrera in New York"
126;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-01-21T23:30:40Z;AIG starts $20bn auction of Asian unit;;"AIG, the stricken insurance giant, on Wednesday kicked off the sale of its Asian life assurance unit – one of its most prized assets – in the hope of raising up to $20bn to help repay the $60bn US government loan that is keeping the group alive.The US insurer sent the sales memorandum for American International Assurance with limited information to a group of selected potential bidders, according to people close to the situation. First-round bids are due towards the end of next month.Prospective bidders include: China Life, the world’s largest life assurer; HSBC, the UK-based bank; Prudential, the UK insurance group; as well as Prudential Financial of the US.ManuLife Financial, one of North America’s biggest insurance groups, and Allianz of Germany have also requested information.People close to the situation said AIG had asked interested parties to bid for 49 per cent of AIA, but said it would be willing to look at offers for all of the unit. AIG could also opt for a full listing of the division if it does not achieve a high enough price.Any interested bidder will have to prove they can finance the acquisition, which has become increasingly difficult as credit markets have contracted. AIG is thought to be prepared to accept shares as acquisition currency.The size of AIA could also force potential buyers to form consortiums and break up the asset among themselves. This means that the list of the bidders could change as the auction progresses.“This has to be a flexible auction,” one person familiar with AIG’s thinking said.The auction of AIA, which follows last week’s opening of the sale process for AIG’s US life assurance unit, is a sign of its desire to speed up the repayment of the five-year $60bn government loan. AIG came close to collapse last year and had to be bailed out twice by the US government, which now owns 80 per cent of the troubled insurer.Edward Liddy, AIG’s
government-appointed chief executive, told the Financial Times recently that the company wanted to ask the authorities to renegotiate the terms of the loan once it had completed some big disposals.Some AIG executives believe that the insurer should press for a renegotiation of the $60bn loan earlier, especially if, as expected, the US government pours more money into the banking sector in the coming weeks.AIG and its advisers Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, all declined to comment.AIA, which was built into a powerhouse by its former chief executive Hank Greenberg, is regarded as a jewel in the company’s crown. Last year, it made an aggregate operating profit of about $2bn."
127;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-01-21T23:30:40Z;AIG’s Asian crown jewel will prove hard to value;;After months of methodical planning, the starting pistol has been fired in a race that could lead to American International Group divesting its most lucrative asset – its pan-Asian life assurance operations.The stricken US insurer was rescued from bankruptcy in September by the US government and is selling assets to help pay back part of a $60bn loan and ease the burden of its $150bn federal bail-out.AIG has, to date, announced several relatively small divestments. But all are dwarfed by the scale of AIA, a life assurer with leading market positions in several Asian countries, excluding Japan.Potential buyers this week have started to receive information about the asset, offering AIG’s first thinking as to its probable value.AIA, a cornerstone of the company’s business for a century, boasts 20m policyholders across 13 countries, employs 200,000 tied agents and last year made an aggregate operating profit of about $2bn.It also has a lucrative property portfolio, including landmark buildings in Hong Kong and Shanghai.AIG’s preference is to sell up to 49 per cent of AIA, to one or a number of buyers, in a deal that some analysts say could fetch $20bn.But AIG would be prepared to sell the whole of the business, possibly packaged into different parcels of assets, potential bidders say.How to value a life assurance company, with its complex mixture of long-term premium income and liabilities, has taxed the brightest minds.One valuation methodology is a multiple of embedded value – a measure that reflects the worth of the policies that life assurers already have on their books. Another is the value of one-year sales.There is precious little clarity on AIA’s probable value because it has never produced a separate set of accounts, with its performance to date mostly rolled into the group’s wider insurance-related disclosures.Some analysts have suggested that AIA could have an embedded value of $18bn-$20bn.The information sent to potential buyers does not include a final valuation figure, offering scope for intense negotiations in the coming weeks and months.Buyers are expected to challenge any valuation perceived to be too high, on the grounds that AIA is using unrealistic growth assumptions in markets that are experiencing significant economic slowdowns.AIG had preliminary interest from about 40 potential buyers.It has sent limited information to a select group of potential bidders including China Life, HSBC, Prudential of the UK as well as Prudential Financial of the US, Manulife of Canada and Allianz, the German insurer.But translating interest into firm offers will be another challenge altogether.First, while potential buyers acknowledge the special nature of the assets, many groups that previously would happily have entered a bidding war are no longer able to do so.The balance sheets of rival global insurers have taken a hit in recent months, while bancassurers, many of which help to distribute AIA products, are similarly capital-constrained.The same issue affects global private equity groups and sovereign wealth funds, which are licking their wounds following some disastrous financial sector investments, and rely on funding markets that now offer punitive lending rates.Chinese insurers retain significant financial firepower and want to diversify overseas. They are expected to study the proposal.However, Beijing is scarred by the losses made by Ping An, a leading domestic insurer, after its ill-fated venture with Fortis, the Dutch insurance group that was rescued by a government bail-out last year.One Hong Kong-based dealmaker familiar with the situation said: “The Chinese have the money and ambition but I seriously doubt whether any group can convince their government to allow them to spend so much on a minority stake.”Rivals eyeing the assets must also weigh up the risks involved in making a big acquisition with the possibility of waiting to pick off businesses or teams from AIA as the sale process is conducted.The process is expected to take anything up to six months, and AIG executives privately accept that a stake sale might not materialise. In which case, the company will consider alternatives, including an initial public offering.“This is going to be a long process, not a short one,” said one banker.www.ft.com/crisis
128;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2009-01-06T22:43:09Z;US stocks shrug off glum data;;"Technology stocks were among the big favourites on Wall Street on Tuesday as the market hit a fresh two-month high.Investors snapped up cash-rich blue chips in the sector, which rallied 3 per cent overall after more gloomy economic data provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession. Cisco and Intel climbed 4 per cent to $17.79 and 3.1 per cent to $15.37, respectively.Western Union jumped 8.5 per cent to $15.76 after Morgan Keegan upgraded its view of the money-transfer stock to “outperform”.“The global remittance market place is likely less sensitive to an economic downturn than Western Union shares currently reflect,” wrote the analysts.Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $20.76 following the release of Xbox sales figures, while Ciena soared 18.6 per cent to $8.40 on a tip from Barclays, which cited confidence in the communications equipment maker’s cash balance.However, Apple’s recent good run came to an end. The shares had gained further ground in the morning session after Oppenheimer analysts, who last month removed their price target on the stock, upgraded their view to “outperform” in the wake of Steve Jobs’s health update.Yet they later fell back to finish 1.7 per cent lower at $93.02 as the Macworld conference drew to a close without any blockbuster product announcements.The benchmark S&P 500 index overcame the previous session’s losses, up 0.8 per cent to close at 934.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 9,015.10 and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,652.38.Yet traditionally defensive sectors lost ground as investors dipped their toes into riskier stocks in areas such as retail. Healthcare, consumer staples and utilities – which outperformed the wider market last year – were the worst performing sectors.Celgene was among the poorest performing healthcare stocks, down 7.2 per cent to $50.47 after Baird downgraded its recommendation on the biopharmaceutical group to “neutral” due in part to concerns over Revlimid, a blood cancer drug.Johnson and Johnson dipped 0.6 per cent to $59.69 after Citigroup warned the coming year “looks more challenging than we realised”. Wall Street’s earnings estimates appear to be “too high”, wrote Matthew Dodds, Citi analyst, unless the group “either cuts expenses dramatically and/or does a massive stock buy-back”.The energy sector, which pared the market’s losses in the previous session, performed well in the morning session after oil prices hit the $50 a barrel level. Yet it later lost ground to enjoy only modest gains as crude fell back.Devon Energy eased 0.9 per cent to $70.37 after Barclays downgraded its
recommendation on the stock from “over weight” to “equal weight”.Thomas Driscoll, Barclays analyst, said the group had only hedged about 10 per cent of its 2009 natural gas production. “Devon is nearly alone among the large cap producers in that it has not hedged a substantial portion,” he wrote, “and as such could be most exposed to falling natural gas prices.”Prudential Financial was among several strong performers among insurers, up 14.9 per cent to $35.11 after Standard & Poor’s lifted its price target from $30 to $40. Bret Howlett, analyst, noted that the shares had more than doubled since they hit an all-time low in November.“The sharp rebound is a reflection of improved investor sentiment in the life insurance group as the spreads have tightened in the credit markets, the equity markets have rallied off of lows, and capital positions appear to be holding up,” he wrote.The wider financial sector gained 1.9 per cent overall.Elsewhere, Best Buy advanced 4.2 per cent to $31.25 after the electronics retailer disclosed plans to sell used iPhones for $50 less than new models. Among other consumer discretionary stocks to do well, Office Depot and Nordstrom added 8.1 per cent to $4 and 4.7 per cent to $15.91, respectively.The homebuilding sector rallied 5.1 per cent even though figures showed pending home sales sank to a seven-year low in November.The market had earlier trimmed more sizeable gains after Commerce Department figures showed US factory orders fell by 4.6 per cent in November, much more than expected and the fourth consecutive monthly decline."

The battered stock soared 102.4 per cent to $14.59 after the company said it was well capitalised.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.7 per cent at 876.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.1 per cent higher at 8,635.42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.4 per cent stronger at 1,509.31.The rally – albeit in light volume – came in spite of closely-watched Labor Department payroll figures that were much worse than even the most dire predictions.In reaction to the figures, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped as much as 3.2 per cent earlier in the session to test a weekly low of 815 that had been hit during a heavy sell-off on Monday.But traders appeared to be encouraged when the market failed to break through the key technical level, and the market subsequently rallied into the close.“There’s a lot of things you can use to predict a bottom. One of them is when the market stops reacting adversely to negative news,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.The reaction to the steepest job losses since 1974 was the latest example this week of a rally despite bleak news.Retailers gave bulls a faint glimmer of hope when traders shrugged off the worst monthly sales performance this decade. The S&P Retail index was up 6 cent for the week in spite of the release of November sales figures that were nevertheless not quite as dire as the most pessimistic predictions.Wal-Mart helped the sector with well received sales and shares in the discounter were up 4.2 per cent to $58.21 for the week.Macy’s which disclosed a sharp drop in like-for-like sales, finished the week up 16 per cent at $8.61.Friday’s rally helped the S&P pare its losses for the five-day period to 2.3 per cent, the Dow was down 2.2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.7 per cent lower.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up 7.8 per cent over the week and at 59.57 it indicated elevated signs of distress. The energy sector led weekly declines as it fell 11.3 per cent on a sharp slide in oil prices.The future of the ailing US car industry was among primary investor concerns as executives returned to Capitol Hill to plead for a $34bn bailout. General Motors finished the week down 22.1 per cent to $4.08 although Ford, which said it expected to at least break even by 2011, was up 1.1 per cent to $2.72.Defensive stocks failed to offer investors a haven – Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble fell 1.9 per cent to $45.98 and 2.7 per cent to $62.63, respectively – but there were bright spots elsewhere.Homebuilders finished the week 19.5 per cent higher amid reports that the Treasury Department was working on a plan to reduce mortgage rates on new home loans.Also helping the sector were data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing that its measure of mortgage application volumes had jumped the most last week since the index was created in 1990.On Friday, the financial sector rallied 8.6 per cent to lead the gains and took in Goldman Sachs, which jumped 4.7 per figures cent to $70.72 even after Morgan Stanley widened its fourth-quarter loss forecast from $1.09 to $4.45 a share.

The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.5 per cent at 1,698.52.Consumer stocks found positive territory even though the hit to GDP was driven by a 3.1 per cent drop in consumption, which had not declined since 1991. Consumer discretionaries were one of the biggest sectoral winners, up 3.3 per cent, while consumer staples stood 2.5 per cent higher.Hard-hit office retailers put in particularly strong performances after Staples upgraded its guidance for the quarter. Its shares jumped 15.6 per cent to $18.42.OfficeMax and Office Depot rocketed 46.1 per cent to $7.07 and 48.6 per cent to $3.12, respectively.Target, whose shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management is trying to persuade it to spin off the land beneath its stores into a real estate investment trust, gave back the strong gains of earlier in the week, falling 5.7 per cent to $38.39. Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup analyst, said she had “several concerns” about the hedge fund’s proposal, which the bank said could lead to a credit rating downgrade for the discount retailer.Also bucking the positive trend, Avon sank 15.4 per cent to $22.57 after the ­ cosmetics group missed ­forecasts due to particular weakness in North American sales.Colgate-Palmolive rose 7.1 per cent to $64.23 after the toothpaste group posted a slightly higher-than-expected quarterly profit.ExxonMobil’s better-than-expected earnings set another record in corporate profits but still failed to impress Wall Street. The group is planning to cut costs. Although traders welcomed the quarterly figures, the stock was down for much of the session although it recovered to close 0.5 per cent higher at $75.05.“Don’t be fooled,” said Professor Anthony Sabino of St John’s University. “These astronomical numbers were driven by a market frenzy that pushed up oil prices to absurd levels.” Chevron added 4.5 per cent to $74.18 ahead of its earnings on Friday.Elsewhere in the sector, First Solar jumped 24.5 per cent to $144.07 after increased demand for its technology helped the group beat expectations.Telecoms was the worst performing sector for the second session, up 0.8 per cent. Motorola slid 5.3 per cent to $5.17 after the group posted an unexpected third-quarter loss and said that the mobile device business spin off would be delayed.Among a host of insurers to post results after the previous session, Prudential Financial disclosed a quarterly loss and its shares fell 18.1 per cent to $28.87. Hartford Financial Services Group was among the biggest losers on the S&P, down 51.6 per cent to $9.62 on concerns it may need to raise more capital after swinging to a surprisingly large loss.

As the session drew to a close, the market fell by a jaw-dropping 5 per cent within 10 minutes.The S&P 500 finished 1.1 per cent lower at 930.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.8 per cent at 8,990.96. The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,657.21.Contributing to the confusion, Dow Jones reported that General Electric, which has not provided guidance for 2009, aimed to keep profits next year at the same level as this year even if revenue declined by between 10 and 15 per cent. The shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $19.20. After the close, GE said the report was “out of context” and “inaccurate”.Observers were divided as to the impact of the Fed’s 50 basis point cut, which was already priced in to the equity market.“What’s really driving the market are the other programmes that are breaking the log jams,” said Doug Roberts, strategist at Channel Capital Research, with reference to government measures to shore up the banking sector.Other recent monetary policy interventions had done little to help sentiment, but Joe Cusick, market analyst at optionsXpress, said: “This one’s a little bit different.”Fears of widespread financial collapse that trumped all other concerns had dissipated, he added, and a move to lower the cost of borrowing was likely now to have a tangible effect.Procter & Gamble lost 3.5 per cent to $60.99 after the consumer products group met analyst earnings estimates but still lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance. Citigroup maintained its “hold” rating on the stock.Kraft and Kellogg fell 1.4 per cent to $28.47 and 1.3 per cent to $50.02, respectively, even after price increases helped the food groups beat forecasts.Telecoms was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500, down 3.3 per cent overall. Investors were concerned by a sharp drop in basic video subscribers at Comcast, which dropped 9.9 per cent to $15.28, although the group reported better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Smaller rival Qwest slid 7.7 per cent to $2.40 after lowering its guidance for the year.Motorola fell 6.5 per cent to $5.46 ahead of results due on Friday. Reports said that the phone group would streamline its cellphone division and cut thousands of jobs.Energy was the biggest sectoral winner, up 3.6 per cent as oil prices edged higher. Solar energy stocks rallied after First Solar, which gained 1.5 per cent to $115.75, entered the residential market with a deal to supply modules to SolarCity, an installation company.Education stocks rose, helped by better-than-expected figures from Apollo Group, the parent company of the University of Phoenix, which rallied 10.4 per cent to $65.01.Aetna tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55 after the health insurer trimmed its forecast for the year. Fears over the prospect of writedowns and a possible capital-raising have driven the sector down sharply in recent months.Corning fell 8 per cent to $10.51 after the glass and ceramics maker missed analysts’ estimates on lower demand for televisions.General Motors rose 8.2 per cent to $6.76 after Reuters reported that the car group had resolved “major issues” with Chrysler owner Cerberus Capital Management over a potential merger.Visa edged up 1.4 per cent to $50.69. After the bell, the credit card group cut its annual revenue growth target, citing a challenging economy and the shares lost 1.2 per cent in after-hours trade.Among a host of insurers to post results after the bell, Prudential Financialdisclosed it swung to a quarterly loss. The shares were down 3.3 per cent at $35.25 and remained flat in after-hours trade.In addition to the rate cut, traders took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and data showing that durable goods orders rose unexpectedly last month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96.

The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher.

133;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2008-10-19T19:56:50Z;One seeder warming from the chill over hedge funds;;"Christianna Wood claims to have managed money in every time zone in the US. Starting her investment career in New Jersey, at Prudential Insurance in the 1980s, followed by stints in Chicago and Denver, she landed in Sacramento in 2002 as the head of global equities for Calpers, the $230bn (£131bn, €169bn) Californian pension fund. Migrating back east in March 2008, she took the chief executive spot at Capital Z Asset Management, based in Manhattan’s Union Square.Capital Z seeds hedge fund managers with early-stage capital, and was founded in 1999 as an outsourced alternative investment arm of Zurich Insurance. Of the 17 funds it has sponsored it still holds stakes in 11. Total invested assets are about $12.4bn, including a fund of funds composed of the managers it invests in.Sitting atop the equity world at Calpers was highly rewarding, and although she enjoyed and succeeded at the day-to-day portfolio management struggle, Ms Wood finds a strategic role more gratifying: “My real strengths are to build and grow businesses, and put together successful teams.” Since her arrival at Capital Z six months ago, the firm has added two fund investments.“I grew up in an environment of public service,” she notes. “Two of my brothers were military pilots. My father was vice-mayor of Rochester, New York, and an attorney who handled cases for the little guy, such as people beaten up by the police. He was not happy when I went to business school. But protecting the pensions of 1.4m Californians at Calpers for five years was very rewarding, and we helped author the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation.”While at Calpers, she expanded the fund’s activist portfolio from $1bn to $7bn, and built the hedge fund effort from next to nothing up to $7.5bn. She also ran the fund’s manager development program to fund nascent managers. The top spot at Capital Z matches Ms Wood’s team-building ambitions with the hedge fund world she knows well.In seeding hedge fund managers, some firms provide marketing and fundraising, or simply provide capital to invest in the portfolio, while Capital Z’s approach is closer to venture capital management. “Our investments are meant to make managers better, rather than simply bigger,” Ms Wood explains. In exchange for this consultative role, plus an investment as a limited partner, Capital Z receives an equity stake in the management company, typically 30 per cent. Investment performance of its funds is competitive, and in some cases “stellar,” as she puts it.A team of 10 seeks out seeding candidates, structures deals, monitors fund investment portfolios and works with managers on business issues. “Sometimes our role is helping a manager to find talent for another sleeve to their strategy, or to take their risk management to a higher level. We help them recognise when they need to hire a general counsel or CFO, or how to structure those relationships. It’s also important for managers to understand their current situation in terms of the firm’s entire life span,” she adds.In about half of the managers Capital Z has invested in, the firm provided the first $25-$50m of limited partner investment. In other cases, they have put in “acceleration capital,” to get funds across the crucial $100m threshold: any less and funds of funds are reluctant to invest, lest they hold too much of any single hedge fund. The $100m level is also important for prime broker and other counterparties, who feel more secure dealing with larger funds.The Capital Z roster includes four long-short equity strategies, three credit funds, several regional equity funds, a CTA manager, and a relative value bond fund. Ms Wood wonders whether one firm, European activist investors Cevian Capital, should even be called a hedge fund: its fund invests only on the long side, and uses no
leverage.Ms Wood believes the shrinking of hedge funds, from both the falling value of portfolios and closing of funds, will bring a shift of power in the industry. “The firms to come out of this with the best performance will not be the biggest ones, but instead those with assets from $1bn to $3bn, because they have the best mix of talent, and they can be more nimble investors,” she says.Investors will therefore need to be selective, and not just throw money at big-name funds. “The shrinking of portfolios will tell us a lot about the skill of hedge fund managers,” she adds. “Skill has been hard to detect in an environment of low volatility, but these markets will show greater distinctions.” She also expects that securities lending and short selling will face closer scrutiny, making short-side alpha more expensive and difficult to achieve.She sees an increasing respect from hedge fund managers toward their institutional clients.“The hot money leaving hedge funds today tends to be individuals. I’m seeing that most large, well-established pension funds are not redeeming.”The chill over hedge funds is nonetheless benefiting seeders such as Capital Z. “Already the quality and quantity of our deal flow has improved, from the Wall Street lay-offs, and from the many managers that started up in 2007 and 2008 but could not get traction in the tough environment,” Ms Wood says.“The world is not awash in capital, and there’s a better appreciation for the sort of long-term funding a hedge fund seeder can bring to the table.”"
134;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2008-10-13T20:43:47Z;US rally follows worst trading week since Depression;;The latest round of vast interventions in the financial system from authorities around the world stoked one of Wall Street’s strongest ever rallies following its worst sell-off since the Depression.Carmakers, oil refiners and health care groups were among the favourites as traders snapped up battered stocks, some of which had slumped to their lowest levels in decades.Morgan Stanley’s long-awaited $9bn investment deal with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial also improved the grim mood. Uncertainty that hung over the deal for days had weighed on the wider market even after both parties insisted it would go ahead. Morgan topped S&P 500 leaderboard, up 85.1 per cent to $17.92, while peer Goldman Sachs climbed 25 per cent to $111.The benchmark index surged 11.6 per cent to 1,003.32 points, ending an eight-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 11.1 per cent to 9,387.61 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 11.8 per cent to 1,844.25 points.Some observers said it was difficult to draw conclusions from the thinned trading and put much of the gains down to short covering. Bond markets were closed owing to the Columbus Day holiday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 20.4 per cent on Monday, although at 55.65 it continued to indicate signs of severe distress.Among the winners in financials, Citigroup, which last week withdrew from talks to buy parts of Wachovia, rallied 11.6 per cent to $15.75. Wells Fargo also gained, up 7.4 per cent to $30.40, after the Federal Reserve approved its $12.2bn takeover of the embattled investment bank, which jumped 13.6 per cent to $5.85.Sovereign Bank fell 3.4 per cent to $3.68 ever after it emerged Banco Santander of Spain was in talks to acquire one of the nation’s few remaining independent thrifts.Insurers also recovered after being routed in previous sessions. Hartford Financial Services, XL Capital and Prudential Financial climbed 28.1 per cent to $24.63, 36.8 per cent to $7.43 and 38.3 per cent to $49.95, respectively.Fox-Pitt Kelton said XL, which slumped 63.8 per cent last week, might have to consider a “hasty sale”.The energy sector, which lost 22 per cent last week, recovered 18.5 per cent and led the gains on hopes the forthcoming economic slowdown would not be as bad as last week’s brutal sell-off implied.“This is not a Great Depression II,” wrote Merrill Lynch in a note to clients. “Bank failures, evaporation of disposable income, industrial production decl­ines and risk premiums for bonds were significantly worse then versus now.”General Motors, which last week sank to its lowest since 1950, recovered 33.1 per cent to $6.51 on reports that the carmaker had held merger talks with Ford Motor and Chrysler. The former jumped 20.1 per cent to $2.39, also helped by reports that the group was considering selling its controlling stake in Mazda, Japanese counterpart.Telecoms was another big winner, up 9.6 per cent. AT&T rallied 16.3 per cent to $26.07 after the group agreed its first retail distribution arrangements to sell its high-speed internet and video service. Wal-Mart and Circuit City, with which it struck the deals, added 7 per cent to $54.50 and 8.1 per cent to $0.40, respectively.Qwest Communications jumped 25.7 per cent to $2.74 after the phone company reached an agreement with its largest union over a pay dispute.King Pharmaceuticals was among the leading winners in the healthcare sector, which was also hit hard last week in spite of its defensive qualities yet recovered 12.4 per cent on Monday. King jumped 18.6 per cent to $9.26 after the group extended by more than a month the deadline for its $37-a-share takeover bid for Alpharma, which rose 10.4 per cent to $33.80.The cash-rich technology sector also did well, up 12.1 per cent. Apple rose 13.9 per cent to $110.26 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”.Elsewhere, Waste Management added 18 per cent to $30.39 after the trash hauler walked away from its $6.73bn hostile takeover of Republic Services, which rose 8.9 per cent to $24.50.
135;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2008-10-09T19:45:42Z;MetLife sells stock at a discount to raise $2bn;;It emerged on Thursday that MetLife, the largest US life assurer, had to sell stock at a discount on Wednesday in an effort to reassure the markets over its capital base, helping to drive down the shares of its competitors on fears they would have to follow suit.MetLife, which has seen its market capitalisation almost halve so far this month, sold the 75m shares at $26.50 a share on Wednesday, 28 per cent less than its closing price on Tuesday, raising nearly $2bn.Insurers’ stocks have been severely hit in recent weeks and the cost of insuring their debt has risen to record levels on concerns that their exposure to credit markets and the extent of their leverage could rapidly eat into their capital bases.Last month, AIG, which was once the world’s biggest insurer, was bailed out after huge loses in its financial products unit forced it close to collapse.MetLife’s sale of stock helped to drive down other insurers as investors bet that they would also need to dilute shareholders.Prudential Financial fell as much as 38 per cent in morning trading, while Principal Financial Group fell by as much as 14.5 per cent.“Investors [hedge funds] think they are the next to raise capital …and now, for the first time in a month, the shorts can actually short financials again, so Pru is the focus,” said Alan Devlin, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.Hartford Financial sold $2.5bn in stock and debt to Allianz SE earlier this week. UBS on Thursday cut its price guidance on the company to $26 a share from $70 a share.Analysts expect insurers to return for repeated capital raisings in order to maintain their credit ratings – which are critical to attracting new business.Some also expect smaller insurers that have difficulty raising capital to be acquired by larger competitors.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see MetLife or ManuLife, now it has raised capital, to consume a smaller competitor who can’t raise capital – a Lincoln or Principal for example,” said Mr Devlin.
136;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2008-08-27T21:34:04Z;Incomers and leavers;;"INStephen Hester runs one of Britain’s biggest property companies but has long been tipped to return to a senior position in banking and finance, writes Jane Croft.The 47-year-old chief executive of British Land trained as an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston.Property specialists say he has spurned the traditional spivvy image of the real estate sector, bringing a hard-headed investment banking approach to his management of British Land and limiting lunches to salads and mineral water.Mr Hester came to prominence in 2002, as chief operating officer at Abbey National. Mr Hester, who is forthright and highly ambitious, had long wanted to be chief executive of a FTSE 100 company.Some observers did not expect him to make much of a mark at British Land, given the imposing reputation of his predecessor, Sir John Ritblat, who remained as chairman.But within months of joining he disposed of its luxurious headquarters next to Regent’s Park and bought and sold billions of pounds of property.Recently, he shelved the development of the so-called Cheesegrater skyscraper because of the downturn. Despite the problems facing the sector, the company is now relatively well positioned with a £2.6bn war chest and a strong balance sheet.On Wednesday, he relinquished his role as deputy chairman of Northern Rock.John McFarlane, for most of his decade-long career with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), was widely considered to be one of Australia’s best chief executives, writes Elizabeth Fry in Sydney.During his term in the top job, Mr McFarlane moved swiftly to rebalance ANZ away from its reliance on corporate and investment banking, developing a low-risk retail banking franchise.Known for his charisma and affability, Mr McFarlane energised the bank and its staff, but retired as CEO last August under something of a cloud, after profits faltered.The bank has since uncovered deficiencies in previous risk management and compliance systems.Mr McFarlane, 61, had earlier worked at Ford, Citibank and Standard Chartered.Arthur Ryan, 66, has a long pedigree in financial services, writes Daniel Pimlott in New York.The man who retired in May as chairman of US life assurer Prudential Financial had been the first outsider to head the group, and took it public in 2001.His 14 years at Prudential followed 22 years at Chase Manhattan.He was head of its retail bank from 1984 to 1990 and was president and chief operating officer from 1990 to 1994. A tall man with a friendly manner, he was known at Chase as an aggressive operator with a memory for detail and a tough management style that reportedly earned him the nickname “the gorilla”.OUTLarry Fish, a non-executive director since May, had previously been an executive at the bank, appointed to the board in 1993.
Bud Koch, on the board since 2004, was previously chairman, president and CEO of Charter One Financial in the US."
137;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2008-08-27T20:40:09Z;Hester in running to succeed Goodwin at RBS;;"Stephen Hester, chief executive of British Land, emerged as a candidate to succeed Sir Fred Goodwin at the helm of Royal Bank of Scotland on Wednesday.Mr Hester, 47, was one of three non-executive directors appointed by the UK’s second-largest bank, which has been under fire from investors after heavy losses arising from the credit crunch; a troubled recent £12bn rights issue; and its share in the €71bn acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro.Institutional investors have been pressing for a clear succession plan for Sir Fred, the bank’s chief executive, and Sir Tom McKillop, chairman.RBS also announced the appointments of John McFarlane, 61, fomerly chief executive of Australia’s ANZ banking group, and Arthur Ryan, 65, a former chairman of Prudential Financial in the US.Leading investors applauded the moves. “They make up a good back row,” said one.Some investors also suggested Mr Hester could be a candidate to replace Sir Fred, while Mr McFarlane is seen as a favourite to replace Bob Scott, RBS’s senior independent director.Mr Hester, a former chief operating officer of Abbey National, has no plans to leave British Land for at least a year and will join the RBS board in October.However, he is thought to be undecided about whether he wants to build a portfolio of non-executive directorships or take another chief executive role.Analysts said the appointments were unlikely to appease those investors who had been calling for Sir Tom and Sir Fred to be removed. “Is this enough?” said Mamoun Tazi, analyst at Man Securities. “Probably not. Unless there are changes to the way the bank’s strategy is drawn up and implemented.”"
138;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Insurance earnings lift FTSE;;London equities rose on Wednesday, with insurance stocks leading the way after well-received earnings lifted the mood.Positive earnings news and gains in New York helped underpin the wider market. At the close, the FTSE 100 index was up 101.5 points to 5,420.7, helped also by the heavily-weighted mining sector after impressive results from world-leading steel producer ArcelorMittal. The FTSE 250 rose 1.8 per cent to 8,886.3Financial stocks moved higher in tandem with Wall Street peers after the US Federal Reserve said it would extend its emergency borrowing programme.Admiral, the specialist car insurer, rose 10.8 per cent to 914p. The recent graduate to the FTSE 100 reported a 16 per cent rise in interim profit before tax of £100.3m, beating consensus forecasts. The owner of the confused.com price comparison website said rising premiums and a “relatively benign claims experience” combined to boost its bottom line.Fellow insurer Aviva rose 8.7 per cent to 507½p after its second quarter earnings met forecasts. The UK’s biggest insurer also pledged to return £1bn to policyholders in a long-awaited plan to re-allocate surplus assets.The strong set of news was enough to give the wider sector a lift. Friends Provident was lifted 5.9 per cent to 86.3p, Legal & General added 5.4 per cent to 98½p and Prudential was 5 per cent higher at 537p.LLoyds TSB opened the reporting season for UK banks with news of lower-than-forecast interim profits of £599m, down 70 per cent, as asset write offs and volatility in its insurance business hit the figures. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to 306.3p.James Eden, an analyst atExane BNP Paribas said: “Fortune does not always favour the brave. It is clear that the market has severe doubts about the sustainability of the dividend – rightly so. In our core macro-scenario, which is for the UK to flirt with recession, the dividend will be uncovered on a statutory basis in 2008, with cover improving to 1.5 times in 2010. In this scenario, we think Lloyds TSB can squeak through without a dividend cut. Of course, in a 1990s macro-scenario, the dividend is toast.”Miners were strong, with Anglo American up 3.9 per cent to £29.10, even after Credit Suisse cut forecasts ahead of Anglo’s earnings on Friday.But Aquarius Platinum lagged, dropping 6.5 per cent to 503p. Citigroup cut earnings forecasts for the group to reflect rising costs, while Goldman Sachs lowered its platinum expectations because of weakening demand from the jewellery industry.Drinks can maker Rexam was 9.5 per cent higher at 380½p after it posted a 61 per cent rise in interim profits, beating consensus forecasts.Next lost initial gains in the wake of its second quarter earnings to fall 1 per cent to 995½p. The fashion retailer’s numbers met forecasts but it remained cautious about the outlook for the second half, saying it saw “no reason for any improvement in consumer spending.”Similar worries about the affordability of mortgages and the outlook for falling house prices kept housebuilders mired at the bottom of the FTSE 250. Taylor Wimpey was the biggest single casualty, down 6.5 per cent at 42½p with Bellway down 4.7 per cent at 491½p.Regus missed out the rally amid concerns about the serviced-office provider’s earnings and balance sheet.The stock closed 2p lower at 71p after UBS moved to a “sell” stance with a 50p target price.Stephen Swanton, analyst, said: “So far, we do not believe that economic reality has yet hit the serviced-office market but, in our view, these trends will eventually take their toll”. He set 2009 earnings forecasts 30 per cent below the consensus.As earnings growth stalled, investors would pay more attention to off-balance sheet liabilities, UBS argued.Regus had operating lease commitments of £1.5bn at the end of 2007. UBS put a net present value of £2.2bn on these liabilities, which would put the stock at a sharp premium to the equipment rental sector, which capitalises most of its assets.Mr Swanton told clients: “We believe that the size of these liabilities poses significant near-term risk to Regus’ equity value”.Short covering helped lift British Airways by 5.8 per cent to 263p after confirmation it was talking to Spain’s Iberia about a possible merger. Deutsche Bank, Cazenove and Exane all took BA shares off their “sell” lists.Cazenove said: “The synergies to be derived from a BA-Iberia merger could be as much as £200m-£400m over five years and could add some 30-50 per cent to the value of BA shares.“It is not, however, a surprise that the market did not price in this benefit …given the time it will take to complete the merger and the very uncertain and possibly deteriorating trading environment, which could potentially undermine the starting financial base of the merged entity.”EasyJet was up 3.8 per cent to 330p after Goldman Sachs took the shares off its “conviction sell” list as a stop-loss following their rally with the oil price.
139;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Ping An head eyes capital-raising moves;;The head of Ping An Insurance, China’s second largest life assurer, has ambitious capital-raising plans that could range from rights offerings to the launch of a private equity fund.Chinese reports say Peter Ma is planning to invest up to Rmb100bn ($14.3bn) in its private equity, infrastructure and real estate businesses with a view to them later launching initial public offerings.But bankers and insurance industry sources in New York say Mr Ma has had extensive discussions with Goldman Sachs in recent months, seeking advice about raising money for a private equity fund that would invest in both China and the rest of the world and could total as much as $18bn, which would put it on a par with the world’s largest funds.The private equity arms of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were early investors in Ping An and made large profits when they were able to cash out of their stakes. HSBC holds 16.7 per cent in Ping An, a stake which could be diluted if the insurer has further capital raisings.Mr Ma has been considering large rights offerings in the stock market in Hong Kong and Shanghai, as well as possible convertible bond offers to finance his voracious appetite for acquisitions of insurers and banks.But stock market volatility in both markets over the past few months has complicated those plans. Other mainland issuers have cut back the size of planned offers, in response to the weakness in the market.Ping An has been named as a potential buyer of Prudential Insurance in the UK. In November, it bought a 4.2 per cent stake in Fortis, the Belgian financial conglomerate, and plans to establish a wealth management joint venture with Fortis.Ping An also acquired Hong Kong-based Value Partners, one of the largest local hedge fund and investment firms. In 2006, Mr Ma acquired Shenzhen Commercial Bank, a small bank which, like Ping An, is based in Shenzhen.Chinese insurers including China Life, the country’s largest, have been sharpening their investment skills both at home and abroad. But there are few companies in China that have as long a history as Ping An in recruiting foreign executives and growing by acquisition.Speculation concerning Mr Ma’s intentions comes at a time when private equity funds are being established in China, providing competition to global firms operating in the country such as Blackstone and TPG. At the same time, Chinese players are becoming more aggressive as they venture abroad.

Aviva said it will focus on developing LIG’s distribution, using Woori’s nationwide banking network and increasing the number of sales agents.LIG is one of the smallest life insurers in South Korea focused on the Busan metropolitan area. It reported life insurance premium income of Won328bn and total assets of Won1,300bn in the fiscal year 2007 ended March 31.Aviva already generates 8 per cent of its sales in Asia. It recently set up a joint venture in Taiwan with First Financial and plans to expand into other markets through acquisitions or joint ventures as it targets a 20 per cent annual growth in Asia Pacific.ING and Prudential Financial are among a number of foreign players that have already been tempted by South Korea’s $356bn insurance market. However, the market is still dominated by local heavyweights such as Samsung Life Insurance and Korea Life Insurance.In December, the Korean government announced a set of new rules aimed at deregulating the country’s financial sector. The proposals, for example, give insurers more leeway in offering new products and diversifying sales channels.The LIG sale has reportedly drawn several foreign bidders including Standard Chartered, Canada’s Manulife and New York Life.Bryan Song, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that Aviva would be able to help promote LIG’s growth in Korea with its product development experience in Asia and its knowledge of the market, so reducing operational risks for Woori.

And again it’s not just restricted to NRIs – we can target international investors of any shape or hue.”India’s mutual fund industry is booming, with total assets under management in the country rising to Rs5,379bn at the end of November, up nearly 60 per cent since January.The industry used to be dominated by the state-run group UTI Asset Management Company but it has since been overcome by aggressive private operators.These include Reliance and Prudential ICICI Asset Management, a joint venture between Prudential of the UK and ICICI, the leading domestic private sector bank.Reliance’s growth, in particular, has been rapid, from $100m of assets under management in 2001 to about $20bn as of November.New entrants include Prudential Financial, the second largest US life assurer, which last week said it would buy a 61 per cent stake in a mutual fund joint venture with DLF, India’s largest developer.Reliance said the investment by Eton Park, a hedge fund founded by former Goldman Sachs Group partner Eric Mindich, valued the mutual fund at 13 per cent of assets under management, twice the valuation of previous such deals in the industry.Mr Mindich said: “We share Reliance Capital’s excitement on the growth prospects of the industry.”Indian companies are increasingly selling small stakes in unlisted companies as a way of obtaining a market valuation for units buried in larger entities.Reliance Capital Asset Management is part of the larger Reliance Capital group, which has $15bn in assets.
142;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2007-10-12T08:34:49Z;Pensions: Reporting longevity;;In navigation, there is the one-in-60 rule, which states that if you fly one degree off your plotted course, after 60 miles, you will be one mile adrift of your intended position. Philip Broadley, a keen pilot and chief financial officer of Prudential, uses the rule to illustrate the problem of valuing pensions. ”To be able to navigate to within one degree using just a map and a compass is skilful,” he says. ”With pensions, trying to predict some sort of precise course for how your liabilities are going to extend out works in the same way – you can’t navigate precisely the further out you go so there will be some drift.”Pensions have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. Issues have ranged from the dramatic shift away from defined benefit to defined contribution plans and the abolition of tax credit for funds, to the upheaval caused when accounting changes resulted in wild swings in stated surpluses and deficits. On top of this are the perennial problems associated with choosing the right assumptions when attempting to value liabilities that stretch into decades, which become increasingly hard to measure with any accuracy the further away they are. ”You almost want to say whatever this number turns out to really be in 30 years time, I can almost guarantee you it won’t be the one in front of you now,” says one finance executive.In November 2000, the UK Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17, which would bring pensions, surplus or deficit, fully on to company balance sheets. Given the timing – as the stock market began its long post-dotcom tumble – the notion of huge deficits really began to hit investors’ radar screens.By August 2003, one firm of actuaries calculated that the deficits among the FTSE 100 schemes were so large that stock markets would need a 50 per cent jump over the next year to wipe out the gap. Companies started increasing their contributions to fill the holes, but with the FTSE 100 deficit at over £85bn that year, progress was limited. By this summer, FTSE 100 schemes were registering a slight surplus for the first time, according to the annual survey by Lane, Clark and Peacock, the actuaries.Essentially, by bringing the liabilities on to the balance sheet, accounting standard setters made it clear that they were to be considered as debt. Investors needed to know the scale of the liabilities to gauge a company’s value and the risks it faced. The issues since then have been mostly of what information – and how much of it – is needed in corporate reporting to help investors understand the implications of pensions on the business.One of the most discussed factors has been longevity risk, or the danger that we are all living longer. ”When I started in this sector, life expectancy was maybe to your early 80s,” says Brian Peters, partner in PwC’s pensions business. ”Now it is my late 80s – in the space of 15 years, my life expectancy is up by between 5 and 10 per cent. The costs of that are immense.”Peter Elwin, head of accounting and valuation research at Cazenove, believes longevity assumptions will have to rise further. ”Companies have under-reserved in the past for longevity increases, though it is hard to spot exactly which ones have done this,” he says. ”As rules change, which encourages pension trustees and actuaries to use more conservative assumptions, we’re only going to see liabilities increase.”For investors trying to figure out how companies come to value their pension liabilities, longevity assumptions are a key part of the puzzle but are usually incomplete. Even if companies state a life expectancy, they can legitimately use different numbers depending on their workforce. Moreover, the number is a crude reckoning because it is based on a complicated cumulative probability calculation. ”Taking that and boiling it down to one number is really a shortcut,” says Mr Elwin. ”I’d rather have it than not, since it is a starting point for asking questions, but that is all it is.”In addition to how long we will live, there has been increasing attention on a different form of valuation – the buy-out, or discontinuance, liability. This is the price at which the company could offload the entire scheme and all its liabilities to someone else, usually an insurance company. The trustees calculate the liabilities of the fund and then figure out how these are to be hedged or covered. The cover consists of the existing assets, their expected returns, the agreed future contributions and the expected returns on them, plus the unfunded corporate covenant assumed by most trustees. This last issue is the issue that trustees think might need to be covered, but they plan to leave asking the company until the additional amount becomes clearer. In effect, the agreed future contributions and the expected returns are also part of the covenant since trustees assume the company will make good on its obligations.The result of all this is a value far higher – perhaps as much as 30 per cent more – than decreed by the 2005 international financial reporting standards through IAS 19. The buy-out liability is not a number any company has to disclose, but it is the one on which trustees are basing their calculations.The implications of this became apparent in June, when KKR, the private equity group, was forced to reach a deal with the Boots pension scheme when the plan’s trustees threatened to use their position as the retailer’s largest creditor to derail KKR’s planned takeover. The private equity agreed to increase its cash payment to the fund to meet the £305m shortfall the trustees claimed and also provided additional security to the value of £600m.The market for pure buy-outs is hotting up. Long dominated by Legal & General and Prudential, who traditionally wound up the schemes and replaced them with annuities, there are now players looking to maintain the funds and run them more efficiently. Last month, Pension Corporation bid for Telent, the rump of former telecoms giant Marconi, with the aim of selling the business and keeping the pension fund. This summer, Citigroup entered the market, buying the £200m closed scheme of Thomson Regional Newspapers.However, a buy-out value might be of limited use for the biggest schemes. ”The market is relatively small and I think for many of us the more accurate answer would be to say we don’t know,” says Mr Broadley. ”No scheme of our size has gone through this – it is not a solution really available to us. ”The buy-out liability is saying if you want to transfer liabilities to a willing buyer, what would the price be. For a lot of schemes in the FTSE 100, it is beyond the ability of any single insurance company to take these on.”Mr Elwin contends the number can still have value. ”It is true there isn’t an insurance company on the planet that would find it easy to swallow the biggest funds, but if the trustees are basing their calculations on this, it is a very important number to know,” he says.It seems even though stock market gains and higher bond yields have brought Britain’s pension schemes back into surplus – at least on a current accounting basis – it doesn’t mean there is any end in sight for the ever-growing size of the liabilities.

The Boston-based company made the ann­ouncement on Monday.John Bonnanzio, editor of Fidelity Insight, a monthly investment advisory newsletter, said the appointment – which comes after several high-ranking executives have left the company – “changes the calculus” of who will take the helm once Mr Johnson retires.Until now, Abigail Johnson, head of Fidelity’s employer-services unit and daughter of Mr Johnson, and Ellyn McColgan, the brokerage division chief also in charge of distribution and operations, had been seen as the two frontrunners, acc­ording to Mr Bonnanzio.“We had been looking at a field of two possible successors,” he said. “Now we have to assume there’s a third player [in Mr Lawson].”Mr Lawson, who was most recently vice-chairman for the international insurance and investments division of Prudential Financial, headed Fidelity’s retail operation from May 1985 to May 1991. During his tenure, the company’s retail assets rose almost fourfold to $83bn and customer accounts increased from 3m to 7m, Fidelity said.“The industry was ready to explode at that point,” said Mr Bonnanzio, adding that the mutual fund landscape had become more competitive since then. “Today he’s playing in a completely different ball field.”Mr Lawson will be responsible for Fidelity Employer Services, Fidelity Investments Distribution and Operations, and Fidelity Technology Group.Mr Johnson, whose father founded the privately held firm more than 60 years ago, will continue to oversee Fidelity Management and Research, Pyramis Global Advisors and Devonshire Investors, the company said.“Ned is still in control of the mutual fund side of the house, which is the big money earner for the company,” noted Jack Bowers, editor of Fidelity Monitor.

145;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Markus Rosgen, chief Asia strategist, said that valuations had recently hit levels only seen in crisis periods.Among the stocks rated as “buy”, computer maker Acer rose 0.9 per cent to T$65.60, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company added 3.1 per cent to T$70.40 and Formosa Plastics climbed 5.3 per cent to T$85.50.Adding to the foreign interest, was US fund group Prudential Financial, which said it was adding Taiwan stocks to its portfolios.A number of chip packaging and testing companies benefitted after Taiwan’s economics ministry approved factories being set up in China, to cash in on the world’s fastest growing market for memory chips. Among them, Walton Advanced Engineering jumped 5.1 per cent to T$22.70, while Greatek Electronics rose 3.4 per cent to T$58.In contrast to its upgrade of Taiwan, Citi downgraded Singapore from “overweight” to “underweight”, considering the market overvalued.The Straits Times Index fell 1 per cent to 3,580.33 as financial stocks reversed. Among them DBS Holdings shed 1.3 per cent to S$23.40.Higher-than-expected inflation in May hit Singapore’s property stocks. Allgreen Property fell 4.4 per cent to S$2.15, while Capmall Trust shed 3.7 per cent to S$4.12.Chinese stocks suffered their biggest daily decline in three weeks after the central bank warned of excessive valuations, prompting concerns measures may be taken to cool the market.The Shanghai Composite index fell 3.7 per cent to 3,941.08, hit by falling resource stocks over fears that cooling measures would damp demand for raw materials.Jiangxi Copper shed 6.1 per cent to Rmb25.49, while China Petroleum & Chemical lost 5.7 per cent to Rmb13.47.Japanese stocks fell as the real estate sector took a pummelling over US concerns about the credit market and the prospect of higher US interest rates.The Nikkei 225 dipped 0.6 per cent to close at 18,087.48 while the broader Topix index was down 0.7 per cent at 1,764.87.The Tokyo Stock Exchange’s real estate sector sank 2.9 per cent. Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s biggest property company, dropped 2.8 per cent to Y3,430, Mitsubishi Estate, its largest rival, declined 2.4 per cent to Y3,330, while Sumitomo Realty & Development slid 3.9 per cent to Y4,000. Real estate investment trusts also suffered, with the TSE’s Reit index dropping 1.7 per cent to 2,309.56.Merger activity helped stir some investor appetite, however. Maruetsu jumped 2.9 per cent to Y564 after Aeon, Japan’s largest retailer by store numbers, unveiled plans to take a further 10-12 per cent stake in the supermarket operator. Aeon fell 1.8 per cent to Y2,215.JVC, the struggling Japanese electronics maker, leapt 3 per cent to Y407 on the news it will merge with audio equipment maker Kenwood. This follows abortive attempts by JVC to clinch a deal with private equity firm TPG. Kenwood declined 2 per cent to Y192.Bull-Dog Sauce fell 2.1 per cent to Y1,646 after the company adopted a poison pill defence scheme designed to protect it from takeover by US activist fund Steel Partners.The securities sector dropped almost 2 per cent. Nomura Holdings, Japan’s biggest securities house, fell 2 per cent to Y2,460.
147;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2007-06-21T18:24:33Z;Blackstone’s costly float;;"As he listened to the pleas of Stephen Schwarzman and Peter Peterson for a $100m (£50m, €75m) investment in Blackstone, their newly launched private equity group, Garnett Keith had one question on his mind.“Could these guys build and run an organisation?” Mr Keith, then vice-chairman of the US insurer Prudential, recalls asking himself during a frugal lunch with the two former Lehman Brothers bankers in 1985.In the event, Prudential parted with the $100m, significantly augmenting the $400,000 war chest of Blackstone’s co-founders and marking the beginning of the firm’s spectacular ascent from small upstart to dominant force in US finance.On Friday, 22 years after that lunch, Mr Schwarzman and Mr Peterson will provide an emphatic answer to Mr Keith’s nagging concern – from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.Blackstone’s listing of a stake of just over 20 per cent for up to $7.8bn – the third-largest US initial public offering ever and the first by a large private equity house – is already being billed as “the” Wall Street event of the year.Taking public a business predicated on buying listed companies and transforming them under the veil of private ownership is in itself a consecration of the ingenuity and dealmaking prowess of its founders.But the listing is more than a lucrative victory lap for the two high-profile financiers, who between them stand to receive up to $2.6bn from the IPO. By braving the stock market, Blackstone and Mr Schwarzman, the son of a Philadelphia clothing merchant, have become symbols of the golden era currently enjoyed by private equity. The role has attracted both acclaim and controversy.As Blackstone prepares for its stock market debut, the question for buy-out executives, investors and regulators is whether its pioneering move is the start of a new period of maturity for private equity or the harbinger of the imminent bursting of its bubble. “This is a seminal moment,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor. “History will either judge [the Blackstone IPO] to be the most outlandish thing in this crazy market­place or the most amazing move for the future of the industry.”Braving the capital markets is a high-stake bet for Blackstone. Its main goal is clear: trying to secure a permanent source of funding, to reduce its reliance on multiple rounds of fundraising from pension funds and other investors.But the chance to raise billions of dollars from equity markets, which are set to value the company at more than $30bn, exacted a heavy price. The rigorous disclosure required by the IPO thrust into the open Blackstone’s low tax rate and aggressive accounting. It also revealed the extraordinary pay-outs to be received by Mr Peterson and Mr Schwarzman, at or near the peak of the private equity boom. The effect of all this publicity was that politicians threatened measures that could fundamentally alter the long-term fortunes of the private equity industry.In its journey from private to public, Blackstone – which has assets of more than $80bn and owns companies in virtually every sector and continent – has had to overcome both philosophical contradictions and concrete obstacles.Mr Schwarzman, for one, was uncharacteristically shy on the benefits of going public. Although speculation had been mounting on Wall Street this year that the private equity boom would lead several of the top firms to go public, he originally appeared to quash talk about Blackstone’s intentions.As early as February he told a high-profile private equity conference in Frankfurt that equity markets were “overrated”.Three weeks later, Blackstone filed its IPO documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, opening up a palette of reactions from a stunned corporate America.Some admired the innovative structure of the deal – a publicly traded partnership with less stringent corporate governance rules that enabled Blackstone to tap the public markets without giving up too much control. But others were puzzled. How could Mr Schwarzman attack the short-termism of US public companies, persuading chief executives to go private to avoid the strangling regulation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, while submitting himself to the same treatment?With Blackstone gagged by SEC rules, some experts concluded that by going public, the firm was calling the top of the private equity boom. With interest rates moving higher and conditions for the financing of highly leveraged takeovers worsening, Mr Schwarzman and other Blackstone executives were cashing in their chips, leaving public investors holding the cards.“We are at, or very near, a cyclical peak,” argues Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. “Smart people don’t sell when they think they are undervalued.”The debate continued through April and May as Robert Friedman, Blackstone’s chief legal officer, negotiated with the SEC’s corporate finance division over the details of the prospectus. People close to the process say it was the most intense and complex IPO review the agency has undertaken since the Google flotation in the summer of 2004.Meanwhile, as Blackstone was locked in talks with the SEC, its China executives were hatching a top-secret deal.In late May, Beijing surprised the financial world when it announced that it would invest $3bn of its vast and growing foreign exchange reserves in a 10 per cent non-voting stake in Blackstone. The Chinese involvement nearly doubled the size of the IPO overnight and won Blackstone a powerful backer in an important market.But Mr Schwarzman and colleagues had little time to celebrate. Shortly after the Beijing deal, Blackstone suffered a significant setback, being forced to abandon a controversial accounting method that allowed it to boost profits by booking revenues from deals in advance. The plan, which even attracted comparisons to the accounting methods used by Enron, the collapsed US energy group, was abandoned after investment banking analysts involved in the offering refused to endorse it, people familiar with the matter say.A bigger problem – and one that could still come back to haunt Blackstone – has been the waning health of global credit markets. As US Treasury yields began to move sharply higher in June, many on Wall Street began to listen to the bears who believe that the benign market conditions behind the private equity boom are coming to an end.Any deterioration in credit markets would hit Blackstone hard, as its core business – buying companies and assets, loading them up with debt and selling them for a profit – is heavily reliant on cheap financing for takeovers.But the biggest threat to the Blackstone IPO came last week. For months, staffers on the Senate Finance Committee in Washington had been working on legislation aimed at hardening the tax regime for private equity.When Max Baucus, the panel’s Democratic chairman, and Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican member, made their move and introduced a bill a week ago, they specifically targeted Blackstone. Private equity groups that list as partnerships, they said, should pay corporation tax at 35 per cent rather than 15 per cent.Although Blackstone may be given until 2012 to comply, the enactment of such a law could reduce its valuation by as much as 20 per cent.The buzz on Wall Street was that Mr Schwarzman’s lavish lifestyle – encapsulated by a glittering 60th birthday party in February held at the gigantic Park Avenue Armory and featuring a performance by Rod Stewart – had backfired in Washington, attracting attention from politicians at a time of rising income inequality in the US.But while some investors, particularly at US mutual funds, retreated from the Blackstone IPO because of the prospect of higher taxes, the offering remained healthy. According to people familiar with the matter, the IPO book was overflowing with orders as of Wednesday night, driven by a strong appetite from investors in the Middle East, Asia and Europe.Even before today’s stock market opening, Mr Schwarzman appeared to have pulled off a remarkable coup. The risk, however, is that what is good for Blackstone’s share price in the next few months may be harmful to the long-term future of the private equity industry.Critics accuse Blackstone of putting private equity on to the radar screen of politicians, regulators and trade unions without doing enough to allay the fears and secure the backing of such crucial constituencies.Many experts believe that if the two senators’ tax proposal becomes law, it would kill off any plans other buy-out groups – such as Carlyle, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group – might have had to list.That, in turn, would stunt the growth of the US private equity industry by hampering its drive to use stock market funds to cushion the impact of volatile fundraising and dealmaking cycles. Worse still for America’s financial clout, KKR and others might decide to list abroad, further damaging US capital markets at a time when they are competing fiercely with European and Asian exchanges for the world’s largest IPOs.“There is no shortage of historical examples of once profitable industries screwed up by over-eager regulators and politicians,” warns a senior Wall Street banker. “The taxation issue is a big threat for the industry: if the proposals go through, private equity would be considerably less attractive to investors.”A second, unintended, consequence of the publicity surrounding the Blackstone listing has been to awaken America’s unions to the perils of private equity.After months in which they refrained from following their European counterparts on the warpath against private equity – partly because union pension funds invest in buy-out funds – America’s labour representatives have sprung into action.The unions’ higher-level scrutiny ranges from detailed reviews of individual effects on workers (one grouping, the SEIU service workers’ union, now publishes a critical blog on every large deal) to a vociferous campaign against the Blackstone IPO.The battle against Blackstone has been led by the AFL-CIO, the largest union federation in the US. It has lobbied regulators and politicians to block the listing, saying it falls foul of investment laws – an allegation denied by people close to Blackstone.Damon Silvers, the AFL-CIO’s associate general counsel, argues that a failure properly to police Blackstone’s IPO could significantly damage both investors in its shares and workers in its portfolio companies.“Blackstone is trying to push the IPO out of the door before the public scrutiny heats up,” he says. “They are trying to bum-rush the regulators.”Even if the unions – a weakened force in US capitalism – have failed to sabotage the listing, their concerns speak of a wider public unease at the wealth being accumulated by the new masters of the financial universe.As America grapples with a yawning gap between rich and poor, buy-out executives have not dispelled the public perception of a clubby industry of jet-setting billionaires who grow rich by cutting costs and making workers redundant.The large buy-out funds did set up a Washington lobby group – the Private Equity Council – but the organisation has yet to make a strong public case on the economic efficiencies and financial benefits produced by private equity.On the crucial issue of taxation, for example, the council has failed to take a position – raising suspicions that some of its members, which include Carlyle, KKR and TPG, do not mind seeing Blackstone being put through the regulatory wringer.Investors in today’s listing will be hoping that several years from now, they will share Mr Keith’s quiet satisfaction at having backed a winner, rather than his original doubts about participating in an ill-fated venture.A banking flotilla offers safe passageBy Ben WhiteWhen Blackstone Group filed papers for its initial public offering, two words were conspicuously missing from the prospectus: Goldman Sachs.Despite early reports that Goldman was working on the deal, the vaunted Wall Street investment bank was not listed among the underwriters.The rumours began to fly. Goldman had been snubbed, it was said, because its private equity arm competed with Blackstone on too many deals, angering Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone chief executive; Goldman had refused to sign on because it viewed Blackstone’s proposed $32bn (£16bn, €24bn) valuation as far too high; Goldman was working on a competitor’s IPO and so had a conflict of interest.None of these privately uttered explanations was ever verified publicly as fact – and, with little fanfare, Goldman appeared on the list of underwriters when Blackstone updated its prospectus a few days ago. JPMorgan Chase, which had also been excluded from the original list, appeared as well. In total, 17 banks were listed as underwriting the IPO, ranging from the giant Citigroup to Sweden’s SEB Enskilda.One person close to the Blackstone IPO says keeping Goldman off such a long list would have been a slight likely to damage permanently relations between the two. While Goldman has clashed with Blackstone in the past, the bank is widely viewed as too powerful in the capital markets to have as a sworn enemy.Critics of Blackstone offer another view for why Goldman and others were added to the list even though Blackstone is selling only about 153m units in a flotation expected to raise up to $4.8bn. With all these banks listed as underwriters, this theory goes, none will be keen to criticise Blackstone’s valuation once the units begin trading on the open market on Friday.The valuation question is especially sensitive now that Blackstone’s bottom line has come under threat from a proposal, gaining momentum in the US Congress, that could raise its tax rate by more than 20 percentage points. Blackstone is also contending with a shaky market that has seen interest rates move up. That could make it harder for the buy-out group to raise the cheap debt that fuels its deals.All of this could call into question Blackstone’s proposed valuation, which is about 26 times last year’s pro-forma economic net income. That price/earnings ratio would rise if, as expected, Blackstone’s units jump in their first few days of trading.Wall Street analysts would be expected to point this out – but might be less inclined to do so for fear that the units could plunge in value, embarrassing their bank’s underwriters.Putting everyone on the underwriting list could also discourage the kind of sabotage attempts that Vonage, the internet telephony group, says were launched against its IPO by banks not on the deal team, after trading began.There are, of course, far less conspiratorial reasons for Blackstone to put together a list of banks nearly twice as long as that used by Fortress Investment Group, the big US hedge fund and private equity group that went public earlier this year. For instance, Blackstone and its advisers say demand for the units has been intense, with investors clamouring for nearly 800m units, six times as many as there are available.Demand is said to have been especially heavy from investors in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. That means Blackstone needs banks with global reach, such as Citigroup, and local contacts, such as SEB Enskilda, to put the units into such diverse hands.For the banks, there is ample motivation to get on the Blackstone underwriter list, even with a marginal role. To be left off one of the most prominent deals of the decade would be embarrassing. It would also impact on a bank’s standing in the closely watched underwriting league tables.However, if the sceptics prove to be correct and a change in the market environment and investor sentiment leads to a big drop in the price of Blackstone’s units in a few months, there will be a lot of embarrassed underwriters across Wall Street and beyond.But there is also safety in numbers there. With so many banks taking part, it will be impossible for any of them to seek the moral high ground in the months and years to come and say they stayed away because they knew Blackstone was wildly overvalued. In this deal, everyone is pretty much in the same boat."
148;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2007-06-06T21:31:50Z;Prudential Financial closes US division;;Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, on Wednesday said it was closing its US equity research, sales and trading operation with the loss of about 420 jobs in the biggest exit from the institutional equities broking business in recent years.Prudential said the operation, while profitable, did not have the scale to succeed in the long term.The company declined to comment on reports that it had been trying to find a buyer for the business.“Research and trading markets are really competitive and are not an area where we will be able to achieve scale to give us success,” the company said.The closure affects staff in nine US cities and four overseas centres including London, where about 25 staff sell US research under the Bache Equities name.Observers have been predicting consolidation in the sector ever since the stock market bubble burst in 2000. But many medium-sized brokerages have persevered in spite of modest profitability.In 2002, ABN Amro closed its US institutional equities arm with the loss of 250 jobs.Two years ago, Wells Fargo closed its much smaller operation.Last year, Prudential Equity Group made $34m before tax on revenue of $260m and managed assets of $137m.Prudential entered the equities business in 1981 when it acquired brokerage Bache Halsey Stuart Shields and formed Prudential-Bache Securities.In 2003, it sold the large retail brokerage operations to Wachovia in return for a 38 per cent stake in enlarged operations renamed Wachovia Securities.Last week, Wachovia agreed to buy AG Edwards for $6.8bn in a move that will make Wachovia Securities the biggest US retail broker after Merrill Lynch.Prudential promoted its equity research on the basis that it had no investment banking operations and was therefore free of conflicts.Leading Wall Street firms had settled charges of biased research in 2003.But it struggled to make inroads on the top Wall Street banks and suffered as commission rates declined with the growth in electronic trading.Prudential Equity suffered a blow in March when one of its top analysts, Mike Mayo, moved with his five-strong team of bank and brokerage analysts to Deutsche Bank.Their departure left the business with about 30 senior analysts covering about 50 sectors.Ed Keon, the unit’s chief investment strategist, and some of his team will move to Prudential’s asset management arm.
149;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2007-03-20T22:50:33Z;Mayo and team quit Prudential for Deutsche;;Mike Mayo, one of the best-known financial services analysts on Wall Street, is transfering his combative and fiercely independent style from Prudential Equity Group to Deutsche Bank.Mr Mayo, who last year had a very public spat with Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, is taking his team of five across to Deutsche where he will head all its US bank and brokerage coverage.After six years at Prudential, Mr Mayo said the move to Deutsche would offer “a great platform that can leverage our research even more”.For Deutsche, the team fills a big gap in its US equities coverage. It has had no analysts following the US banks and investment banks since Richard Strauss and Tom McCandless left two years ago.Mr Mayo has been a cheerleader for the value of sell-side research which has been under mounting pressure since the reforms of 2003 which forced investment banks to separate their research and investment banking businesses.In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee in 2002, Mr Mayo said that the pressure analysts came under from the companies they covered could be worse than that related to their employers’ investment banking relationships.In addition to Mr Mayo, the team includes Rob Rutschow, Matt Fischer and Chris Spahr.
150;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-12-12T23:15:25Z;Blurred picture for flat-screen makers;;"The flat-screen business has never been an easy one. In recent years Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese manufacturers of liquid crystal display screens have poured billions of dollars into high-technology plants, while watching the prices these screens can attract fall.In spite of booming sales of LCD televisions and expectations of further growth, every prediction that prices have bottomed out seems to have been followed by another decline.So Tuesday’s confirmation that the world’s leading LCD panel makers are facing antitrust investigations in three countries– South Korea, Japan and the US – will cast another cloud on the outlook for the industry.“It will be a long-running investigation, which could take several years,” says Brian Park, analyst at Prudential Financial in Seoul. “And it will be difficult to prove whether they are guilty of price-fixing charges, as the authorities are looking into what might have happened several years ago.”For LG Philips, which was until recently the world’s largest producer of flat screens, the inquiry is just the latest bad news that has seen its share price tumble almost as fast as its profits.The investigation could hardly come at a worse time for the Korean-Dutch joint venture, which has spent Won5,300bn ($5.7bn) building the world’s first seventh-generation plant – at Paju, north of Seoul – and in January it began churning out 42-inch and 47-inch TV panels.The group now appears to have been too ambitious; it has suffered two consecutive quarters of losses and executives are now having to rethink their plans.For rival Samsung, which has overtaken LG Philips to take the industry’s top spot, the investigation represents a further blow to its reputation, coming shortly after another high-profile price-fixing inquiry.In October two Samsung vice-presidents were indicted – along with a Hynix Semiconductor official – on price-fixing charges in the computer memory chip business, as part of a long-running antitrust investigation by the US Department of Justice.Samsung pleaded guilty last year and paid a $300m fine for its role in the conspiracy that took place between April 2001 and June 2002. Hynix paid $185m in 2004, while Germany’s Infineon Technologies paid $160m in fines in 2003.However, Samsung is having more success in the LCD industry, through its joint venture with Sony. It is making profits from the business and has been upbeat about the outlook for LCDs, saying recently that the fourth quarter was looking better than first thought.The latest investigation also involves AU Optronics of Taiwan, the world’s third-largest LCD panel maker, as well as Sharp, Japan’s largest producer of LCD panels. Also saying on Tuesday that they were in contact with regulators were Chi Mei Optoelectronics of Taiwan and Sanyo Epson, the Japanese joint venture between Sanyo and Seiko Epson.Because the scope of the investigation is not yet known, analysts said it was too early to gauge what impact the inquiry could have on the companies.Bhavin Shah, head of technology research at JPMorgan, said that, although it was too early for a clear judgement, it was unlikely the probes would be as damaging as the investigations into the memory chip industry. “In terms of revenues and profitability, the LCD industry is in much better shape than the D-Ram industry was back then,” Mr Shah said. Therefore there was less incentive for price fixing in the flat panel industry now, he said.But some said the fines could be much bigger than the amount Samsung and Hynix had to pay for their roles in the collusion to fix memory chip prices, considering the huge sales that LCD makers reported during the industry upturn in 2003 and 2004.LG Philips reported about Won6,000bn and Won8,000bn in 2003 and 2004 sales. Samsung’s LCD division reported sales of Won8,690bn in 2004 but it has not reported figures for 2003.Sharp, which is a large producer of LCD panels for use in a variety of products from mobile phones and handheld video games to flat-screen TVs, has said it expects its panel division to log full-year sales in fiscal 2006 of more than Y1,000bn.However, flat-screen makers have recently been struggling amid falling prices and tighter margins caused by a global oversupply of panels, a phenomenon that has not been offset by rising demand.Lehman Brothers predicts that a rebound in LCD prices experienced in the third quarter is now over and that the industry will hit its real bottom in the second quarter of next year.Meanwhile, over-investment in new-generation production plants is exp­ected to aggravate losses, with companies unlikely to recoup their investments for some time to come, Lehman analysts said in a recent research report."
151;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-11-23T09:08:15Z;Kookmin fails in bid for KEB;;Kookmin Bank pledged to pursue its ambitious expansion plans through organic growth yesterday, after South Korea’s largest lender saw its deal to buy Korea Exchange Bank fall through.Lone Star, the US buy-out fund, terminated the contract to sell KEB to Kookmin yesterday, signalling the end – at least for now – of a Won6,950bn ($7.5bn) deal.The announcement came as a blow to Kookmin, which is strong in retail banking and counts almost half of Koreans as customers, but which wanted to use KEB to develop its commercial business and expand abroad, particularly in Asia.“We’ve internally drawn up various alternatives for our own organic growth, beyond the acquisition of KEB, so we will make all efforts to carry out the options,” Kang Chung-won, Kookmin’s chief executive, told a news conference last night.However, he said Kookmin might consider bidding for KEB if the bank were put up for sale again. The termination of the deal comes amid widening investigations into alleged wrongdoing when Lone Star bought the distressed KEB in 2003.Announcing the termination of the deal yesterday, John Grayken, Lone Star chairman, expressed regret to Kookmin that the deal could not be consummated.“We have concluded that we cannot move forward with the sale of KEB to Kookmin Bank due to the continuing investigations surrounding Lone Star’s investment in KEB and KEB’s subsequent rescue of its credit card subsidiary, which have been extended several times and now have no firm completion date,” he said in a statement.“Once the investigation is finally completed, we will again consider our strategic options. Until then, we will continue to vigorously defend our company and our officers against the prosecutors’ groundless accusations,” he said.Among the prosecutors’ allegations are charges that KEB manipulated the share price of KEB’s credit card subsidiary, causing Won22bn in losses to shareholders. KEB yesterday pledged to carry on with business as usual.The termination of the contract came after the market closed. KEB shares fell 1.6 per cent to Won12,650 and Kookmin dropped 0.1 per cent to close at Won73,400.Sung Byung-soo, an analyst at Prudential Financial, said Kookmin could bid again for KEB, and would have an advantage because it has completed due diligence.The deal’s collapse will also hurt South Korea’s reputation among foreign investors as foreign bankers complain anyone taking risk cannot be assured of repatriating rewards.Prosecutors last week succeeded in winning warrants to arrest Ellis Short and Mike Thomson, Lone Star’s vice-chairman and legal adviser respectively, on charges they colluded in manipulating the share price of KEB Card, the bank’s subsidiary. Both deny wrongdoing. Prosecutors seek to extradite them to Korea for questioning.South Korean prosecutors filed stock manipulation charges against Lone Star and KEB, alleging the US fund made Won22.6bn ($24m) in illegal profits when it bought into the bank in 2003. This followed the KEB Card stock price manipulation allegations and accusations - since dismissed - that the fund doctored the bank’s capital adequacy ratio.Kookmin in June agreed to buy a 70 per cent stake in KEB, 51 per cent of it from Lone Star, for Won6,950bn, on condition no criminality was uncovered by the probe.But the prosecutors’ repeated delays caused the sale contract to expire in September and negotiations about renewal became mired in uncertainty as Lone Star sought a higher price - reflecting the bank’s better finances - and Kookmin insisted the delays were not its fault.
152;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-08-28T20:32:41Z;Prudential admits fraud scheme;;"Prudential Financial, one of the largest US life insurers, admitted a former unit engaged in a scheme to defraud mutual funds and their shareholders on behalf of hedge fund clients, and agreed to pay a $600m fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement announced on Monday by prosecuters.The Justice Department said the fine marked the biggest settlement to date in the elaborate scandal that was first unveiled three years ago by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, in which a handful of companies were accused of using abusive market timing trading to generate profits for clients and hefty commissions for brokers.The Justice Department said on Monday that senior managers at Prudential Securities – a former subsidiary of Prudential Equity Group – had repeatedly been made aware of the deceptive practices of some brokers, but ignored the warnings and continued to issue those brokers’ additional accounts. The scheme, which dated back to 1999 and continued to 2003, generated $100m in profits for seven of the brokerage’s clients and more than $50m in ill-gotten commissions, the DoJ said.Three executives have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and prosecutors on Monday said their criminal investigation into the conduct of other individuals and entities was continuing. Citing the ongoing probe, deputy attorney general Paul McNulty declined to comment on whether the hedge fund clients who benefited from the illicit trading knew about the scheme.“Investors were dealt a bad hand by corporate conmen who stacked the deck against them. This resolution sends a strong message to predatory traders who dupe the system to reap millions in illegal profits,” Mr McNulty said.Over the past four quarters, Prudential took charges to build up a reserve to pay for estimated settlement costs related to the market timing litigation; according to analysts the $600m settlement approximates the reserve the company created.Stewart Johnson, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, the investment bank, said Monday’s announcement “lifted a cloud of uncertainty” that had dogged the company. “The timing of the settlement was really the big unknown. I like Pru, but the [Justice Department probe] made earnings unpredictable,” he said.Under the terms of the agreement, Prudential will pay $270m to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $300m to the US Treasury, $25m to the US Postal Inspection Service, which assisted in the probe, and a $5m civil penalty to the state of Massachusetts. Prudential has also vowed to assist in the DoJ’s ongoing investigation, including an agreement to waive attorney-client privilege for documents related to the fraudulent behaviour. The deferred prosecution agreement also calls on the company’s general counsel to make periodic reports to the board’s audit committee and the US attorney in Massachusetts about the effectiveness of the compliance agreement."

After the bell on Wednesday, the coffee chain reported a 16 per cent rise in third-quarter profits. However, sales growth for July fell below levels from a year ago due to staffing problems as consumers ordered more labour-intensive iced drinks.Procter & Gamble added 2 per cent to $59.45 after rival consumer products group Unilever disappointed analysts with lower margins.Prudential Financial slid 5.9 per cent to $73.66 after it missed analyst estimates and reported a 43 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings due to falling income at its insurance division.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.72 points, at 1,280.27, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent, or 13.53 points, at 2,092.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 42.66 points, at 11,242.59.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach believes two factors helped pull the major indices back into positive territory.“There was some short covering ahead of tomorrow’s [Friday] employment data. There also seems to be some good indications that the Middle East violence might be coming to an end.”Technology staged a rally. Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.3 per cent to $20.45 following a bullish analyst comment on the stock, while Ebay added 4.7 per cent to $24.07.

Nordstrom gained 6.8 per cent to $35.62 and Limited added 5.4 per cent to $25.81.However, the real drag on the consumer sector was in casino stocks. Las Vegas Sands posted solid profit growth thanks to a strong performance at its Macau casino, but revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, pushing shares down 6.9 per cent to $60.81.MGM Mirage also sold off, losing 7.1 per cent to $35.31, after second-quarter earnings fell shy of Wall Street forecasts.
154;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-07-16T23:40:06Z;Foreign exchange trading set for shake-up;;A group of some of Wall Street’s largest banks, several hedge funds and trading firms, have signed up to participate in FXMarketSpace, a nascent joint venture which aims to be the world’s first centrally cleared foreign exchange marketplace.The platform, a joint venture between Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will be based on the CME’s exchange market which until now has been foreign to the counter FX market.It aims to address the problem of counterparty risk – the danger that one side fails to make good on their side of the trade – long an issue for the FX market. Currencies are traded bilaterally, meaning participants need individual credit lines with everyone with whom they wish to trade.Banks and prime brokers that have agreed to participate include AIG, ABN Amro, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Fimat, HSBC, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Prudential Financial/Bache Financial, RBS, Société Générale and UBS.Other financial institutions, including investment management, hedge funds and proprietary trading firms, are also well represented in the new platform, with participants such as Allston Trading, Citadel, Gelber Group, Penson Worldwide and RGM Advisors.Mark Robson, chief executive-designate of FXMarketSpace, said: “This early support confirms the market’s readiness for a more open, transparent, and efficient global FX trading platform and FXMarketSpace’s ability to deliver on that order.”Justin Foley, head of FX at Gelber Group, said: “We think the chance for a significant shift in how the FX market operates is greatly enhanced via this venture.”Aiming for a 2007 launch, FXMarketSpace will be the world’s first centrally cleared electronic trading platform for the cash FX market.It will provide credit-efficient access to the over-the-counter FX market, order book transparency and anonymity to market participants. The platform is eventually expected to offer a full breadth of FX capabilities including spot, forwards and options.Formation of the joint venture remains subject to Reuters shareholder approval.
155;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-05-18T23:12:10Z;Milberg Weiss attorneys indicted for conspiracy;;Milberg Weiss, one of the most powerful class-action law firms in the US, and two of its top attorneys were indicted on Thursday on charges of conspiracy, money laundering and racketeering, marking the culmination of a six-year investigation into a firm that has secured more than $45bn in settlements for its clients.At the heart of the charges against the firm - made by the US attorney’s office in Los Angeles - are allegations that Milberg and two of its partners, David Bershad and Steven Schulman, bribed clients to get them to agree to act as plaintiffs in their lawsuits. The charges contend that Milberg gave kickbacks to clients from 1981 through 2004, including one former client, Seymour Lazar, who served, along with members of his family, as a plaintiff in about 70 Milberg lawsuits in exchange for $2.4m.Milberg Weiss did not return a call for comment.The ability of Milberg to secure big settlements with a range of companies over the years, including Prudential Insurance, Lucent and Rite-Aid, helped it earn the wrath of legislators in Washington, who passed legislation in the 1990s to help curb class-action suits.The charges will likely put a spotlight on the firm’s founder, Melvyn Weiss, who was one of the first attorneys to use a 1966 Supreme Court ruling that made it easier for individuals to file suit together to bring securities class-action suits.The 20-count indictment represents a sea change in the Justice Department’s handling of white-collar crime and law firms. While the spate of corporate scandals in recent years resulted in numerous indictments of individual executives, and one of the world’s biggest auditing firms, Andersen, prosecutors have never sought the criminal prosecution of the firms involved in those cases.Milberg Weiss will be allowed to continue practising while it moves ahead to fight the charges, but the investigation and speculation about a possible indictment have already raised questions about the company’s ability to represent clients.A report in the Wall Street Journal this week suggested that the decision by federal prosecutors to indict the firm, a move that represents the most extreme action law enforcement can take against a company, stemmed from the firm’s refusal after weeks of negotiations to waive attorney-client privilege, or the right to protect communications between corporate lawyers and their clients. Prosecutors also insisted that the firm hand over internal documents.Milberg Weiss’s refusal to meet the government’s demands on the issue underscore a wider debate in the legal community about whether the Justice Department’s tactics in prosecuting white-collar crime violate the constitutional rights of defendants.
156;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-04-21T13:11:31Z;JPMorgan to pay $425m in IPO lawsuit;;JPMorgan has agreed to pay $425m to settle a lawsuit alleging it manipulated the market for initial public offerings during the technology boom of the late 1990s, the bank said on Thursday.The deal is the first in the case and could put pressure on other Wall Street banks to pay billions in aggregate.The eventual overall settlement is likely to be the largest private recovery for investors burned by Wall Street’s aggressive tactics during the bull market.“It’s the first breakthrough with the underwriters,” said Melvyn Weiss, partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, the law firm representing the investors who brought the case. Milberg Weiss is the most prominent class action law firm in the US, best known for winning settlements against Prudential Insurance, Swiss banks, and Drexel Burnham Lambert.Mr Weiss added that JPMorgan was lead underwriter in only 11 of 191 IPOs covered by the case in which it was involved, suggesting other banks could have to make bigger settlements.The lawsuit targeted other banks including Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, alleging they rigged IPOs, pushing investors to pay excessive commissions to get allocations of shares.In addition, the suit alleges that stock analysts employed by the banks had undisclosed conflicts of interest and made “buy recommendations” for shares, helping to artificially inflate prices.Joe Evangelisti, spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed that an agreement had been reached in principle. “There would be no adverse effect on our financial results,” he said.The deal has to be agreed with all the plaintiffs and by the court before it can be finalised, according to Mr Weiss. “It’s far off,” he said.The development in the lawsuit against the Wall Street banks follows a ground-breaking 2003 settlement that called for more than 300 companies that went public in the late 1990s and their insurers to pay $1bn to investors.The companies will not have to pay anything, however, if Milberg Weiss can get more than $1bn from the dozens of investment banks that underwrote the IPOs and are named in the lawsuit.The issuing companies could even receive compensation if the banks end up paying more than $5bn altogether.At the time, legal analysts estimated that Wall Street could end up paying more than that to settle the lawsuit.“[The JPMorgan settlement] doesn’t add much new money because we have the $1bn guarantee from the issuer settlement,” said Mr Weiss. “I think it gives a lot of psychological cover for the other banks to now come to the table.”
157;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-03-30T20:37:37Z;BoNY and JPMorgan in banking talks;;Bank of New York, the oldest bank in the US, is in talks to dispose of most of its banking arm to JPMorgan Chase, in order to focus on its larger securities processing business.The move would bolster JPMorgan’s market-leading position in retail banking in New York City and, more importantly, in surrounding suburban areas.The deal could involve Bank of New York swapping its retail bank, which analysts value at more than $4bn, for some of JPMorgan’s securities services arm to avoid a big capital gains tax hit.Bank of New York has long been expected to sell its retail arm to concentrate on securities processing, where it is one of the world’s leading suppliers, and investment management.Speculation increased in recent weeks following Capital One’s $14.6bn acquisition of North Fork Bancorp which highlighted the value of banks in the New York area. Bank of New York, which was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Treasury secretary in George Washington’s first cabinet, has struggled to grow its retail bank in recent years, marring a good performance from its processing business.The shares were up 4 per cent at $35.78 at noon in New York, valuing it at more than $27bn, following a report of the talks on CNBC. JPMorgan is the retail banking market leader in New York City, but is weaker in suburban areas in New Jersey and Connecticut where Bank of New York has most of its 342 branches.The New York market is competitive, with Bank of America and Wachovia investing in new branches to compete with JPMorgan, Citigroup, HSBC and regional banks, including Bank of New York, North Fork and Commerce. Despite despite the competition, the leading banks make good returns.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, has made clear his determination to protect its position as market leader. Bank of New York’s business, with 600,000 retail customers and 100,000 small and medium-sized business clients, is worth about $4bn, according to Mike Mayo, a Prudential Financial analyst, based on 13 times 2006 earnings of $293m. It had deposits of $15.7bn at end 2005 or about 3 per cent of the New York total.

This will see it spend ?1.8bn in share buy-backs and ?2.3bn to buy out the listed minorities in operations in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and part of a business in Israel.?There is no way that Generali could contemplate going for the Pru while it is doing that,? says Mr Yates.Allianz, meanwhile is also thought to be unlikely to get involved. Michael Diekmann, Allianz?s chief executive, told analysts last week that the group did not plan any ?major acquisitions?.The European insurer considered most likely to launch a counterbid for Prudential is Axa, the French group chaired by Henri de Castries that has a market capitalisation of ?54.3bn.According to Erwan du Halgouet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, Axa generates about ?2bn of excess capital a year for acquisitions and could afford to leverage its balance sheet by taking on ?4bn-?5bn more debt to fund a deal, taking its total ?cash war chest? to about ?5bn-?6bn. Axa?s gearing fell from 42 to 38 per cent in 2005.Mr Yates estimates that Axa could come up with ?3bn-?4bn in cash.?This does not even begin to scratch the surface of a Pru deal,? he says.Axa may also be limited in its ability to offer its own shares because UK institutions would be unwilling to hold Axa paper. It would therefore require a large rights issue to fund a purchase of the Pru.Mr du Halgouet says it would take Axa ?many years to make a Prudential deal earnings-accretive under IFRS?.He adds that the French group is valued at 12 to 13 times its 2006 earnings under the new accounting standard, against about 25 times for Prudential.Analysts also point out that in the past, Axa has tended to buy underperforming assets with strong recovery potential. It also does not like becoming involved in contested bid situations or auctions.Mr du Halgouet says Axa has more attractive alternatives, such as buying out the minority shareholders in its Asia-Pacific subsidiary or waiting for an opportunity to bid for Generali in Italy. Axa is ?not under pressure to do a defensive merger,? he says.Despite this, Axa will almost certainly be considering its position. It is one thing to talk hypothetically about the prospect of a much stronger rival, than to be actually faced with it. And, according to Mr Yates, the picture could change.?If the Aviva share price collapses because Aviva shareholders suddenly lost confidence in the proposals and that pulled the rug from under the feet of Aviva, then you may see Axa showing a bit of interest,? he says. Axa could become a ?white knight?.US suitors cannot be ruled out either.American International Group, with a market capitalisation of $177bn (?100bn), could be a potential bidder. However, it has been the subject of a series of US regulatory probes and last year corrected inaccuracies in its financial reporting.It would not comment yesterday, but according to one New-York based analyst, ?AIG normally would be interested, but considering everything that has been going on, mergers are not their main priority.? He estimates that AIG had $50bn-$60bn of acquisition firepower but would be reluctant to use it at the moment. ?If they wanted to do a $20bn-$30bn acquisition they could, I just don?t think right now, because the stock is beaten up, and they don?t have a lot of cash flexibility at this point because of the ratings agencies.?AIG lost its prized AAA rating last year and, according to the analyst, some agencies still have it on watch with negative implications. ?Their goal is they want to avoid another downgrade,? he says. ?Buying Prudential could make them have another downgrade.?He adds that Prudential would be too large a morsel for Prudential Financial, the British group?s unrelated US namesake, which has a market capitalisation of $38bn.One wild card is Manulife of Canada, with a market capitalisation of about C$59bn (?30bn). Prudential?s Asian assets would fit with its portfolio in this continent, while it could absorb Jackson National Life, Prudential?s US life assurance business.Mr Cizdyn says Aviva, by showing its hand, has also put itself into play. By approaching Prudential, he says, it has effectively admitted that it lacks growth opportunities or does not have a lot of growth potential. But according to Mr Yates, if a counterbid for Prudential is unlikely, so is an approach for Aviva.?Clearly if Aviva were to destroy its own share price by coming up with some absurdly high offer, that is different,? he says. ?But I think Aviva are far too bright to do that.?
159;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Prudential rejects £17bn bid from rival Aviva;;Prudential, UK’s second-largest life assurer, on Monday said it had rejected a £16.8bn bid approach from its bigger rival Aviva, which is pursuing a friendly takeover.Prudential, which has expressed its desire to remain independent, said it was not in takeover talks with Aviva or any other interested party.On Monday, Sir David Clementi, Prudential chairman, said: “Last week’s strong results demonstrate the positive momentum of Prudential’s businesses and the exciting prospects evident under our new management team.”“A combination with Aviva would dilute the benefits of this growth for our shareholders. The Board does not believe the proposal is in the interests of Prudential shareholders,” he added.Aviva confirmed it approached its smaller rival last week but stressed that this was not a hostile bid and that it was only prepared to proceed with a bid on a recommended basis.“We’ve made our position very clear,” said Richard Harvey, Aviva chief executive. “Essentially it’s for shareholders to make their views known and then if appropriate for the companies to engage.”Both life assurers will court Prudential shareholders this week, amid expectations that Aviva will approach them to back the all-share proposed offer at 700p a share. Prudential shares shot up 12 per cent to 753p in early trading on Monday in anticipation of a higher bid from Aviva or a rival offer.However, Mr Harvey dampened speculation that Aviva would sweeten its bid: ”We’re certainly not in the process of entering into revised offers.”Aviva wants shareholders to put pressure on Mark Tucker, Prudential’s chief executive, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, to enter into talks on creating a £37bn British insurance group.Aviva said on Monday that it expected a combination of the two groups to result in cost savings over £320m and that Prudential shareholders would enjoy a 37 per cent rise in dividend payments, based on last year’s figures.Prudential will also be meeting its shareholders. It already had an investor roadshow planned after publishing its 2005 results on Thursday.One Prudential shareholder said he would “listen to both sides with interest”. Prudential’s relations with shareholders have sometimes been strained, although a 33 per cent increase in 2005 operating profits will have smoothed the situation.Prudential’s board met on Sunday to keep all directors informed, according to one person close to the situation.Aviva executives also met on Sunday to consider their response to Prudential’s rejection, and are considering raising the proposed price or including a cash component.Bruno Paulson, analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said: “700p will not swing it. But If Aviva can convince shareholders of both companies that the merger will create a company worth much more than the sum of the two parts, then they may not have to offer much more.”However, Aviva is thought to be reluctant to raise its price or offer more cash. It regards its proposal – a share-for-share offer at market price with a 10 per cent premium – as appropriate for a merger rather than an acquisition.But its hand could be forced by a counter-bid from an overseas insurer. Axa refused to comment but will almost certainly be considering its position.Other possibles could include Prudential Financial of the US or American International Group, the world’s most valuable insurer.Meanwhile, it is understood that any combined group would initially be led by Richard Harvey, chief executive of Aviva, rather than Mr Tucker. However, in the longer term, nothing has been ruled out. Aviva would also be keen to retain Prudential’s skills, for example in AsiaThe Financial Services Authority refused to comment on whether it would examine trades in Prudential shares on Friday. Shares in Prudential rose 7 per cent to 672p on Friday, before any announcement had been made.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt
160;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-03-19T19:30:11Z;Prudential far from happy with Aviva;;“Quote me happy” is the catchphrase for car and home insurance used by Norwich Union, the brand under which Aviva trades in the UK. Its TV ads portray ecstatic customers after they have been bowled over by Norwich Union’s competitive prices.Aviva will be hoping to have the same effect on Prudential shareholders when it makes the rounds of institutional investors this week to drum up support for its £17bn ($20.7bn) approach for Prudential.Its would like to encourage Prudential shareholders to put pressure on Mark Tucker, chief executive of the UK’s second-largest life assurer, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, to engage in discussions with Aviva on creating a £37bn insurance titan.Prudential has upset some powerful City institutions on several occasions, the last being its controversial £1bn rights issues to expand in the UK, which some saw as a strategic U-turn.But the 700p per share all-share proposal rejected by Prudential last Thursday is unlikely to bring happy smiles to Pru investors’ faces. It is only a small premium to Prudential’s share price. The shares rose 7 per cent to 672p on Friday and are expected to surge again on Monday.In addition, Prudential has delivered a stinging rebuff to Aviva’s approach, which the UK’s biggest insurer is believed to maintain is friendly.Prudential said over the weekend that it “does not consider that the proposal is in the best interests of its shareholders and has rejected it”.Aviva executives were meeting on Sunday to consider their response. It is believed that no options have been ruled out. Aviva could choose to raise its offer, or sweeten it, perhaps by adding a cash component.The 700p per share offer is unlikely to be Aviva’s final shot. However, it is believed to regard the proposal as one for a merger rather than a takeover. The proposal put forward by Aviva’s chairman Lord Sharman to Sir David Clementi, in a letter last Thursday, is understood to have been for a share-for-share exchange at market price, with a 10 per cent premium.The premium is understood to have been included to tempt Prudential to the table. In addition, any combined group would initially be led by Richard Harvey, chief executive of Aviva. The premium would therefore also help compensate Prudential’s Mark Tucker for this.Aviva is also understood to regard analysts’ estimates of the savings that could be wrung from the deal as too low, potentially delivering further upside to Prudential shareholders.Whether Aviva changes its mind will be heavily influenced by whether any counter-bidders emerge.Axa will almost certainly be considering its position. Henri de Castries, chief executive of the French insurer, recently insisted he would not be threatened by a combined Aviva/Pru. But he could see things differently when faced with a UK life assurance champion.Neither Allianz of Germany nor Generali of Italy have significant positions in UK life assurance, although Michael Diekmann, Allianz’s chief executive, told analysts last week that the group did not plan any “major acquisitions”.A move by a US insurer, such as AIG or Prudential Financial, cannot be ruled out. However, AIG has had a traumatic year after regulatory probes into its financial reporting.Aviva could also take its proposal direct to shareholders through a hostile approach. However, Mr Harvey said this month that there was a “very low probability” of Aviva making any hostile offer.Finally Aviva could sweeten its approach by more explicitly addressing the so-called “social issues”.While Aviva’s Richard Harvey would lead the group initially, nothing has been ruled out for later on.Mr Tucker’s experience of running the Asian operation would be useful to the combined group. Other areas where Prudential management’s expertise would be valuable would be in Asia and in fund management.However, Aviva will also need to keep its own shareholders on side. Giving too much value away could incur their wrath and undermine its chances of pushing through a deal.It is not just Prudential shareholders it will be hoping to “quote happy” this week.
161;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Prudential loses its Chinese fund chief;;Robert Horrocks has stepped down as chief investment officer of the Chinese fund management joint venture of Prudential, the US insurer, amid concerns over the investment performance of the company’s Chinese mutual fund.Mr Horrocks follows Paul Thompson, the company’s chief executive, who last year became the first head of a Sino-foreign fund management business to resign – reflecting the sharp decline in China’s equity markets in the past four years.Everbright Pramerica Fund Management, in which Prudential holds a 33 per cent stake, is unique among the 20 Sino-foreign fund managers, because it appointed two western investment experts to the top positions. Its local rivals have all made efforts to hire senior local managers.One Shanghai-based industry expert said: “Paul Thompson and Robert Horrocks have become a lightning rod for angry investors and nervous joint-venture partners. Having two foreign nationals at the helm of the company has created an additional layer of complexity in the joint venture.”Everbright Pramerica on Tuesday declined to comment, but company insiders said Mr Horrocks, a former executive at Schroders of the UK, was no longer working at the company. Mr Horrocks, a UK citizen who holds a PhD in Chinese history and literature, could not be reached for comment.Analysts said his departure could indicate a change in the company’s distinct investment style, which is largely computer-driven, following the recent appointment of Teh-Hsiu Fu as chief executive.Mr Fu, who previously headed the rival fund management joint venture of America International Group, has yet to unveil his restructuring plan.Analysts said the departure of Mr Thompson and Mr Horrocks was partly due to growing tensions between the joint-venture partners, although Prudential has strongly denied this.Everbright Securities, part of the Everbright Group, a Chinese conglomerate, holds a 67 per cent stake in the joint venture, formed in 2003. The business launched its first fund in July 2004, raising Rmb2.5bn ($310m).In the 17 months to the end of December last year, the Quantity Core Equity fund saw its assets under management drop by nearly half to Rmb1.3bn, due to declining equity markets and large asset withdrawals.Analysts said the fund was likely to have benefited from the recent rebound in the Chinese equity market since the beginning of this year. Attention is now likely to focus on the company’s second equity fund, which is expected to complete its fund-raising process in the next few weeks.One analyst said: “It will be interesting to see whether they can persuade China’s increasingly skittish retail investors to give them a second chance.”
162;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-02-21T18:35:58Z;Utilities light up FTSE on sector bid talk;;AstraZeneca shares bucked a falling pharmaceutical sector on Tuesday amid talk of possible bid interest from Switzerland’s Novartis.Rumour of consolidation in the sector is nothing new and the Anglo-Swedish company has in the past been seen as a target for larger rival GlaxoSmithKline. However, rumoured interest from Novartis is new.Astra has a market capitalisation of more than £41bn so any deal would not be cheap. Mike Ward, analyst at pharma specialist Code Securities, said Novartis “had not been blind to the idea of a big deal in the past” but said recent signals from the company was that it was less keen on major acquisitions.Astra shares touched £26.45 in afternoon trade before ending 1.4 per cent higher at £26.11. Glaxo fell 0.5 per cent to £14.68 while Shire Pharmaceuticals lost 1.4 per cent to 873½p.The wider market gave up an early gain of 25 points to end the session down 5.3 points at 5,857.7. Falling US markets and weak oil stocks were to blame. The FTSE 250 lost 2.1 points to 9,458.9.Carnival , the cruise operator, was the leading blue-chip faller. Its shares fell 4.5 per cent to £31.24 after Credit Suisse warned of weaker cruise bookings and said Carnival had resorted to “significantly higher” promotional activity.Rolls-Royce lost 1.9 per cent to 450p after Panmure Gordon cut its rating on the aero-engine maker from “hold to “sell”.Prudential shares hit their highest level for four years as the life assurer benefited from the strength in equities markets.Prudential’s £83bn with-profits fund produced a return of 20 per cent last year, a boost to shareholders as well as policyholders. Marcus Barnard, analyst at Société Générale, writing in a “buy” note, said that Prudential had “improving fundamentals” and a “cheap valuation with speculative appeal”.Part of that appeal is the chance of a takeover, with rival Aviva, Axa of France and US namesake Prudential Financial all seen as potential bidders.“While the market continues to undervalue Prudential, don’t assume its competitors will. Prudential is the easiest way to gain or increase exposure to the fast growing Asian markets and is particularly attractive for companies that already have UK and US exposure,” said Mr Barnard.“We believe that Prudential could be an attractive target, particularly for a large life insurer seeking to gain or increase exposure to Asia”.Prudential rose 2.1 per cent to 617½p while Aviva and Legal & General rose 1.1 per cent to 760p and 2 per cent to 131p respectively.Energy stocks were also in demand as the €29bn approach by Germany’s Eon for Endesa of Spain raised hopes of further consolidation in the sector.National Grid, which is a front runner to buy KeySpan, a US gas distributor, rose 1.2 per cent to 586p, while International Power gained 3.5 per cent to 284½p. Scottish Power, which rebuffed Eon advanced last year, rose 0.5 per cent to 576p as it was again linked with a merger with Scottish & Southern Energy, 1.4 per cent higher at £11.57.Kazakhmys and Vedanta Resources were the biggest gainers among the miners as Deutsche Bank said the pair would continue to benefit from the buoyant outlook for metal prices, particularly zinc. The stocks rose 3.5 per cent to 924p and 3 per cent to £10.40½ respectively.PartyGaming, the poker group, rose 3.6 per cent to 123p, supported by an rating upgrade to “buy” from ABN Amro. “Despite renewed regulatory pressures, PartyGaming should continue to generate growth in core activities,” ABN said.The market appeared to shrug off news of record annual profits of more than £5bn at Barclays, up 0.2 per cent to 645½p.In mid-caps, LogicaCMG rose 3.7 per cent to 191p after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to “buy” and said the computer services group had made “marked progress” with its offshore investment strategy.BBA Group, the world’s largest services provider for busienss aircraft, fell 3.8 per cent to 295¼p on news that it is likely to pursue a demerger of Fiberweb, its materials technology division, after an auction failed to attract enough bids for the business.The chairman of Aquarius Platinum took advantage of a sharp rise in the company’s shares since news of a bid for Lonmin broke on Friday by selling 10,000 shares. Aquarius lost 0.9 per cent to 661½p.
163;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2006-01-21T00:40:24Z;Rising short-term interest rates hit Citigroup;;Citigroup provided further evidence of the adverse impact of rising short-term interest rates on US banks by reporting a 3 per cent fall in underlying earnings to $5bn in the fourth quarter.Chuck Prince, chief executive, said the world’s largest financial services company had seen good customer volume growth and strong revenue increases, including 13 per cent underlying growth outside the US. But this was offset by “a challenging interest rate environment and competitive pricing conditions globally”.Revenue growth slowed to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 5 per cent rise for 2005 to $83.6bn.Mr Prince said he was confident that the actions taken to improve the US consumer business would pay off in the long term and that the prospects for many of its other businesses were good.“I think 2006 is going to be a very good year,” he said.But Mike Mayo, analyst at Prudential Financial, reduced his 2006 forecast from $4.30 to $4.20 per share to reflect continued US margin pressure. The shares fell 4.7 per cent to $45.69 in New York.For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were $19.8bn, down 1 per cent on 2004, excluding the $5bn litigation provision that year. The fourth-quarter figures benefited from a $600m pre-tax release from the reserve for legal actions related to Citigroup’s underwriting of securities for WorldCom. This followed the recent rejection of an investor claim against Citigroup that the company’s lawyers believe will reduce its exposure in other cases. However, Citigroup has increased the provision for another, unspecified, legal action by $97m before tax.In the fourth quarter, income from its global consumer businesses fell 23 per cent to $2.43bn, due to interest margin compression and a jump in US personal bankruptcies. But the corporate and investment bank was 21 per cent higher at $2.05bn, thanks to strong growth from equities, M&A and transactions services.Citigroup increased its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to 49 cents.
164;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2005-10-18T20:30:20Z;FDA blow for diabetes drug;;Approval of an important new drug for both Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck could be delayed, the companies said on Tuesday, after US regulators asked for more safety data on diabetes medicine Pargluva.The Food and Drug Administration has deemed Pargluva “approvable” but asked for more data on heart safety, according to the US drugmakers, which are working together to develop and market the drug.The companies said they would provide the FDA with additional safety data from ongoing clinical trials, but that it was unclear whether regulators wanted something more. If regulators asked for another clinical trial, it could delay approval of the treatment for Type II diabetes, a prevalent condition in which the body can not use insulin properly. US approval was expected by the end of the year.The approval process for Pargluva has been closely watched for signs that the FDA has become risk averse in the wake of recent high-profile drug safety questions, particularly with Merck’s pain drug Vioxx.It is the first so-called dual Ppar drug to help control blood sugar and control cholesterol effects in diabetics.Last month, an advisory committee recommended approval for Pargluva, provided there was a risk monitoring plan. It is key to both US drugmakers, which face years of declining profits due to loss of key drugs, particularly from patent expiries.Some analysts said Pargluva could face a commercial struggle, because its glucose control and cholesterol benefits were not overwhelming compared with related rival products.Timothy Anderson, analyst at Prudential Financial, said in a note that Pargluva’s risk/benefit profile was “a tough sell likely even when finally approved”.Shares in Bristol and Merck were little changed in New York on Monday.
165;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2005-07-14T23:23:16Z;Number two at Citigroup to step down;;The starting pistol was fired in the race to become the next chief executive of Citigroup on Thursday when Bob Willumstad announced he was stepping down as chief operating officer of the world's largest financial services company.Mr Willumstad said he would leave in September to realise a “longtime, personal goal” by seeking a chief executive post at another public company.Mr Willumstad, 59, has had talks with a number of companies, including Fannie Mae, in recent months, but said he felt “uncomfortable” doing so while in a “very full-time job”.Chuck Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, said he had greatly valued his close working relationship with Mr Willumstad but that the company was well-positioned for the transition.Mr Willumstad's post will be scrapped and Mr Prince said the group would operate without a clear number two for some time.“For the forseeable future the business heads will work with me directly,” said Mr Prince.The move “fired the starting gun” in the race to become heir apparent to Mr Prince, according to one executive.Mr Prince, 55, chief executive since 2003, has made clear he hopes to remain in the job for many years.In addition to internal candidates, Mike Mayo, analyst at Prudential Financial, said that the vacant post might be “an attractive carrot” in a potential acquisition or merger of equals. But Mr Mayo expressed concern about the degree of top management turnover at Citigroup and relative lack of operating experience among the main business heads.Mr Willumstad has been one of the key figures in the construction of what is now Citigroup by Sandy Weill over the past 20 years.Mr Weill, then chairman and chief executive, appointed Mr Willumstad his second-in-command in 2002. But when Mr Weill gave up the chief executive role two years ago the job went to Mr Prince.Mr Willumstad said he considered leaving at that point but that Mr Prince had been “really gracious” in crafting a partnership between the two.They have worked closely to tackle the series of regulatory and legal problems with which Citigroup has been embroiled, Mr Willumstad has also been involved in a number of large deals, most recently the disposal of Citigroup's asset management business to Legg Mason.

In April, Fortis entered the Turkish banking market with the €985m acquisition of Turkey’s Disbank, and has a further €4bn for acquisitions.Karel De Boeck, head of Fortis’ Commercial & Private Banking business, said of the Dryden acquisition: “It will allow us to develop a wealth management platform in the UK and Monaco and to strengthen our existing position, mainly in Asia as well as in Switzerland and the Netherlands.”Fortis said that the acquisition would have no material impact on its solvency or net profit per share and that it expected to achieve a double digit return on investment from 2008. Fortis shares rose 0.3 per cent to €22.73 in early morning trade.
167;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2005-05-30T20:58:45Z;M&A fall is blamed on regulators;;A “poisonous” regulatory environment has been one of the driving forces behind the recent collapse of merger activity in the US financial services industry, according to one of Wall Street's top dealmakers.A series of regulatory actions had made chief executives in the sector more reluctant to strike deals, said Rodgin Cohen, chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York law firm.These include the investigation by Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney-general, into discriminatory practices in the US mortgage industry, and the Federal Reserve's move to prevent Citigroup from making a large acquisition.Mr Cohen, one of the most senior American M&A lawyers who worked on Wachovia's takeover of First Union and JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of Bank One, also cited compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation as a reason potential foreign acquirers had not moved more aggressively to buy peers in the US.He explained that a number of senior executives at foreign financial services groups saw Sarbanes-Oxley as a “metaphor for a regulatory system that is overly intrusive and legally imperialistic”. The volume of deals in the US financial services industry has tumbled from $111bn in the first five months of 2004 to only $32bn so far this year, according to Thomson Financial.This year's largest transaction has been Capital One's $5.4bn acquisition of Hibernia, the Louisiana bank. By this time last year JPMorgan had already agreed its $58bn purchase of Bank One and Royal Bank of Scotland had bid $10.5bn for Charter One Financial.The regulatory environment was not the only factor behind the dearth of activity, said Mr Cohen, speaking on an investor call organised by Michael Mayo, financial services analyst at Prudential Financial.Mr Cohen said dealmaking was also being hampered by the relatively poor equity market performance of financial services groups. He also pointed to the fact that many of the largest banks have depressed price/earnings ratios compared with their smaller potential targets, what he described as “the inversion factor”. Nevertheless, Mr Cohen was optimistic about the long-term prospects for mergers and acquisitions activity in the US banking industry, which is much more fragmented than in most European countries.“I think we will see a resumption of consolidation activity. The US remains overbanked and underconcentrated by every considerable metric,” Mr Cohen said.
168;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2004-11-12T21:44:39Z;Favoured insurers ‘belonged to ULR club’;;"Mr Spitzer’s complaint, which runs to 24 pages, names as defendants ULR, Douglas Cox, its founder and chief executive, and two subsidiaries United Life Resources and Benefits Commerce.The allegations focus on “side arrangements” between ULR and a group of big insurers.The following are extracts from the main allegations quoted in the civil complaint:Main Allegations and (below) Belonging to the ULR Club; ULR ‘Betrays its Clients’:Clause 10: “According to its agreements with its client employers, ULR’s compensation for its employee benefits consulting and brokerage services generally derives from (i) a flat fee or (ii) commissions representing a percentage of the premiums paid by its client employers and their employees”Clause 11: “What the agreements have generally not disclosed, at least up until the middle of 2003, is that ULR and Cox had separate side arrangements with a group of insurers, including, among others, UnumProvident Corporation; MetLife Inc; and Prudential Financial, under which ULR and Cox have received additional payments. These arrangements - variously known as ‘special producer agreements,’ ‘quality business incentive awards,’ ‘preferred broker compensation plans,’ ‘competitive bonus programs,’ and ‘extra compensation agreements’ - are known generally as ‘overrides’. According to ULR’s financial records, in 2003, overrides accounted for $11.5m of ULR’s $25.3m in revenues.”Clause 12: “These arrangements have the potential and do, in fact, result in ULR steering business to insurers that pay overrides and withholding it from those that do not.”Clause 13: “ULR receives another form of undisclosed compensation through insurers: ‘communication fees.’ These payments, which are sometimes mandated in side agreements between ULR and the insurer, are generally for…enrollment materials…In 2003, communication fees amounted to $5.6m of ULR’s $25.3m in revenues. Together with overrides, in 2003, these undisclosed fees constituted over $17m.”Clause 14: “ULR is not the only party that profits from these side arrangements. In 2003 ULR clients and their employees paid premiums for life, accident and disability coverage in the following amounts to the following insurers: Unum $101.6m; Prudential $214.3m; and MetLife $565.6m. Insurers have found the revenues derived from the collection of premium on accounts brokered by ULR more than compensates for the payments to ULR, especially when their rates and other substantive terms are less competitive. As one udnerwriter at Unum recommended in discussing its override agreement with ULR, it was worthwhile ‘to pay a slightly higher % [of premium to ULR] for retaining profitable life cases - [since] this may be a less expensive way to maintain some of these accounts (vs going head-to-head with Met & Pru on price right now).”Clause 15: “Because insurers have benefited from their dealings with ULR, they have worked in concert with ULR to conceal these side arrangements. They have ommitted information regarding payments made to ULR from mandatory public filings; evaded client inquiries regarding ULR’s compensation; and falsified pricing for communication services to give the impression that ULR’s charges for such services are competitive. One insurer went so far as to enter into a fictitious bid to block and insurer that did not have a side arrangement with ULR from competing for business. The insurers knew that cooperating with ULR to conceal these side arrangements is a ‘quid pro quo for obtaining business brokered by ULR.”Section C: ULR Enters into Lucrative Side Arrangements with Insurers1. ULR Receives Undisclosed Override PaymentsClause 31: “ULR’s secret override payment arrangements have created potential and actual conflicts with the interests of its clients. The arrangements create extraordinary incentives for ULR to drive business to particular insurers: if a single client moves from one insurer to another, ULR could lose millions of dollars in compensation…”Clause 32: “The incentives are equally compelling for insurers, It is understood that ULR will only direct business to insurers if they participate in the override arrangements. In the words of an Unum underwriter: ‘[u]nfortunately, to play with [ULR], we need the overrides.’ As another Unum employee elaborated, Unum enters into override agreements with ULR because it represents one of the ‘biggest premium opportunities’ and Unum would get ‘0’ of that business if it did not join ULR’s club.”Clause 33: Given this perception, MetLife, the nation’s largest life insurer, paid ULR $9 million, or over 36 per cent of its $25 million override budget in 2003 - a remarkable figure given that Met had override agreements with at least 60 brokers…”Section E: ULR Steers Business to Insurers that Go Along and Cuts Out Those That Do NotClause 50: “The big payoff for insurers who participate in these arrangements is that, despite the appearance of a competitive process, they know that Cox often identifies an insurer as suited for a particular piece of business even before he issues the RFP on behalf of the client. Membership in Cox’s club puts those insurers on the inside track to the business…”Clause 53: “While favouring certain insurers, Cox simultaneously will not deal with those that will not agree to the club’s membership terms. In 2002, ULR and Minnesota Life Insurance Company reached an agreement on override payments, but Minnesota Life insisted that all of ULR’s compensation be disclosed to the client. ULR refused to enter into the agreement and declined to engage in further business with Minnesota Life.”Clause 54: Aetna Inc, one of the nation’s largest life insurers, has not had an override agreement with ULR since February 2001. Since that time, Aetna has had virtually no success in securing new business where ULR is the broker.”Section F: ULR Betrays Its ClientsClause 56: “ULR’s practices have had a detrimental impact on its clients and their employees, as set forth below:1. Viacom: ULR Conspires to Falsify Pricing DocumentClause 57: “In 2004, Viacom retained ULR in connection with renewing its group life and accident employee insurance coverage with Prudential. Through ULR, Viacom requested Prudential to provide a renewal quote. In conjunction with presenting its presentation of Prudential’s renewal quote, ULR asked Prudential to create exhibits which misrepresented that Prudential’s cost for communication services would be the same as ULR’s costs…ULR generally charges $10 per employee for communications services. In contrast, when Prudential charges for the same services, it charges #3.45 per employee, although it ordinarily absorbs the cost in its overhead. Prudential employees resusted ULR at first, but ULR insisted that Prudential provide it with false exhibits.”Clause 58: “Prudential provided ULR with false exhibits, knowing that ULR intended to pass them on to Viacom, ULR then knowingly incorporated the information contained in the exhibits into a ‘Group Life and Accident Insurance Renewal Summary’ which it provided to Viacom. The summary was misleading in that it represented that the cost of communications services would be the same whether performed by ULR or Prudential. Relying on this false and misleading information, Viacom accepted Prudential’s offer and agreed to permit ULR to perform the communications.”2. Marriott: ULR Solicits a Fictitious Quote to Squeeze Aetna Out of the Bidding ProcessClause 59: “In December 2002, Marriott International, the hotel chain, contracted with ULR to obtain both life and disability insurance for its employees, 6590 of whom reside in New York State. ULR first resisted quotes for life insurance. Under the customary procedure, the insurers submitting the three lowest quotes - the ‘finalists’ - each get the opportunity to make more detailed presentations to Marriott, in which they can revise their proposals, and the client can consider non-price factors, such as service.”Clause 60: “Unum submitted a proposal for group life insurance coverage and was accepted as one of the three finalists. Marriott then added new conditions that Unum believed would make it unprofitable for it to continue with its original bid. When Unum informed ULR of its intention to withdraw, ULR protested. If Unum were to withdraw, ULR told Unum, the incumbent carrier Aetna - which had no override agreement with ULR - would become one of the three finalists. ULR had override agreements with the other two insurers and asked Unum to maintain its bid to prevent the possibility that an insurer without an override would win the contract, Unum agreed, but only after it obtained a commitment from ULR that it need not take on business unless an undisclosed and unlikely contingency was met - that the amount of income covered under the policy would increase by one billion dollars. In other words, ULR, in order to guarantee continuing stream from overrides, solicited a bid from Unum solely to block a real competitor, Aetna, from the competition.”"
169;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2004-09-07T19:16:23Z;Game theory helps insurers judge the risks of terror;;The Bush Administration has waged its war against terror on several fronts: it has created a new Department of Homeland Security, established a Terrorist Threat Integration Center and passed the USA Patriot Act.But despite those measures some companies fear the terrorist will always get through. They have turned to the private sector for help on gauging the potential impact of future attacks.Shortly after September 11 2001, a small group of companies that specialise in assessing risk for the insurance industry launched US terrorism risk models.These combine technology and data to predict likely terrorist targets and methods of attack, and possible losses to life and property.They are aimed at the insurance and reinsurance industry, which already uses similar models to assess potential losses from natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes.“Most major commercial insurers and reinsurers are using terrorism modelling today,” says Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute.Risk Management Solutions, one of the companies that sells the models, says its models identified the Citigroup building in New York and Prudential Financial's building in New Jersey as possible targets ahead of the US government's code-orange threat alert for the financial sector last month.Andrew Coburn, director of terrorism research at RMS, says the company can pinpoint possible targets because it believes terrorists make rational decisions.“Their methods and targeting are very systematic,” he says.RMS uses game theory analytical tools designed to observe interactions among people in its models. It argues that, as security increases around prime targets, rational terrorists will seek out softer targets.Industry participants, however, say the predictive abilities of the models are limited, given the difficulty of foreshadowing human behaviour.“The probability side can't be relied on as it is with natural hazards,” says Ryan Ogaard, global practice leader of the modelling unit at Guy Carpenter, a reinsurance specialist.Still, the information the models contain is considered valuable for assessing the impact of any attack, in part because modelling com-panies have collated extensive data for their catastrophe risk models.“We've already builtdatabases of commercial buildings and residences and the people in them for the whole country,” says Jack Seaquist, terrorism product manager at AIR Worldwide.The development of the models has attracted the interest of the US government, which is using some of them in its Department of Homeland Security, according to Dennis Kuzak, senior vice-president at Eqecat.“We are in fact helping the US government get a better handle on potential risks,” he says, adding that this is an “unexpected” use of the model.How extensively the models will be used in the future remains unclear.Much depends on the fate of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which was passed in 2002 to provide federal help for any insurance losses sustained as a result of a terrorism attack.Under the act, the Treasury Department is obliged to cap insurers' liability and reimburse them for some losses.The act has enabled insurers comfortably to extend coverage to businesses, which are increasingly demanding terrorism insurance.More than 46 per cent of US businesses bought insurance to cover terrorism risks in the second quarter nearly double the rate during the same period a year before, according to Marsh, an insurance services group.The government has not yet decided whether it will extend the act. If it does not, some market participants believe the terrorism risk models could become an increasingly valuable means of underwriting terrorism insurance.But trade associations for the insurance industry say the inability of the models accurately to assess the frequency of terrorist attacks means they are not a reliable indicator of pricing the risk of catastrophic attacks.“From a severity standpoint, the total loss from a terrorist event . . . could well exceed the capacity available in the insurance industry,” the associations said in a submission to a congressional hearing on the act earlier this year.Others argue that, if the terror risk act is not extended, interest in the models might diminish because insurance com-panies could be reluctant to provide terrorism coverage at all.Meanwhile, the accuracy of the models' predictions remains in doubt.“But hopefully we'll never see them tested,” says the Insurance Information Institute's Mr Hartwig.
170;PRU;Prudential Financial Inc;2004-08-02T13:57:12Z;US stocks rise in spite of new terror fears;;Wall Street’s bulls conquered fresh terrorism fears to continue last week’s climb, as investors shrugged off worries about US government warnings that al-Qaeda was planning attacks on iconic financial institutions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by a positive earnings report from Procter & Gamble, added 0.4 per cent to 10,179.16. The S&P500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,106.62 and the Nasdaq edged up 0.3 per cent to 1,892.09.Market observers said Wall Street’s response indicated investors had adjusted to the idea of increased terror threats in the three years since the attacks of September 11 2001. John Buckingham, manager of the Al Frank Fund, noted that the government had issued warnings in the past, with no ensuing attack. “After a while you start to get a little complacent about it,” he said.Nonetheless, Wall Street has been jittery for weeks as investors have worried about terrorism, the war in Iraq and surging oil prices. But by the close, oil had eased off the morning’s highs, hit on continued worries about supply disruptions.The warning about fresh security threats from the office of homeland security over the weekend - the first to cite specific targets - named Citigroup, which has several buildings in Manhattan, and Prudential Financial in northern New Jersey, as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington.Shares in Citigroup reversed earlier losses to gain 0.5 per cent to $44.32. Prudential Financial slid 1 per cent to $46.10. Shares in other giant financial services companies were mixed, as JP Morgan Chase added 0.2 per cent to $37.41 and Merrill Lynch shed 0.1 per cent at $49.65.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble climbed 2.3 per cent to $53.34 after the household goods giant unveiled an expectation-beating 44 per cent increase in second-quarter profits.The upbeat results led the S&P 500 consumer staples group to the session’s top performance, up 1 per cent. Kimberly-Clark added 1.4 per cent to $64.98, while Clorox rose 1.2 per cent to $50.36, and Colgate-Palmolive climbed 0.3 per cent to $53.34.The consumer staples group was the weakest on the S&P500 last week, with gains of just 0.3 per cent compared with 1.4 per cent for the parent index. Owen Fitzpatrick, co-head of the US large cap growth at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said investors eased cut back on fresh cash flows to the group as they noticed its rising multiples the group now trades at a slight premium to the S&P500. But yesterday, he said, they remembered the group’s allure as a safe haven.Elsewhere, Cox Communications leapt 20.2 per cent to $33.16, after Cox Enterprises, its parent, made a $7.9bn offer to buy out the 38 per cent of the company it does not already own. The cash offer values the public shares at $32 apiece, a 16 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price. The news sent a charge through the cable sector, with Comcast up 4.9 per cent to $28.75, Cablevision Systems gaining 10.7 per cent to $19.34 and Time Warner 1 per cent higher at $16.81.In deal news, First National Bancshares of Florida leapt 36.7 per cent to $24.31 on news it would be acquired for $1.6bn by Fifth Third Bancorp. Fifth Third shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $49.16.Reynolds American climbed 3.3 per cent to $74.30 as profits more than doubled at its RJ Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, in spite of sliding sales. The holding company is the combination of the US businesses of RRJ Tobacco Holdings and Brown Williamson Tobacco, completed last week.Corinthian Colleges plunged 45 per cent to $10.29 after warning that earnings for the fourth quarter, fiscal year 2004 and 2005 will miss previous forecasts, blaming lower revenue and higher expenses. The weakness spread to the rest of the sector, sending Career Education down 12.5 per cent to $29.60 and Apollo Group 7.4 per cent lower to $77.33..
