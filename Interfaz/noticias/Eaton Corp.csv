0;ETN;Eaton Corp;2014-07-10T07:00:19Z;Diesel supply bedevils investments in Africa’s internet;;"“If you wake me up at 2 am and ask me what I am thinking about, the answer is power,” says Pankaj Kulshrestha, chief operating officer of Eaton Towers, one of a crop of infrastructure companies that have sprung up in the past five years to control some 15 per cent of Africa’s telecoms towers.Such nighttime frets arise from the fact that telecoms towers – which much of Africa relies upon to enable internet access – need diesel-powered generators to keep humming. And the supply of diesel in sub-Saharan Africa is prey to theft, political upheavals and economic volatility.As a result, the business model of “towercos” such as Kulshrestha’s, as well as the operation of some 170,000 telecoms towers and the provision of wireless internet for communications, banking and commerce in large swathes of the continent all hinge on the vicissitudes of the market in the fuel.Goldman Sachs, Soros and Rothschild are all at diesel’s mercy
“Towercos”, which have attracted high profile investors from the West such as Goldman Sachs and George Soros, operate by buying portfolios of towers from mobile phone operators and then lease back space for their transmission equipment, reducing costs for the operators while creating economies of scale by opening up the towers to sharing with rival operators.The problem is that in much of sub-Saharan Africa (aside from South Africa), the electricity supply from the grid is unreliable, necessitating the deployment of the diesel generators either as back up or, in poorly-connected rural areas, the prime source of power.The fuel is far more expensive than mains electricity and is the largest single overhead in running towers, accounting for up to 75 per cent of costs where a generator runs for 16 hours a day. In Nigeria, for example, power sourced from generators costs around $0.35 for a kilowatt-hour – four to five times the price of mains electricity.“The price spikes I worry less about, it’s more the supply,” says Kevin Koch, chief operating officer of Helios Towers Africa, which has 7,800 towers in and is backed by the funds of George Soros, Madeleine Albright and Jacob Rothschild.In Ghana, which has a comparatively high 72 per cent electricity grid access, according to World Bank figures, and up to 21 hours a day of supply, this is less of an issue for towercos.By contrast, the less-than-half of Nigerians who have mains access often only get a handful of hours of daily supply. Yet the alternative of obtaining diesel from a licensed vendor can be difficult, compounded by frequent shortages, limited refining capacity and and strikes by workers.Elsewhere, the vastness of the Democratic Republic of Congo – a land mass four times the size of France– means that while a litre of diesel costs around $1.40 in the capital, Kinshasha, in the remote interior it sells for as much as $3 to $4, says Koch.These factors have led some tower owners to hedge against fuel price increases with oil derivatives such as forward contracts, according to one advisor. More commonly, leasing agreements contain clauses that share fuel price increases with the tenants – the mobile operators. And many companies contract with several bulk suppliers to preclude shortfalls.“We hold between 800 to 1000 litres on a site so even if there’s a two-week shortage it will be OK,” adds Koch.Pilfering is not a guy with a jerry can, it is organised crime
Yet as tower sites are unmanned most of the time this makes them a prime target for fuel pilfering.“Some operators will admit they are losing a quarter of their diesel to theft,” says Terry Rhodes, co-founder of Eaton, which operates 1,500 towers across Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa. “This isn’t just a guy with a jerry can – it’s organised crime. When you get deliveries you have to make sure it’s the right amount and that it hasn’t been diluted en route”.Competition is spurring towercos to drive down costs by limiting diesel use. Many have systems that remotely monitor the level of fuel in tanks and how long generators run for. Increasingly popular are ‘hybrid’ power set-ups, comprising long-lasting deep cycle batteries that charge either from the grid or a diesel generator.Solar power may be a partial solution
“Solar panels are an option for more spacious rural sites,” says Bob Hurley of Eltek, a Norwegian Nasdaq-listed company that has developed more than 500 power systems for towers in Africa at a cost of around $30,000 each.In the long run this makes commercial sense. A study by the mobile industry body GMSA claimed that adoption of green power in Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal and Nigeria could realise annual savings of up to $200m and reduce diesel consumption by more than 70 per cent.Yet even though prices of photovoltaic panels have fallen dramatically in recent years, the initial capital expenditure involved can still be prohibitive, according to Rhodes. The economics only add up where a site is unlikely to obtain a grid connection, which delivers far cheaper electricity.Ironically, in those sparsely-populated areas the business case for renewables is even weaker. The lower density of mobile subscribers means there is less revenue per user – a factor that puts off operators from expanding network coverage in the first place.The calculus could change however, due to a combination of commercial and policy pressures giving a push away from costly diesel.Towerco deals to reach $10bn in the next three years
Perhaps the biggest driver towards greater energy efficiency is rising consumer demand. Mobile subscriptions in sub-Saharan countries have grown to 475m from 90m in seven years, but fewer than one in three Africans has a mobile phone, according to GMSA.As 3G is rolled out, some industry figures believe the number of towers needs to double.This opportunity for investment is attracting international investors such as Goldman Sachs, which participated in a $490m capital raising earlier this year deal by Nigeria-based IHS, the continent’s biggest independent towerco with 8,250 towers.Savings will also be required to fund acquisitions as mobile operators shed infrastructure assets and towercos expand their networks. Analysts estimate there will be $10bn of tower outsourcing and building deals in the next three years as high costs drive consolidation in markets with multiple mobile operators.The scramble for more towers is on
Bharti Airtel this week sold 3,100 towers to Helios for around $500m and plans to offload a further 8,000 across 12 countries in deals that could raise $1.5bn for the Indian telecoms group. Meanwhile, Eaton, Helios, IHS and rivals American Towers Corporation are battling for ownership of 11,000 towers being divested by MTN Nigeria for an estimated $1bn, in what would be the biggest deal yet in the sector.In addition, the gradual removal of government fuel subsidies – Ghana and Egypt have recently upped petrol product prices – will provide impetus towards the uptake of low-pollution fuel cells, which use the power generated when hydrogen is combined with oxygen, says Kulshrestha of Eaton, although he reckons it is “some way off”.The technology is already being deployed in India, where Intelligent Energy is installing hydrogen fuel cell powers units, originally developed to power electric cars, at 4,000 tower sites.The issue could be resolved by the roll-out and improvement of electricity grids and several governments talk big on their aims to boost generation capacity. But despite moves aimed at electrifying far-flung hinterlands – such as the privatisation of electricity utilities in Nigeria– towercos aren’t holding their breath.“We see a lot of development programmes sponsored by the World Bank pushing electrification out,” says Koch of Helios. “This year in Tanzania we have electrified 80 out of 3,000 sites. But we don’t expect the electricity company to bring the power to us.”Correction: this article originally said that Nigeria spent $6bn annually on diesel subsidies and that the fuel’s price was regulated. It has been amended to reflect the fact diesel is no longer subsidised, and the price is deregulated.Back to beyondbrics"
1;ETN;Eaton Corp;2014-02-04T18:53:17Z;Eaton shares fall as higher costs squeeze margins;;Higher-than-expected costs for new product introductions depressed fourth-quarter margins at Eaton Corporation, the power management company, and fed growing investor gloom about the US economy after disappointing January car sales figures.Eaton, which in 2012 bought Cooper Industries, a significant power systems manufacturer, nevertheless projected 2014 operating earnings – excluding $168m of acquisition charges – 14 per cent up on 2013, at between $4.50 and $4.90 a share.The shares were down 3.37 per cent at lunchtime in New York, at $67.90.Eaton said narrower margins had reduced fourth-quarter earnings per share by 7 cents compared with the company’s guidance of $1.05 a share. Higher-than-anticipated corporate expenses – a result of final accounting for the costs of the Cooper acquisition– knocked another 4 cents off the figure, although a lower-than-expected tax rate boosted the figure by 14 cents, to $1.08.Sandy Cutler, chief executive, said 4 cents of the margin shortfall came from product introduction expenses in the company’s automotive business that were $17m higher than anticipated. Another 1 cent came from the aerospace business and 2 cents from the Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services divisions.“Volumes were right where we expected them to be,” said Mr Cutler. “It really was an issue of performance in three of our businesses.”Eaton was previously forced in August to cut its 2013 forecast due to deteriorating global growth. The company makes about half its sales in the US and the rest elsewhere in the world, particularly in emerging markets.Mr Cutler said he believed investors had seen Eaton’s narrower-than-expected margins as a sign of deterioration in the US economic outlook, following Monday’s disappointing car sales figures and other indicators.However, he insisted that Eaton’s businesses had seen no significant worsening of outlook, despite a projected fall-off in US government orders and cutbacks on capital expenditure by utilities.“My quick survey of our businesses says, no, [the outlook] has not changed at all,” Mr Cutler said.Eaton’s fourth-quarter net income more than doubled, from $179m to $479m, on sales up 28 per cent, to $5.5bn. The big increase reflected the effect of the Cooper acquisition, completed on November 30 2012. Diluted earnings per share – which rose from 46 cents to $1.00 – rose less sharply than net income because of a share issue that funded the $11.8bn Cooper acquisition.Third-quarter operating profit for the vehicle division rose 30 per cent to $127m on sales up 6.8 per cent to $930m, while aerospace operating profits rose 31 per cent to $59m, on sales up 2.8 per cent to $446m. Operating profits in the core electrical products division rose 55 per cent to $276m, while operating profits for Electrical Systems and Services rose 51 per cent to $221m.
2;ETN;Eaton Corp;2013-08-02T13:50:59Z;Weak economy forces Eaton to cut forecast;;"Shares in Eaton Corporation fell 5.5 per cent after the diversified industrial company, which is heavily exposed to emerging markets, cut forecasts for the year, citing weak global growth.The company, which last year completed an $11.8bn takeover of Cooper Industries, said it was cutting its forecast for full-year earnings from a range of $4.05 to $4.45 to a range of $4.05 to $4.25.Eaton is the latest of several large US industrials to cite the challenges of a weak global economy in its second-quarter results. Caterpillar, the maker of mining and construction equipment, blamed the worldwide mining downturn when it cut its outlook for the second successive quarter. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, also said on Tuesday that 4 per cent revenue declines outside North America had partially offset 7 per cent increases in the region.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said the 38 per cent increase in second-quarter revenue, to $5.6bn, reflected 40 per cent growth from acquisitions and a 2 per cent decline in “core sales”, reflecting “soft conditions” in several of the company’s end markets.Net income was up 29 per cent compared with last year’s second quarter to $494m, while diluted earnings per share – which were depressed by the shares issued to purchase Cooper – declined 7 per cent to $1.04.Mr Cutler said Eaton had entered 2013 expecting the year to be one of “subpar” global economic growth, leading to approximately 2 to 3 per cent growth in the company’s markets. It now expected global growth of about 1 per cent.Growth in the company’s home US market had also been less focused on the company’s core industrial products than on consumer products, cars and housing, Mr Cutler said. Industrial production in the second quarter had risen only 0.1 per cent, he pointed out.“It wasn’t capital goods; it wasn’t new manufacturing plants,” Mr Cutler said. “We continue to believe that we are going to see a year where industrial production in the US will be less than GDP growth. That’s a difficult environment.”Mr Cutler added that, in the companies two biggest segments – which make electrical control equipment – demand had been strongest in the US, Middle East and Latin America and weakest in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Growth in those segments would now be about 2 percentage points lower than expected, he said.The key emerging market economies – China, India and Brazil – were “struggling to get traction”, Mr Cutler said.“They’re not growing at the rates we saw before the recession,” he said.The company’s hydraulics division fared still worse, experiencing sales growth of just 1 per cent to $772m, as a 9 per cent core sales decline and a further 1 per cent decline from currency effects all but wiped out a 10 per cent increase from acquisitions. The division’s operating profits fell 15 per cent to $104m.The shares closed down 5.5 per cent at $66.06 in New York."
3;ETN;Eaton Corp;2013-04-29T16:35:09Z;Acquisitions lift Eaton earnings;;Eaton Corporation, the diversified industrials group, beat its own forecasts for first-quarter operating earnings per share, despite declining sales in some of its key markets, including automotive.Operating earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs, were 84 cents, more than the top of the company’s previous 70 to 80 cent range, but the company maintained its full-year guidance for operating earnings of $4.05 to $4.45.The results follow last year’s $11.8bn takeover of Cooper Industries, a manufacturer of power distribution and other electrical equipment. The acquisition boosted sales and earnings in many areas but depressed earnings per share because of the shares issued to pay for the acquisition.Sandy Cutler, chief executive, said 2 cents per share of the improvement reflected the receipt this year of a tax credit for last year’s research and development expenses in the US. The rest had reflected the company’s lower-than-expected operating expenses.“Part of it was that we kept our operating expenses lower than we had expected,” Mr Cutler said. “The bigger picture was in our operating businesses around the subject of productivity paid off.”First-quarter sales of $5.3bn were 34 per cent up on last year’s first quarter. This reflected a 40 per cent increase as a result of acquisitions, offset by a 5 per cent decline in core markets and a 1 per cent fall because of currency translation, Mr Cutler said.Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders improved 22 per cent to $378m. The 84 cents operating earnings per share figure represented an 8.7 per cent fall compared with last year’s first quarter, as a result of the share issue. Earnings per share including the effect of acquisitions was down 13 per cent to 79 cents.The company had expected from the start that Europe was going to continue to be “a very difficult situation,”, Mr Cutler said. Forecasts for global GDP for the year had also been “really weak”, he added.Operating profits in the core electrical products segment were up 73 per cent to $241m, on sales up 87 per cent to $1.66bn. In electrical systems and services, operating profits nearly tripled from $76m to $210m, on sales up 79 per cent to $1.52bn.Operating profit in hydraulics fell 28 per cent to $78m. Sales for the segment improved only 3 per cent, as a 9 per cent decline in core sales and 1 per cent slide from currency translation nearly cancelled out a 13 per cent sales increase from an acquisition.In aerospace, where the company benefited from buoyant commercial demand, operating profits rose 3 per cent to $62m, on sales up 1 per cent to $434m.In the vehicle segment, where the company is exposed to the struggling European market and the declining North American truck market, operating profits fell 18 per cent to $132m, on sales down 11 per cent to $939m.The shares closed up 2.8 per cent at $60.28 on Wall Street.
4;ETN;Eaton Corp;2013-03-05T18:27:24Z;America’s truckmakers run into soft patch;;On Van Brunt Street in Brooklyn, by New York Harbour, it is easy to appreciate the role of trucks as the lifeblood of the US economy.When a ship calls at Red Hook container terminal, waiting trucks line up along the street ready to decant the contents, their radiator grilles proclaiming them “International” or “Freightliner” products. Trucks roll to and from warehouses in neighbouring streets, some belonging to YRC and Old Dominion – two of the US’s biggest truck operators.While the lifeblood continues to pump through Red Hook’s streets, the flow seems to have slowed sharply at the end of last year. John Wiehoff, chief executive of CH Robinson, a significant operator, last month told investors on its fourth-quarter conference call that December had finished “very poorly” and the beginning of January was “very weak” both in volumes and profit margins.Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton Corporation, the diversified industrial group, says the trucking weakness reflects consumers’ concerns over the potential impact of fiscal cliff tax rises and spending cuts.The question for trucking companies and truckmakers is how long-lasting the downturn will be and how severe its effects.North American truck production fell 23 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Eaton. Daimler Trucks North America, the North American truck arm of Germany’s Daimler, which makes Freightliner trucks, announced on January 30 it might lay off 1,300 workers because of the downturn.“Consumers are starting to really come to grips with what this tough economy and wage situation mean,” Mr Cutler says.The long-term picture remains far from clear. Martin Daum, chief executive of Daimler Trucks North America, says that in October he was confident the North American market for large trucks would grow further in 2013 after 2012’s 13.6 per cent year-on-year figure. But by late January he was sure 2013 would be 10 per cent down on 2012. The market has subsequently recovered slightly.“Ultimately, 2013 will be between minus 10 per cent and plus 10 per cent,” Mr Daum says. “I can’t even tell you which way.”Trucking groups’ year-end results all painted a similarly gloomy picture of demand in December. Mr Wiehoff told investors that many of CH Robinson’s customers appeared to have undertaken unusually long year-end shutdowns, followed by slower-than-normal production ramp-ups in January. Both YRC and Old Dominion Freight Line sounded similarly gloomy about December’s figures.“Our hope is that that was a big part of what we were seeing – just diminished year-end activity that carried over into January,” Mr Wiehoff says.Yet truckmakers mostly remain confident that demand will hold up better than in 2009, when year-on-year demand for trucks fell by 50 per cent.Paccar, maker of the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands, and North America’s second-biggest truckmaker by sales, says it expects overall heavy truck sales in the US and Canada this year to total between 210,000 and 240,000 vehicles, compared with 225,000 in 2012. Robin Easton, Paccar’s treasurer, says that is around the level required to replace trucks at the end of their life.Several manufacturers are optimistic that the record average age of the North American truck fleet – about eight years – means many customers have no choice but to replace them with ones that consume less fuel and meet new, higher environmental standards.“In this economic environment, our customers are willing and capable of replacing their fleets,” Mr Easton says. “It’s just that at this particular time there are not that many that are willing to grow their fleet.”Navistar International, maker of International brand trucks, saw its share of the US heavy truck market fall from 18 per cent in the year to the end of October from 28 per cent in the same period of 2011, partly because of its initial failure to produce an engine that met the latest US environmental requirements.Mr Daum predicts that this replacement trend will lead to a growing divide between small operators – who run many of the trucks in Red Hook – and larger, better-financed ones.Daimler’s latest trucks, Mr Daum points out, consumed 14 per cent less fuel than their equivalents as recently as 2009.Many small operators, their margins squeezed because they use older, less fuel-efficient trucks, struggle to raise the finance to buy newer vehicles.That gives large, well-financed operators like Old Dominion or YRC that run modern fleets “a huge operational cost advantage”, Mr Daum says. The advantage affects businesses’ most basic running costs.“I’m not talking [just] maintenance and reliability costs,” Mr Daum says of the advantages. “I mean hard cash fuel running through that engine.”
5;ETN;Eaton Corp;2013-02-05T17:46:47Z;Eaton profits dented on weak auto demand;;Eaton Corporation, the diversified industrial group, blamed worldwide economic uncertainty for holding back 2012 sales growth as it announced full-year results heavily dented by weak truck and car demand.Eaton announced fourth-quarter net income down 51 per cent to $179m as a result of $176m in acquisition charges, mainly for last year’s purchase of Cooper Industries, and $50m in restructuring charges.Another diversified industrial group – Emerson – also sounded a cautious note when it announced net earnings for the September to December quarter up 22 per cent to $454m, on revenues up 5 per cent to $5.6bn. It said business investment remained “slow and cautious” globally, but that there were signs of thawing in some frozen markets.The market responded positively to Eaton’s announcement, particularly its projection that 2013 operating earnings per share, excluding $145m in projected charges for integrating acquisitions, would rise about 8 per cent to between $4.05 and $4.45 per share. Full-year earnings per diluted share fell 12 per cent to $3.46. The shares rose 2.81 per cent to $58.17.Sandy Cutler, chief executive, said the market was reacting to signs that the integration of Cooper was going “even better than expected”.Emerson’s shares meanwhile fell 1.4 per cent to $56.67.Eaton suffered from sharp falls in demand in some of its core markets. Fourth-quarter operating profits in its truck segment, which supplies truckmakers, fell 41 per cent to $81m, on sales down 26 per cent to $504m.North American truck production in the quarter was 23 per cent down on 2011, it said. In automotive business, exposure to the collapsing European auto industry led fourth-quarter operating profits down 60 per cent to $17m, on sales down 8 per cent to $367m.Mr Cutler said that Eaton’s vehicle businesses – once the group’s core – now accounted for only 40 per cent of turnover. The electrical businesses that now account for 60 per cent of turnover had held up far better. Electrical Americas reported fourth-quarter operating profits up 11 per cent to $193m, on sales up 3 per cent to $1.15bn.Electrical Rest of the World fourth-quarter operating profits rose 1 per cent to $70m, on sales up 2 per cent to $711m. Cooper Industries, which the company took over on November 30, provided $66m operating profits and $470m sales for December.Full-year net income fell 9.9 per cent to $1.22bn, on sales up from $16bn to $16.3bn.“The electrical segments are working really well,” Mr Cutler said. “We’ve seen weakness in the traditional vehicle and hydraulics markets. But the restructuring in what is now 60 per cent of the company – electrical – is really paying off.”
6;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-10-31T13:46:09Z;Eaton cuts forecast on weak economy;;Eaton, the industrial components maker, cut forecasts for growth in the markets it serves for the third successive quarter on Wednesday as it announced third-quarter net income 5 per cent down on last time.Economic growth in both Europe and China had remained subdued during the third quarter, said Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive. Economic activity in the US had decelerated as a result of concerns over the “fiscal cliff” of tax and spending changes possible in the new year, leading customers to hold back on purchases.“As a result, we expect our markets for full year 2012 will show less growth than we had anticipated earlier in the year, with our markets for the year now estimated to grow between 1-2 per cent,” Mr Cutler said.Eaton had forecast growth for its markets of 5 per cent at the end of the first quarter and 3-4 per cent at the end of the second quarter.Eaton is exposed to industrial segments that are highly sensitive to global demand for heavy industrial goods, including electrical and hydraulic control systems, aerospace and truckmaking.Net income fell to $345m from $365m in last year’s third quarter on revenue down 4 per cent to $3.95bn. Diluted earnings per share fell 5 per cent to $1.02.Operating profits at Electrical Americas, the biggest single segment, rose 33 per cent to $207m, on revenue up 6 per cent to $1.14bn. Both residential and non-residential electrical markets had posted particularly strong growth during the quarter, Mr Cutler said.Operating profits in electrical rest of the world rose 23 per cent to $76m on sales down 9 per cent to $686m. Six percentage points of the decline reflected currency effects, while another three points were a result of volume falls.Shareholders in Cooper Industries, the electrical systems control manufacturer that Eaton in May announced plans to buy for $11.8bn, approved the transaction on Friday. Eaton said that it now expected to incur some of the integration costs for Cooper in the fourth quarter, rather than in the first quarter next year, as originally envisaged.
7;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-10-10T18:28:41Z;Bain Capital buys Apex Tool for $1.6bn;;Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said it would acquire Apex Tool for about $1.6bn, the second big US hardware deal announced in two days.Apex Tool, a joint venture formed in 2010 by Danaher Corp and Cooper Industries, is a leading manufacturer of power tools, drill chunks and soldering products.Danaher and Cooper own equal shares of Apex Tool, which is based in Sparks, Maryland, and the sale to Bain will allow each company to shed a non-core asset. At the joint venture’s inception, the two companies combined their tools businesses into a consolidated operation.“With the support of Danaher and Cooper, we’ve succeeded in combining two premier tool manufacturers into a single world-class company,” said Steve Breitzka, Apex Tool chief executive, who will continue to lead the company, on Wednesday.A wave of disposals, led by industrials groups, has led to divestitures accounting for a record share of deal volume this year. Dealmakers expect the trend to continue, with more tool deals in particular.On Tuesday Stanley Black & Decker, a rival of Apex Tool, sold its hardware and home improvement unit to Spectrum Brands for $1.4bn in cash.The deal gives both Danaher and Cooper welcome room to focus on their core businesses.Danaher in February acquired Beckman Coulter, a diagnostic equipment maker, for $6.8bn, part of the group’s continued push into the healthcare and life sciences market. Cooper is in the process of combining with Eaton Corp, after their $11.8bn deal was announced in May, a move that will see the new group focus on industrial components instead of consumer goods.Bain, meanwhile, has been an active acquirer of divisions being disposed of by big groups. In 2010 it paid $1.6bn to Dow Chemical for the Styron basic plastics unit. And later that year the private equity group joined with Advent International to pay $2.7bn for Royal Bank of Scotland’s credit card processing group.“We’ve been impressed with the global platform of market leading positions that the Apex Tool team have been able to build. In the market, Apex Tool is known for its long tradition of quality and manufacturing excellence and portfolio of well-known tools brands,” said Seth Meisel, a managing director at Bain.Barclays and RBC Capital advised Bain, with Kirkland & Ellis providing legal counsel. Goldman Sachs advised Apex Tool.
8;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Eaton switches on to Chile energy;;"Chile has tens of billions of dollars of mining projects in the pipeline, but bringing them onstream requires a kind of unglamorous back office in the form of switches and engineering services to keep the power to them running.Enter Eaton Corp, a US diversified power management company, which has snapped up Santiago-based power assembly provider Rolec Comercial e Industrial for an undisclosed fee.“Latin America is one of the fastest-growing areas of our business,” João Everto Souza, Eaton’s marketing and business development manager for South America, told beyondbrics. Latin America accounted for $1.9bn of the group’s $16bn sales last year. He declined to be drawn on how that could grow with the Rolec addition.While Chile, the world’s biggest copper producing country, and northern neighbour Peru may still have diplomatic scores to settle, as far as businesses are concerned, Chile is the ideal launch pad for expansion into the Andean region.Eaton brackets Chile together with Peru from a business perspective: both have a string of attractive mining projects plus high economic growth and low inflation that make them attractive. Chile, thus, is a smart base.There are concerns in Chile that energy bottlenecks may delay or derail some mining projects, but Eaton is unruffled and sees the move into Chile as ideal to expand in the region, especially in the Andes. As Souza says:Eaton has growth through acquisitions in its DNA so we are always looking for good opportunities.That doesn’t apply to Argentina, mind you. Souza says “We are always looking for good opportunities but Argentina is going through a bad moment.”Related reading:

9;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-07-23T20:33:27Z;Eaton cuts outlook amid slow world growth;;Eaton said weakness in Europe and emerging markets would dampen earnings this year even as it beat Wall Street’s expectations with a 14 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit.The industrial equipment maker was the latest US manufacturer to warn that turmoil in the global economy may curb its growth this year.“The uncertainty in Europe, as well as slower economic growth rates in China, India and Brazil, resulted in weakness in a number of our end markets,” said Sandy Cutler, chief executive.“We now believe our end markets for the year are likely to grow by 3 to 4 per cent, a reduction from the 5 per cent growth we had forecast in April.”Eaton’s stock closed nearly 4 per cent higher on Monday in New York, however, as investors cheered its performance in the second quarter.In the three months to June 30, net income rose to $382m, or $1.12 a share, from $336m, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts of $1.07.Sales fell to $4.07bn from $4.09bn in the quarter, however, due to slowdowns in markets outside the US and lower-than-expected foreign exchange rates, Mr Cutler said.Eaton noted that emerging markets contributed 24 per cent of revenues in the quarter, a share that has fallen since last year.Performance in the US was strong, with revenues from the Americas electrical business, Eaton’s largest segment, rising 10 per cent to $1.13bn from $1.03bn. Mr Cutler cited the continuing improvement in commercial real estate as well as a nascent recovery in residential property.But sales in Eaton’s “rest of the world” electrical segment dropped 13 per cent to $683m. Mr Cutler said he expected full-year sales in the segment to fall 3 per cent, worse than the 1 per cent decline previously forecast.Eaton reduced its outlook for 2012 earnings to between $4.09 and $4.39 a share from an earlier estimate of between $4.23 and $4.63.Mr Cutler said the company expected 8 per cent growth in the US would be offset by a 1 per cent decline elsewhere in 2012.“US markets stay strong. Non-US markets, not much of a recovery expected this year,” he told analysts on Monday. “Our outlook constitutes a recalibration of global growth prospects. I don’t think there’s any surprise.”Eaton also expects foreign exchange to weigh on full-year sales, forecasting currency volatility will cut $500m from 2012 revenue, up from an earlier prediction of $300m.Mr Cutler said that even amid the company’s strength in the US, there were some signs that businesses were cutting back on investments as uncertainty mounted over the “fiscal cliff”- spending cuts and tax increases set to kick in at the end of the year.“We believe we’re seeing that in the truck market today,” he said. “If a business is thinking of investing, whether by hiring or investing in capital equipment, they will not do that if they think there’s a real uncertainty.”But he said Eaton also sees opportunities in a slow global growth environment. “The big mega-trend Eaton is helping customers with is how to use less energy,” he said. “Energy costs will continue to get more expensive.”He said Eaton’s acquisition of Cooper Industries, the electrical equipment maker, was a bid to expand its footprint in energy. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
11;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-05-21T21:26:32Z;Wall Street rallies as sell-off subsides;;Industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation said it would acquire the electrical equipment supplier Cooper Industries for $11.8bn, sending shares in Cooper up by more than 25 per cent on Monday.Meanwhile, US equities enjoyed their best single-day performance since mid-March as stocks shook off recent gloom to reclaim the 1,300-points level.In a statement, Eaton Corp and Cooper Industries said the transaction was expected to be completed in the second half of this year and that the merger would allow the new company – to be called Eaton – to expand its products and geographic reach.“This compelling combination of Eaton’s power distribution and power quality equipment and systems with Cooper’s diversified component brands, global reach and international distribution creates a game changer to serve the electrical industry,” Alexander Cutler, Eaton’s chairman and chief executive, said.The deal is expected to generate about $535m in annual synergies by 2016. The offer represents a 29 per cent premium for shares in Cooper from Friday’s close. Cooper shares jumped 25.1 per cent to $69.88. Shares in Eaton lost 0.7 per cent to $42.09.Shares in Facebook dropped as much as 13.7 per cent as the social networking site fell sharply below its initial offer price on its second day of trading as a public company.Facebook, which edged slightly higher on Friday after debuting at $38, finished 11 per cent lower to $34.03, bringing its market capitalisation below the $100bn mark.The company’s share price losses reverberated across the social networking and technology sector. In early activity, the online game maker Zynga declined more than 11 per cent and the business reviews website Yelp dropped as much as 13 per cent. But by midday, both companies were able to move into positive territory and outperformed Facebook, which maintained its losses from the morning session.Shares in Zynga finished the day 1 per cent lower at $7.09, while Yelp rose 3.5 per cent to $19.30.Nasdaq OMX, the parent company of Nasdaq Stock Market, gained 3.6 per cent to $22.78 as its chief executive said over the weekend that he was “embarrassed” by the delay in the opening trade of Facebook’s initial public offering on Friday.Elsewhere, China’s largest e-commerce company Alibaba said it would buy back half of the US internet group Yahoo’s 40 per cent stake in it for a minimum of $7.1bn. The deal paves the way for Yahoo to relinquish its holdings in Alibaba. Yahoo will receive $6.3bn in cash and up to $800m in newly issued Alibaba preferred stock. Yahoo gained 1 per cent to $15.58.Colin Gillis, technology analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Yahoo remains a turnround company, but investors who are interested in accelerating earnings driven by cost reductions and decreasing share count should consider investing.”He added: “While revenue growth is still likely to be challenging, we do expect the company to surprise to the upside on earnings in the near term while slowing increasing revenue growth throughout the year.”Overall, the S&P 500 moved strongly into positive territory and gained 1.6 per cent to 1,315,99. The benchmark US index fell below the 1,300 level last week for the first time since January and has been suffering from a downward trend that has wiped off more than 7 per cent of its gains for the year since the start of May.Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said some investors were fearful that the recent pullback had morphed into a “correction, bear market or mega-meltdown”.But he also said investors were worried about reducing their equity portfolio and missing out on an impending recovery.John Hussman, a fund manager, said: “On a very short horizon, the market appears significantly compressed and open to a standard fast, furious, prone-to-failure bout of short covering in order to clear that condition.”He added: “The problem here is that economic conditions are beginning to surprise significantly on the downside, and credit strains are rapidly increasing in Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 12,504.48. The earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar moved 3.7 per cent higher to $91.98. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.5 per cent to 2,847.21. Apple shares, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, rose 5.8 per cent to $561.28.Elsewhere, shares in BlackRock lost 2.4 to $167.73 after the UK bank Barclays said it would sell its entire 19.6 per cent stake in the US investment management company through an offering and share buyback. The value of the disposal of Barclay’s stake is about $6.1bn.Shares in JPMorgan Chase were 2.9 per cent lower at $32.51. The US bank has lost about $30bn in market capitalisation since it disclosed a $2bn trading loss two and a half weeks ago. On Monday JPMorgan said it would suspend its share buybacks that had been planned after the bank successfully passed the Federal Reserve’s “stress tests” in March.
12;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-05-21T14:29:04Z;Eaton buys Cooper Industries for $11.8bn;;Eaton Corp, the US industrial components manufacturer, is making a bet on the global power industry with the $12.6bn agreed acquisition of Cooper Industries, one of the US’ largest manufacturers of electrical equipment.Eaton is also relocating its incorporation from Ohio to Ireland where Cooper is registered, to save an expected $160m per year in tax and cash management costs.The takeover is the third-largest announced worldwide this year, at a time when dealmaking has been slowed by market turmoil triggered by the eurozone debt crisis.The deal gives Cooper an enterprise value of about $12.6bn and values the equity at about $11.8bn.The merged company will be known as Eaton “or a variant thereof”, and led by Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive.Mr Cutler said the deal would be “a game changer for the electrical industry”, because of the range of products that Eaton would be able to offer.By adding Cooper’s power distribution equipment and lighting to its product range, it will be able to supply customers running factories, oil rigs and other complex facilities with a wider range of systems and devices.It hopes to benefit from rising investment in the electrical industry, which will provide about 59 per cent of revenues, driven by the need for greater energy efficiency and the replacement of ageing infrastructure. The deal will increase Eaton’s revenues by a third. About half the merged company’s sales will be in the US, and about one quarter in emerging economies.The companies said the deal would generate about $535m in annual synergies by 2016, including $115m of increased profits on sales and $260m of lower operating costs.The offer is $39.15 in cash and 0.775 Eaton shares for each Cooper share. Based on Monday’s share price, the offer was worth about $72.30 per Cooper share, a 29 per cent premium to the closing price on Friday. Following the announcement, Eaton’s shares were up 0.1 per cent at $42.43, while Cooper’s were up 25.6 per cent at $70.11.Cooper, which was rumoured as a potential takeover target for Schneider Electric of France last year, has committed not to enter talks with any other possible bidder, and both sides have agreed a break-up fee should the deal not go through.Additional reporting by David Gelles and Anousha Sakoui
13;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-01-29T21:45:48Z;Western industrials feel a Chinese burn;;Western industrial companies have seen a slowdown in some markets in China as efforts to cool the world’s second largest economy have hit demand for capital goods and products linked to the construction industry.China was until recently a source of rapid growth for US and European manufacturers, helping to offset weak sales in developed countries.Last week, however, leading bellwether industrial groups including Siemens, 3M and Eaton were among those expressing caution on Chinese sales, joining others such as Volvo and ABB that warned of cooling demand at the end of last year.Joe Kaeser, chief financial officer at Siemens, which reported a 16 per cent decline in new Chinese orders in its fiscal first quarter, said the company had witnessed a “marked slowdown in short cycle businesses” in China, particularly in industrial automation.George Buckley, chief executive at 3M, the US industrial group said: “Our China team anticipate continued below-trend growth in the first half of 2012.”Weakness in Chinese orders comes at an unwelcome time for industrial companies, which are already having to deal with a European economy on the brink of recession. “Coming on the back of the weak European picture, the situation in China is not going to be a help to first-quarter earnings,” said Ben Uglow at Morgan Stanley.Not all western companies selling in China have suffered from a slowdown in demand. Honeywell, which makes aircraft parts and controls, said on Friday its sales in China were up 18 per cent in 2011.Dave Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer, said sales growth for products linked to the residential and commercial property markets, such as heating and air-conditioning equipment, had slowed, but other markets such as aircraft and truck components were “doing very well”.Consumer-orientated businesss are also still enjoying a boost from robust retail demand, as booming Chinese sales of Apple’s iPhone attest.China’s property slowdown has been a result of government policy intended to rein in house prices and curb inflation.Other companies affected have been those selling short-cycle products: items that are ordered, paid for and delivered in a relatively short time, such as industrial automation equipment.Overcapacity in China’s steel, wind or shipbuilding industries as well as slowing infrastructure spending are also eroding industrial volumes and margins.Many western companies are looking ahead to a return to more rapid growth in Chinese markets this year.DuPont, the chemicals group, said last week that sales volumes in the Asia-Pacific region were down 23 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the same period a year earlier. However, Ellen Kullman, DuPont’s chief executive, said a reduction from 9 per cent to 8 per cent growth in China was “still pretty good if you look around the world”.After heavy destocking in the fourth quarter, “we’re starting with very little inventory …And I think that bodes well for an improving picture”, she added.Signs in the US of a continued recovery in demand for capital goods also suggest many companies may be able to offset sluggish markets in China.Most economists expect China to pick up in the second half of the year as the government eases its tightening measures to support the economy. Bernd Laux, at Cheuvreux, said: “It’s not currently a huge headache for corporate management. But should the US recovery come to a halt and the Chinese market not recover during the second half, then it may become a more significant problem.”Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing and Michael Stothard in Stockholm
14;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-01-26T18:48:32Z;Industrial groups see strong US growth;;North American industrial companies are predicting that the US will be one of their big growth markets in 2012 for the first time since the start of the financial crisis, reflecting rising demand for everything from excavators to truck parts.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment, brushed off concerns about a possible slowdown in the global economy and said it expected real US construction spending to increase this year for the first time since 2004.The upturn in demand in the US was helping the manufacturer to experience its “best growth since Harry Truman was president”, said Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations.The International Monetary Fund warned this week that global economic growth was slowing and might slow further if European leaders did not take decisive action to tackle their sovereign debt crisis.While Caterpillar echoed concerns that policymakers could derail the recovery by prematurely tightening economic policies, the company said it expected the US economy to pick up steam this year and added that “the risk of a worldwide recession has diminished significantly”.The vote of confidence in the US was underscored by Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment and components for trucks and aircraft, which said it expected its markets to grow faster in the US than in the rest of the world for the first time since the mid-2000s.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said he expected economic growth would still be faster in emerging economies such as China and India than in the US. But Eaton’s sales had been hit by the slowdown in Chinese construction, he said, while US markets were picking up.“Most people would say their view of the US economy is a little better than it was three months ago,” he said. “Consumers are spending money, non-residential construction is starting to rise, the car market is picking up and exports and manufacturing capacity utilisation are up, creating demand for trucks and factory automation equipment.”Even the US residential housing market, which had had “its worst year since World War Two” in 2011 was now starting to turn up a little, Mr Cutler said.After trailing for the first ten months of last year, a late surge in housing construction meant that work began on 606,900 houses in the US last year, up from 586,900 in 2010. Caterpillar predicts there will be 700,000 housing starts this year.Official figures also suggested a robust outlook for US capital spending. New orders for durable goods orders rose 3 per cent in December, following an upwardly revised 4.3 per cent increase in November, according to the commerce department, beating analysts’ average forecast of a 2 per cent increase.Caterpillar said it would increase its capital expenditure this year to $4bn from $3bn in 2011 to take advantage of what it believes is a multiyear economic up-cycle.The company said it expects revenues of $68bn-$72bn this year and profits of about $9.25 per share, ahead of the $9.07 analysts expected. It issued its outlook as it reported profits for the fourth quarter of last year that far exceeded Wall Street forecasts. Caterpillar earned $1.5bn in the fourth quarter, up from $968m in the same period a year earlier.Stripping out the impact of its November 2010 acquisition of Bucyrus International, the mining-equipment maker, Caterpillar earned a net profit of $2.25 per share, well ahead of the $1.69 analysts had been expecting on average.The figures completed a year in which Caterpillar notched up record revenues, profits, exports and order backlog.However, industrial companies’ expectations for the US market have not been universally strong. Emerson Electric, the industrial equipment manufacturer, said on Wednesday that in the three months to December, its orders were hit by “delayed infrastructure investment by US telecommunications service providers” and a “challenging” market for air conditioners in North America.Caterpillar shares were trading up 2.5 per cent at $111.17 by early afternoon in New York. Eaton was down 3.2 per cent at $47.98, while Emerson was down 0.3 per cent at $51.93.
15;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-01-24T14:39:58Z;CRM: Managing business clients can be a complex matter;Stephen Pritchard notices convergence with business-to-consumer systems;The best-known examples of customer relationship management technology come from businesses that sell services to consumers in large volumes.But while the priority for a company such as Amazon, the online retailer, or BT, the UK telecoms company, is to automate as many dealings with customers as possible, the situation is rather different for companies that sell to other businesses.“We will do many, many transactions with the same customer, and that customer will have organisations spread all over the world,” says Justin Kershaw, chief information officer for the industrial sector at Eaton Corporation, an Ohio company that makes components for markets that include aerospace, automotive, and power generation.“In the consumer model, the consumer is usually in one location.“We’re handling a single relationship with customers spread all over the world. That brings complexities when it comes to providing service agreements and handling issues [and] is quite different to a consumer model.”As a manufacturer of industrial products, Eaton has direct sales staff for large customers, and an account management and distributor-based sales channel for smaller markets. Tying that together relies increasingly on technology.“We keep a vast array of information about our customers and our markets, and technology is used to analyse that and help us manage it,” says Mr Kershaw.“We use technology to interact with the customer and to capture the transactions we are processing.”Businesses selling to other businesses are turning more to IT, to provide both better levels of customer service and to help form a more accurate picture of their relationships.For companies operating internationally, and in multiple markets, CRM technology is also helping to provide a single view of the customer, in much the same way banks and retailers are attempting to do for consumers.“Companies want to deploy CRM systems for two reasons: to automate as much as possible of the business process and to improve the ‘visibility’ of the way the business interacts with its customers,” says Anthony Lye, senior vice-president for CRM at Oracle, the technology company.When it comes to complex business-to-business relationships, he says, this is not just about identifying transactions, but helping sales staff to spot accounts their colleagues are involved with.It is also about simplifying workflows, and bringing together data from an ever-larger number of sources.Increasingly that also includes information from external sources, such as social media.Consumer brands might be concerned about reputation on Twitter or Facebook, but business-to-business vendors are increasingly sensitive to discussions about their products in forums such as user groups.“One technology change we are seeing is a greater use of moderated user groups, and the encouragement of peer to peer support,” says Charlie Simpson, an expert in customer management systems at PA Consulting. “[Businesses] are using social media to get customer feedback more quickly.”There is a trend for business-to-consumer and business-to-business CRM to converge and this is driven in part by easier-to-use technology, and in part by a growing emphasis on customers in industrial and other businesses.“The idea that B2B and B2C requirements differ is stuck in the ’90s,” says Alex Dayon, executive vice-president for applications at Salesforce.com, a software company.“It is true that B2B and B2C are developing at a different pace. But there are different complexities to the relationships and differences in the number of people involved.”Business-to-consumer relationships tend to involve large volumes of lower-value, simple transactions.When businesses sell to other businesses they might be selling highly complex products or services – one transaction worth a million dollars, rather than a million one-dollar transactions.But this masks the wide variety of relationships companies have with their business customers. Some deals are complex, and best described as partnerships.“There is a lot of information you might share with a business partner, and complexity around what knowledge to share, or not. You may have to expose some of your systems for the process to run end to end,” says Duncan Barnes, from the CRM team at Deloitte, the consultancy.Others are simple, repeatable interactions that are much closer to those that businesses might have with consumers, and that may lend themselves to automation.They may include customer self service, an idea borrowed from systems developed for mass-market consumer brands.At Eaton Corporation, Mr Kershaw describes this as “leaning out” the customer relationship. “It is not primarily for ourselves but for the benefit of the customer,” he says.“There is a vast amount of information that is required to make purchasing agreements or decisions to buy. If we can take cycles out of that, and have more questions answered or more issues resolved in one touch of the customer, or two, that is the most effective way.”
16;ETN;Eaton Corp;2012-01-08T19:04:26Z;US industrials saddle up for bumpy 2012;;Confronted by an unsettled global outlook for 2012, leading US industrial companies are turning inward to boost performance, cutting costs and restructuring their businesses in an attempt to raise earnings on what could be a bumpy journey.In the past month or so, a dozen leading US industrial groups have provided guardedly optimistic forecasts for next year, arguing that a mix of exposure to faster growing markets, acquisitions and productivity improvements will help them to power through any slowdown.Manufacturing companies will need to work hard to stay ahead of a volatile global economy. Weak spots include Europe, which may already be in recession, and potentially China, where the government is faced with a real estate bubble.In a sign of what to expect, Alcoa, which on Monday opens the US reporting season, last week unveiled aggressive moves to cut costs affecting 12 per cent of its aluminium smelting capacity.On average, US industrial companies are expecting lower revenue growth in 2012 than last year but higher earnings growth through increased volumes.For the fourth quarter of last year, analysts on average expect the industrial sector to report earnings 7.2 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2010, roughly in line with growth for the market as a whole, according to S&P Capital IQ. Analysts expect that pace to accelerate this year, but the economic outlook suggests that pickup is far from certain.Even in the US, where recent data have pointed to unexpected economic strength, there are reasons for caution. Richard Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment, noted recently that economists were unusually divided on the outlook.Given the political deadlock in Washington, “it’s hard to figure out exactly where we end up”, he told investors late last year. “That is a note of caution that I think most large companies have about 2012. And I think we are all planning in a pretty conservative way.”Global uncertainty is already taking its toll. Last month, Emerson Electric, a widely respected conglomerate, convened a hasty conference call to warn that its revenues in the first quarter of 2012 would be down 3-5 per cent compared to the same period a year earlier, though maintaining its full year guidance.“It’s clearly extraordinary times out there, a lot of moving parts,” David Farr, chief executive of Emerson, told investors.Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners said the move was partly due to company-specific problems and the impact of the recent floods in Thailand but noted that it triggered alarm bells nonetheless.“What we fear most is that all the companies who have provided guidance in the last [few] weeks have to substantially backpedal due to much worse macro conditions than they anticipated,” he said, though adding that for the moment industrials were maintaining capital expenditures.Some industrial companies have already decided to cut costs further to prepare for this uncertain future. Emerson, Danaher and a number of others have said they will modestly increase spending on restructuring in 2012 while others such as Honeywell expect to benefit from action in late 2011.Alcoa is planning to shut down temporarily 5 per cent of its smelting capacity, and close permanently a further 7 per cent that had been in temporary shutdown. Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, described the moves as “difficult but necessary steps to improve Alcoa’s competitiveness, preserve and grow shareholder value and protect jobs.”Lawrence Culp, chief executive of Danaher, the acquisitive conglomerate, says the company is already running a modified version of its 2008 playbook, targeting market share, cutting costs and using cash to make deals. “We’re just trying to be nimble …not be draconian and preparing for the apocalypse,” he told investors in December.Some analysts worry about a lack of urgency. In a note to investors in mid-December, Barclays Capital said many industrial groups seemed to have run out of ideas and warned that investors were losing faith.However, if it looks as though margins – already at record highs in the industrial sector – are coming under pressure, companies say they will take more radical action. “We’ll try to read and react to what happens [in] the next couple of weeks,” says Mr Culp, “[to see] if we need to take a more conservative posture”.Another tactic for securing earnings growth in turbulent markets will be through acquisitions. Danaher expects to have about $5bn available to make deals in the next two years, and Morgan Stanley estimates that conglomerates will have about $90bn for deals and share repurchases through 2014.“Industrial companies will remain active in looking at larger deals, but are focused on transactions that generate significant synergies, rather than on further diversification,” said Larry Hamdan, head of global industrials M&A at Barclays Capital.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
17;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Skills gap hobbles US employers;;Drew Greenblatt has been looking for more than a year for three sheet-metal set-up operators to work day, night or weekend shifts.The president of Marlin Steel Wire Products, a company in Baltimore with 30 employees, Mr Greenblatt says his inability to find qualified workers is hampering his business’s growth. “If I could fill those positions, I could raise our annual revenues from $5m to $7m,” he says.He is offering a salary of more than $80,000 with overtime, including health and pension benefits. Yet in spite of extensive advertising, he has had no qualified applicants. He is trying to train some of his unskilled staff but says none has the ability or drive to complete the training.Mr Greenblatt’s predicament speaks to one of the biggest economic debates about today’s 8.6 per cent US unemployment rate: is it merely a cyclical problem that will shrink as demand recovers? Or is it something deeper and more structural, a “mismatch” between the skills workers have and those companies need?The idea there is something structurally wrong with the US workforce is controversial among economists but has a certain resonance with the public. Since the emergence of Japan as a technology and manufacturing powerhouse in the 1970s, Americans have been anxiousthat they were losing their competitive edge to better-educated, harder-working rivals.Economists trying to figure out whether unemployment is cyclical or structural have turned to what they call the Beveridge curve: the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.Vacancies, the number of unfilled positions, have risen by 35 per cent since their trough in June 2009 – but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. If there are jobs but people are not filling them, it may be because their skills are not up to scratch, say those who fear structural unemployment.But a preponderance of economists argue this is a misreading of the data. A recent San Francisco Fed paper finds that vacancies are high relative to hiring across a broad range of industries, including those such as construction, where recent job cuts mean that there is most unlikely to be a skills shortage.The authors suggest companies may not be trying very hard to fill jobs, while workers in receipt of unemployment insurance may not be trying that hard to find them.Policy moves by the US Federal Reserve reflect a view that most unemployment is not the result of a skills mismatch. But even those who believe that today’s unemployment problem is primarily cyclical say closing the “skills gap” noted by Mr Greenblatt will be essential if Americans are to enjoy stable work and rising wages.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told an audience in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August that the US had to “foster the development of a skilled workforce” if it was to enjoy good longer-term prospects. The US education system “despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population,” he said.US companies that are growing say an unqualified workforce is already a significant barrier to hiring.In a September poll of owners of fast-growing, privately held US companies undertaken by the non-profit Kauffman Foundation, the inability to find qualified workers was cited as the biggest obstacle to growth. Some 40 per cent of respondents said they were being held back by the skills gap, compared with just 13 per cent by lack of demand.Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron, is finding it tough to fill the 160 job openings it has available for roles such as maintenance and machine technicians.The company’s revenues grew by 35 per cent last year and are on course for 25 per cent growth this year. But Jeff Owens, chief executive, says it could expand faster if it could find qualified workers more quickly. “In other businesses the capacity constraint is buildings, plant or equipment,” he says. “In our business, a service business, it’s people.”US manufacturers have 600,000 unfilled positions because of a lack of qualified skilled workers, according to a report released in October by Deloitte, the consultants, and the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry body.Jill Bellak, chief operating officer of MBX, a company in suburban Chicago that makes computer hardware, says the fast-growing business is finding it tough to find good software engineers, production workers and salespeople to add to its 78-strong workforce.“You hear how high unemployment is and you think it would be easy to hire, but companies have tended to cut their lower performers and retain their best people,” says Ms Bellak. “Meanwhile, talented people are less inclined to leave their current positions than they would be in good times.”In manufacturing, the skills problem dates at least to the 1970s and 1980s, when companies began automating factories and outsourcing production. As a result, manufacturers found they did not have jobs for the people leaving their in-house training programmes, some of which were then scrapped.Some big manufacturers still train in-house, including Boeing, the aerospace manufacturer, which spends $80m a year on training its existing workforce. But not all do. “Technology moves fast and most companies don’t have the money or resources to pay for extensive retraining,” said Sir James Dyson, the British household appliances engineer.Without in-house training programmes, companies have often been left looking for staff with specific skills. “A generation ago, employers would hire and train employees. Now, they demand trained workers,” says Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.“The skills gap is largely a figment of companies’ imagination,” says Mr Cappelli. “They cannot find workers to do the very specific tasks they want done. That is different from not being able to find capable workers.”Companies counter that today’s jobs require a broad set of skills, and that the US educational system is not producing workers with the flexibility they need.“We have a training programme, but if someone applies for a job and doesn’t have basic math, I don’t have the wherewithal to teach them basic math,” says Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment.American 15-year-olds ranked 25th among the 34 developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in maths, 17th in science and 14th in reading ability, according to a 2009 OECD study.Many companies are realising they need to take the initiative in collaborating with educational institutions. Martin Swarbrick, chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, a Chicago manufacturer with 250 staff that makes industrial motors, says his company has had such a programme in place for years and it has helped him offset the skills gap.“We’ve done a lot of promoting from within,” he says. “A lot of our people started on the shop floor and now they’re completing their Masters degrees.”
18;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;3M: a Post-it note to the wise;The reason to own shares is that the company keeps on a very steady path;If it is thin, sticky, abrasive, reflective or absorptive, and it is used in a factory or an office, there is a reasonable chance that 3M makes it (along with assorted items that fit none of these descriptions). But highly diversified companies can deliver surprises, too, and sometimes nasty ones. On Tuesday, third-quarter results from the US industrial conglomerate were a bit light relative to estimates. More important, the company brought down its target for full-year organic sales volume growth (from 6-7.5 per cent to 3-4 per cent) and shaved a bit off earnings per share targets as well. Shareholders were less than pleased, sending the shares down more than 6 per cent.The softening outlook is made more difficult by the fact that recent reports from other broad-based industrial groups, such as Parker Hannifin and Eaton, do not share 3M’s gloom (though it is hard to make comparisons among companies that, for all their diversity, serve different end-markets). Still, the surprise and consternation implied by the price change seems a bit overdone. A look at the history shows that the company, in good years such as 2006 or 2007, grows volumes in the mid-to-high single-digit range. And if the global economy slows, growth quickly follows: volumes were off 2 per cent in 2008 and 10 per cent in 2009.The reason to keep owning 3M’s shares, however, is that management keeps the company on a very steady path financially, even as demand fluctuates from year to year. 3M spends steadily on research and development and spits out a steady stream of cash – since 2008 it has spent $10bn on dividends and buy-backs. Even during the horrible 2009, margins held and free cash flow did not fall alongside sales. This matters more than the top line. Post-it to self: 3M can be a low single-digit grower and that’s OK.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
19;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-09-08T15:42:22Z;US manufacturers feel weight of baby boomers;;The US’s biggest industrial companies face an average bill of at least $100m each over the next five years as they struggle to fill the skills gaps left by the looming retirement of “baby boomer” factory workers, according to a survey of manufacturers to be released today.The survey by The Nielsen Company of 100 top executives at US manufacturing companies underlines the scale of the demographic problem facing the US economy. In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.
20;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-08-03T20:52:01Z;Industrial groups fear wheel of fortune’s turn;;A glance at the second-quarter results of some of the world’s leading industrial companies gives little cause to doubt that the market for industrial goods is still in rude health.Producers of machinery, plant automation equipment and assorted other capital goods generally met sales expectations, as the strong emerging market demand that has powered the recovery held firm.But beneath the headline figures, pressures are building. Executives warn that the second half of the year will be much tougher as order growth slows, and currency and raw material price volatility squeeze profits.“Incoming orders remain very good but the indications of a slowdown are certainly here,” says Neville Warnes, managing director of Hadleigh Castings, a UK metals company.Ben Uglow at Morgan Stanley says: “As industrial companies have reported for the second quarter, the misses have not come in the top line but rather at the margin level.”Industrial companies are concerned about US debt and eurozone woes, a possible slowdown in China and the risk of overheating in other emerging markets“[US industrials] still feel reasonably optimistic about the back half [of the year] but you can tell that caution has crept in and rightly so with the macro data and the political uncertainty and everything else that is going on,” says Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners, a research firm.Recent data suggest manufacturers are experiencing stronger headwinds, although an outright economic reversal is not yet in evidence.The Institute for Supply Management reported this week that the US manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest pace in two years in July.Growth in German plant and machinery orders, adjusted for inflation, slowed in June to just 1 per cent from last year as domestic orders dropped by 14 per cent, said VDMA, the German engineering federation. “The decline of domestic orders can be explained by the exceptionally strong gain in the previous year but there are also first signs that the investment goods cycle in Germany and the euro-area member countries has become less dynamic,” says Olaf Wortman, VDMA economist.Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s global manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell last month to its lowest point since the start of the global recovery, a level it described as “consistent with a stall in economic activity within the industrial sector”.Mr Uglow says not all manufacturers are gloomy. “We are getting very mixed responses from industrial companies,” he says. “Some of them are openly saying there’s been change and some are still a bit in denial. [An industrial slowdown] is not yet the consensus view but I expect it will be in a few months. It’s certainly not yet consensus that demand has gone off a cliff.”Sir Kevin Smith, chief executive of GKN, which supplies manufacturers including Airbus, Boeing, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, says short-term concerns over the state of European and US economies are clouding a more positive longer term outlook for many developed-country global industrial suppliers.“There is poor sentiment – in the UK we are fascinated by the problems in the eurozone and concerns over our own lack of growth [in the UK]. There’s also the deficit issue in the US. Sentiment [towards industrials] is poor, but what’s happening out there is that some economies are performing strongly, even if with a little less momentum.”Performance has also varied by market. “Where anyone has any consumer exposure, [demand] has continued to be weak,” says Mr Sprague. “Conversely we saw good momentum in the automation markets, the aerospace markets and spending on the utility grid.”3m, the US conglomerate, missed Wall Street’s organic revenue growth expectations in the second quarter, due in part to a sharp decline in sales of its coatings for LCD televisions, although the company maintained its full-year guidance.Mr Sprague argues that spending on capital goods remains strong as companies make equipment upgrades and purchase new trucks, activities they postponed during the downturn.Those trends boosted Eaton Corp, which makes hydraulics and power-management equipment. During the second quarter, sales jumped 21 per cent to $4.1bn while profits surged 47 per cent to $338m.“Companies involved in important mega-trends [can] achieve really strong results at a period of time when …unemployment is high and the US economy is weak,” says Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton. “If you are in the right spots, you can do well.”At the same time multinational corporations have kept costs down by adding labour only sparingly, allowing them to profit from even modest increases in production volumes.Continued strong demand in emerging markets has helped to keep General Electric growing, says Keith Sherin, chief financial officer. Orders for infrastructure products such as aircraft engines rose 24 per cent in the second quarter.“Those orders are coming from resource-rich regions and from rising Asia,” he said. “International [industrial] revenues rose 23 per cent. In the US our revenue fell 2 per cent.”As a result, “we could have another year or more of decent industrial demand without much consumer help”, says Mr Sprague. “That buys you some time but ultimately, trucks need to haul something to take to consumers.”Additional reporting by Michael Kavanagh in London
21;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-07-25T21:10:16Z;Debt ceiling impasse pushes US stocks lower;;Wall Street weakened on Monday amid uncertainty over whether an agreement to raise the US federal debt ceiling would be reached, bringing nearer the possibility of a default by the US Treasury.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,337.43, ending a choppy session that hung on the pronouncements of US lawmakers. Nine of the S&P’s 10 major sectors declined, the softest being telecoms services, down 1.4 per cent, and healthcare, down 1.1 per cent. Utilities, a defensive sector, rose 0.3 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,842.80, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,592.80.Investors are waiting to see whether Congress can dissolve partisan deadlock and raise the $14,300bn debt ceiling and avoid potential default before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.Republicans and Democrats announced rival plans to increase the US borrowing cap.John Boehner, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, proposed raising the ceiling in two steps.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, announced a separate measure to raise the debt limit by $2,400bn in a single move.Anthony Conroy, managing director at Convergex, said: “When Congress fails to agree, it’s certainly not viewed as positive. Any uncertainty is creating volatility, and we’re witnessing that volatility today.”The Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, rose 11 per cent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “It still appears very unlikely that the US will actually default, since the political cost of being seen as the group which triggered one could be very high,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.“If there is a deal, even if it limits the growth in Treasury issuance over the next few years, it could remove the roadblock of budget uncertainty from both the economy and markets, an eventuality that should prove stock-positive and bond negative,” he added.The second-quarter earnings season was being overshadowed by the debt ceiling impasse.“We don’t have much in terms of economic news, so the focus is on what is not happening with getting the debt ceiling lifted,” said Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think there’s still juice in this market if they get a deal done.”Lorillard, the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands, fell 4.5 per cent to $107.29 despite reporting quarterly net profit that beat expectations. Analysts speculated that the shares were hit by investors taking profits since the stock had gained 37 per cent this year.Shares in Kimberly-Clarkfell 2.1 per cent to $66.48 after earnings dropped 1.8 per cent as higher costs weighed on the manufacturer of Kleenex tissues. The company also warned that its 2011 earnings could arrive near the lower end of its forecast.Eaton, a US manufacturer, gained 2.8 per cent to $52.59 after beating profit estimates, citing fresh demand for electrical systems and a strengthening truck market.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, reported second-quarter profits that beat forecasts.“The structural improvement in the underlying operations at [Baker Hughes] is no longer a secret to investors, but we expect that [second-quarter] results should help solidify recent improvement in investor sentiment towards the name,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The stock rose 0.1 per cent to $79.94.A handful of downstream oil companies were also strong. Marathon Petroleum rose 2 per cent to $41.37 after investment bank Dahlman Rose rated the stock a buy. Tesoro, an independent oil refiner concentrated on the US west coast, rose 3.2 per cent to $25.16.Research in Motion announced it was cutting 2,000 jobs. The stock fell 4.4 per cent to $26.67.Shares in TD Ameritrade rose 1.8 per cent to $19.96, while E*Trade rose 5.6 per cent to $16.52, on talk TD was in discussions to acquire the online brokerage.HCA, the largest US hospital operator which listed its shares in March, sank 19.2 per cent to $27.97 after its facilities saw a decline in complex surgeries and patient volumes disappointed analysts.
22;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-07-18T18:41:29Z;Suppliers braced for aircraft orders boom;;At the recent Paris Air Show aircraft manufacturers added hundreds more orders to their swollen backlogs, but the supply chain is already showing signs of stress, prompting leading executives to worry whether they will be able to meet surging demand.Already Boeing and Airbus are dramatically increasing the production rates of their existing single-aisle aircraft even as they bring online capacity to build new models and new competitors enter the fray.Over the next five years analysts at Forecast International expect production of commercial and military aircraft to jump more than 50 per cent to 4,870 units in 2016, as the global economy recovers and travellers return to the skies.For individual suppliers to specific programmes the jump in production is likely to be even more dramatic. Analysts with RBC Capital Markets expect Boeing to deliver six 787 aircraft this year but 33 aircraft next year and 108 in 2015.“We are ramping up all our programmes and so is the competition and the new entrants,” Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, told the Financial Times. “We watch this carefully … because one bad supplier can stop the entire production line.”For Boeing the stakes are particularly high. In 1997, the company tried to double production of its 737 family in 18 months and failed. Parts and material shortages forced Boeing to shut down production for a month and take more than $1.5bn in charges.“There are a lot of scars in the Boeing company,” Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, admitted recently. “We got in trouble because we hadn’t verified that the supply chain was ready.”This time round, Mr Albaugh says the company is doing just that, spending time talking with suppliers to make sure that they have “the people, the processes, the tools” they need – what one executive describes as “homework checking”.For now the preparation seems to be paying off. Craig Arnold, vice-chairman of Eaton, which makes hoses, couplings and other parts for aircraft such as the 787, says that his company is well able to handle a 15 per cent annual increase in production within its existing footprint.Mr Arnold argues that there is sufficient spacing between major programmes to allow the supply chain to respond to the production increases. “Too many of them are late quite frankly but the pacing is different,” he says.Indeed, long cycles and production delays have given companies such as Allegheny Technologies, which makes metals for the aerospace industry, plenty of time to expand its capacity.After heavy investments over the past few years, by the end of 2011 the company will be able to churn out about 47 per cent more titanium products compared to the prior peak in 2007 and 13 per cent more nickel alloys, says Dan Greenfield, head of investor relations.Productivity improvements and innovations in material science should give the company even more flexibility, Mr Greenfield says, because new alloys and pressing techniques lead to less waste.Erik Paulhardt, vice-president of aerospace and defence for The Timken Company, which makes bearings and other components, has also expanded capacity.But he argues that improved communication between customers and suppliers will be even more crucial in preventing shortages, by reducing the uncertainty that leads some companies to over-order.“Historically, we haven’t done a good job of working collaboratively, but if you eliminate the noise [from double ordering, and so on] then there should be enough capacity to meet demand.”Elsewhere in the supply chain early signs of stress are showing. Lead time for delivering components made from titanium and nickel alloys, crucial for jet engines, have more than doubled over the past year or so because of heavy demand for raw materials.“It’s a Catch-22,” Mark Donegan, chief executive of Precision Castparts, a key supplier of forged components, told investors at the end of May. “On one hand we’re getting shorter cycles from our customers and [on the other hand] the lead times are going out.”While PCP has the bricks and mortars in place, Mr Donegan warns that getting hold of the right people is more difficult. “As strange as it is and as much as you see the unemployment rates, there’s not people standing at the door … So what we’ve been really trying to reinforce to our customers is you’ve got to give us some time to step up.”Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets says that despite the efforts to work together, suppliers and their customers are often at odds over when to hire or build up stocks. “No one wants to be the one left holding the inventory hot potato. You are always trying to keep it with someone else.”As production rates exceed previous peaks, Mr Stallard expects manufacturers to find things tougher. “The industry will cross the line in the next 12 months and then it goes into uncharted territory pretty soon after that.”And in spite of all of the preparation, Mr Arnold notes that typically it is “what you don’t know that bites you. The stuff that we can think through, we are putting plans in place. If you get in trouble it is likely to be something that you didn’t anticipate.”Additional reporting by Mark Odell
23;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-04-27T19:08:26Z;Materials costs squeeze US industry;;Rising prices for commodities such as oil and steel and inflation in emerging economies are a threat to the revival of US manufacturing industry, executives at some of the leading companies have warned.Manufacturers such as United Technologies, Honeywell, Eaton, Ford Motor and Boeing have been reporting stronger-than-expected earnings for the first quarter and often raising their forecasts of growth for the full year.The industrial sector has been the second strongest in the S&P 500 this year, outperformed only by energy.While manufacturers’ confidence in the global outlook has been growing, concerns about rising commodity prices, inflation in emerging economies, and the policy responses to those price rises have become increasingly pressing. This year, oil has risen by 22 per cent for benchmark Brent crude, while steel is up 17 per cent, driven by continuing strong demand in emerging economies and the recovery in the developed world.United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis lifts, said it had been surprised by the strength of demand right across the business.But Greg Hayes, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “Commodity inflation is the one thing that really concerns us this year.”The threat is not so much the squeeze on margins created by higher costs, although that is having an effect. Ford warned that earnings for the rest of the year might not be as strong as in its bumper first quarter, in part because of rising raw materials costs.However, the large global manufacturers generally seem able to pass on their higher costs to their customers, albeit with a lag. Eaton, which makes industrial equipment and components, reported strong earnings growth that would have been even stronger but for a delay in raising its prices, but said that was only a temporary problem.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, pointed out that during 2003-07, when prices for energy and other commodities were rising steadily, the company had still been able to expand its margins.3M, the diversified manufacturer, also suffered a squeeze on margins from raw materials prices in the first quarter, but David Meline, its chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call that “for the full year 2011, selling price increases are expected to offset raw material inflation”.The real threat for these companies is that the commodity price effect might hit demand, perhaps as a result of tighter monetary or fiscal policy intended to fight inflation.David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell, which makes parts for aircraft and vehicles as well as industrial equipment, said: “The industrial economy is doing very well, despite the challenging headlines.”But he added that the greatest risk he saw was “if we have significantly greater commodity inflation and an oil price shock to the economy, and geopolitical instability, which could be interrelated.”There are winners as well as losers from higher oil prices. General Electric has been rapidly building up its business serving the oil and gas industry, buying Wellstream for $1.3bn and the well support division of John Wood Group for $2.8bn, and rising prices will mean more demand for its services.GE also hopes that higher fuel costs will encourage customers to invest in its energy-saving equipment.Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said that a rising oil price “so long as it’s gradual, is a net positive …At the range it’s in, it’s not a real problem.”Similarly, Jim McNerney, the chief executive of Boeing, said on a call to analysts and media on Wednesday that “high-ish” oil prices could help push airlines towards buying his company’s fuel-efficient aircraft. However, he added: “The concern is if oil prices get to the point where it has a significant impact on overall economic activity.”So far, there has been little sign of that. Worldwide flight hours, for example – a key indicator for aerospace companies – rose by 5.8 per cent in the first quarter, to exceed their 2008 peak.Nor are interest rate rises in emerging economies such as Brazil and China yet having much effect on demand for US manufacturers’ products. Mr Cutler of Eaton said he remained “very positive” about those countries.While inflation has been rising in the US and Europe in recent months, it remains relatively subdued. Yet, in a world in which economic clout has shifted to Asia and Latin America, rising prices there could still be a significant threat.Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman in Chicago
24;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-04-26T19:20:03Z;S&P higher after strong US results;;A batch of strong results from leading US companies including Ford Motor, UPS and 3M helped push the S&P 500 index to its highest level since June 2008 in a sign of rising market confidence in spite of concerns about the world economy.Ford, the second-largest US car company by revenues, reported its highest quarterly profit for the period in 13 years, in the latest sign of the revival in US manufacturing.UPS, the logistics company, and 3M, the diversified manufacturer, raised their guidance for full-year earnings after first-quarter profits beat analysts’ expectations. Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor, also raised its full-year projection.The news follows excellent results from industrial companies such as United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell.Of the 154 constituents of the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the first quarter, 122 have delivered earnings ahead of average expectations, according to Bloomberg data.The S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent up at 1347 by midday in New York and up 7.1 per cent this year. The rally this year has been led by the energy sector, which has risen 16 per cent, followed by the industrial sector and healthcare, which are both up 10 per cent.The benchmark has nearly doubled from its low of 676 set in March 2009, during the financial crisis, but is still 14 per cent below its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007.Ford’s first-quarter earnings were $2.55bn, up 22 per cent on a year earlier and far ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company ascribed the rise to higher volumes and selling prices, as well as lower interest payments. Operating profits in Europe almost trebled, helped by new models.However, Alan Mulally, chief executive, said that despite the strong first quarter, Ford was sticking to earlier 2011 sales projections due to uncertainties.The company warned that results later in the year “may not be as strong as the first quarter”. It cited lower profits at Ford Credit, its financing arm, rising commodity prices and expanding investments, especially in emerging markets such as Russia, which Ford expects will be Europe’s biggest car market by 2015.Mr Mulally added however, that while new investments would push up costs, “they are also driving higher volumes, richer mix [of vehicles] and stronger transaction prices”.UPS also raised concerns about risks in the world economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.Ford shares climbed 2 per cent to about $15.90 at midday in New York, far above their lows of close to a dollar in late 2008, but still below January’s recent peak of almost $19.3M shares were also up about 2 per cent at $96.14, while UPS and Lockheed were both up about 1 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
25;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-04-21T21:39:24Z;Financial arm drives GE earnings growth;;General Electric, the industrial group, beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit.Pressure on margins at the company’s industrial businesses, particularly for energy equipment, was offset by GE Capital’s rebound from the effects of the financial crisis.GE’s shares closed down 2.2 per cent to $19.95 on Thursday.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said the results showed that the company had “emerged from the recession a stronger, more competitive company,” adding that its leadership “remain confident in GE’s 2011 framework”.The company also announced the third increase in its dividend in the past year.The results follow strong reports other US industrial groups including United Technologies, Honeywell and Eaton, all of which raised their guidance on expected earnings for the year.GE also reported that its tax rate, a subject of controversy in the US following claims that the company paid no federal taxes last year, had risen sharply.Pre-tax profits from continuing operations more than doubled to $7.4bn, up from $2.8bn in the equivalent quarter of 2010, but the provision for tax payments rose even faster, from $443m to $3.9bn, because of tax payable on the sale of a 51 per cent stake in NBC Universal to Comcast.That left net income from continuing operations up 48 per cent at $3.51bn, and diluted earnings per share also up 48 per cent at $0.31.Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, said he expected the tax rate for GE’s industrial businesses to be about 20 per cent for the year as a whole, and GE Capital’s rate to be in the “mid teens”, compared to 17 per cent for the industrial business and a substantial tax benefit recorded by GE Capital in 2010.As has been the case in recent quarters, the strongest contribution to profit growth came from the rebound in GE Capital, where profit more than tripled to $1.84bn thanks to lower provisions for losses.In the first quarter, GE Capital exceeded the maximum of 40 per cent that Mr Immelt has targeted for its proportion of the company’s earnings, providing a little over half of group post-tax earnings. The company expects that proportion to drop back to the 40 per cent range for the year as a whole.The group’s industrial businesses, which Mr Immelt has tried to stress as more important to the group’s future, posted organic revenue growth of 5 per cent, to $20.4bn, but pre-tax profits were up only 1 per cent, at $2.98bn.Mr Sherin said that in aerospace and other markets where GE matched other US groups, such as United Technologies and Honeywell, it had benefited from the same global market strength.However, some GE divisions, particularly energy infrastructure, generally see pick up demand later in the economic cycle.Energy infrastructure, which includes gas and wind turbines for power generation and equipment for oil and gas production, was the weakest division: profits fell 7 per cent to $1.38bn. The company said prices had been under pressure for wind turbines, and new acquisitions had also squeezed margins.GE has been aggressively adding to its energy equipment business, buying companies including Dresser and the well support unit of John Wood Group. The acquisition announced in March of Converteam, a manufacturer of power conversion equipment, will bring total spending to about $11bn.Mr Sherin said the company planned no more large deals for the rest of 2011.The quarterly dividend was raised by 1 cent to 15 cents a share, payable to shareholders on the register as of June 20. It is still less than half the peak quarterly payment of 31 cents before the financial crisis in 2008.The stock has added 7.4 per cent in value over the past year, compared to a 10.4 per cent rise for the S&P 500 index.
26;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-04-21T20:30:41Z;Dow Jones hits 33-month high;;A slew of strong earnings reports from big industry names such as Apple and General Electric helped boost Wall Street for another session and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 33-month high.Apple’s second-quarter results blew past forecasts, with the company posting a 95 per cent jump in earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. The technology giant reported earnings of $5.99bn in the quarter, or $6.40 a share, sharply ahead of the $5.37 expected by analysts.The results were helped by strong sales in iPhones and Mac computers, but the company said that it was struggling to produce enough of its latest version of the iPad to meet demand. Shares in the company closed up 2.4 per cent to $350.69 on Thursday.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Qualcomm climbed 3 per cent to $56.94 after the world’s leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales reported second-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share, exceeding the 80 cents expected by analysts.The company also raised its 2011 forecasts significantly as it eyed an expansion into tablets, e-readers and home consumer electronics.These bumper results pushed the S&P technology index up 1 per cent, adding to the 2.4 per cent jump the previous session following similarly strong results from Intel and IBM.This led Wall Street higher on Thursday, helping the S&P 500 index close 0.5 per cent higher at 1,337.38 in low volume trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,505.84, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,820.16.The S&P 500 and the Dow were both up 1.3 per cent over the week.Sentiment was held back slightly after the Philadelphia Fed announced that its index of regional business activity fell to 18.5 in April, down from 43.4 in March and below the 35 expected. Separately, the number of weekly jobless claims declined, but by less than expected, and the previous week’s figures were revised up.In the industrial sector, General Electric beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 15 cents, the third dividend increase in the last year.But investors had been hoping for even more and the stock was down 2.2 per cent to $19.95. The stock had been up 1.8 per cent on the week before the results as sentiment in the industrial sector was higher following strong results from other key players.In the previous session, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, reported forecast-beating earnings while Eaton and Honeywell also reported strong results.Looking to the financial sector, shares in Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $26.48 after the investment bank also reported forecast-beating quarterly results. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding some items, were 46 cents a share, compared with the 40 cents expected by analysts.While the results beat expectations, in absolute terms they were less impressive. MorganStanley reported a 48 per cent drop in first-quarter profits as its joint brokerage venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group posted a $1.8bn annual loss and revenue from fixed-income trading fell by a third.Earnings results so far for the financial sector have been mixed. Goldman Sachs reported strong results on Tuesday, powered by strong revenues from its investing and lending divisions. But other results from Wells Fargo and Bank of America have been more disappointing, with results weighed down by troubled mortgage operations.Elsewhere on Wall Street, F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 7.2 per cent to $106.87 after reporting a 68 per cent boost to second-quarter profit and raising its earnings forecast for the current quarter above analysts’ expectations.Shares in McDonald’s fell 1.9 per cent to $76.91 after the restaurant chain warned that higher food costs could cut into margins, while its earnings came in ahead of analysts’ estimates with an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Verizon Communications slid 2.3 per cent to $36.91 after its first-quarter profit more than tripled, but its average revenue per user rose by less than analysts had expected.
27;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-04-21T01:08:08Z;Industrial groups upbeat despite global troubles;;"Three of the largest US industrial groups, United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell, posted strong first-quarter results and raised guidance for expected earnings growth, in a sign of rising confidence in the world economy.United Technologies, the aerospace and buildings equipment group, reported a 17 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, led by a strong performance at its Carrier air-conditioning unit.Eaton, which makes electrical equipment and components for vehicles and aircraft, reported an 80 per cent increase in earnings per share, with particularly strong growth from its hydraulics and truck component businesses.Both companies said markets were growing more strongly than they had expected, in spite of threats posed by rising prices for oil and other commodities, inflation in key emerging economies and the effects of the devastating earthquake in Japan.Connecticut-based United Technologies reported pre-tax income of $1.63bn for the first quarter, up 21 per cent from the equivalent period of 2010, and earnings of $1.11 per share, up 19 per cent.The company, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Sikorsky helicopters and other aerospace and building systems, raised its full-year earnings forecast by 5 cents to a range of $5.25-$5.40 per share, representing 11-14 per cent growth on 2010. It also said it expected full-year sales to be 5 per cent higher at about $57bn.Greg Hayes, the chief financial officer, said: “Across the business, everything has been doing better than we expected and the downside risks just haven’t materialised.”One particularly strong point was the Carrier air-conditioning business, where operating profit more than doubled to an underlying $324m. It was one of the businesses that was early into the downturn in 2008 and is now rebounding, driven by demand from industrial customers.Eaton improved its pre-tax income by 79 per cent to $335m, on sales up 23 per cent to $3.8bn.This year the company’s US markets, which account for about 45 per cent of revenues, are growing faster than its non-US business, in particular because of a sharp recovery in the North American truck market.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said: “We are seeing a broad capital spending-based recovery coming out of the deep credit-driven recession of 2008-09 … And this is not just a story about a rebound in 2010-11; we are in a multiple-year expansion.”Eaton raised its earnings guidance to a midpoint of $3.81 per share for the full year, implying growth of 34-45 per cent from 2010.Honeywell, which makes parts for aircraft and vehicles as well as industrial equipment, reported a 40 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to 88 cents per share, and talked about a “particularly robust finish to the quarter.”Dave Cote, the company’s chief executive, added: “Orders in our short-cycle businesses have now increased eight consecutive quarters and our long-cycle backlog continues at near record levels. As a result of our strong first quarter and continued favourable outlook for our major markets, we’re raising our 2011 sales and EPS guidance.”The new earnings guidance is for earnings per share of $3.80-$3.95 for 2011, implying underlying growth of 27-32 per cent from 2010.United Technologies closed up 4 per cent at $85.90 and Eaton rose 2 per cent to $53.50. Honeywell’s results were announced after the market had closed, but the shares were up 2 per cent to $60 in after-hours trading."
28;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-02-06T20:56:13Z;US recovery gets push in right direction;;"Demand for capital equipment in the US is starting to pick up strongly, manufacturers say, boosting confidence in the health of the economic recovery and raising hopes of a revival in American industry.Comments in recent days from many of the leading manufacturers of capital goods – including factory equipment, earthmovers and truck components – have suggested that while the fastest growth is still likely to be in emerging economies, they also expect significant growth in US sales.Emerson, the Missouri-based manufacturer of industrial equipment, told investors at the end of last week that it expected non-residential investment in the US to grow by 8-9 per cent this year; as much as the average for emerging markets.The company said it expected that the pressure to cut costs and expand capacity would encourage many industries to raise their capital spending this year – and companies that cut investment sharply during the downturn would be forced to catch up, replacing worn-out and obsolete equipment.David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, which makes aircraft and vehicle components and industrial equipment, told the Financial Times: “I do believe the US economy is more resilient now. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we’re on the comeback trail.”Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, is raising its capital spending budget from $1.7bn in 2010 to $3bn this year. More than half of the budget will be spent in the US to build capacity, going towards projects such as an excavator factory in Texas and a motor-grader facility in Arkansas.“If you look at our 2011 outlook, it’s still with the US, Europe and Japan well off historical peaks,” Ed Rapp, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, told the FT. “So, in this cycle, we have tried to get ahead of some of that, to put the investment in place now. That way when we get a more robust recovery in the developed world, we’ll be ready.”Eaton, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, has said it expected its US sales to grow faster than its international sales this year. Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, told the FT that demand was “far stronger than people had thought it would be”.The Institute of Supply Management survey released last week pointed to the fastest rate of growth for manufacturing industry since 2004.Barry Knapp, strategist at Barclays Capital, said two factors contributed to the upturn in confidence since last summer: the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying programme and signs of a more business-friendly approach from Congress."
29;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-27T22:52:13Z;Caterpillar forecasts record profits in 2011;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, expects to make record profits this year as rising commodity prices fuel a surge in demand for mining equipment in emerging markets and the construction industry in developed economies replaces ageing equipment.The industrial bellwether and Dow component said on Thursday it anticipated revenues in 2011 would exceed $50bn, compared to $42.6bn last year, while net profits would hit a record of “near $6 per share”, up from $4.15 per share in 2010.The company said it would allot $3bn to capital spending this year – almost twice last year’s capex budget of $1.7bn – with more than half of the spending in the US, as Caterpillar builds capacity.In China, where the company is also ramping up capacity, Caterpillar said it would produce 60 per cent more excavators in the country this year than in 2010 and would raise excavator production to 24,000 units by 2013, a fourfold increase from last year.“These investments in our future will add cost in the short term but are essential to be prepared for continued growth as the economic environment improves,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive.Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations, said Caterpillar had become “somewhat more positive” in recent months about sales in developed economies and predicted that as the economy recovered, customers would start to replace older machines.“Customer fleets have deteriorated over the past few years,” he said. “End-users in the US, Europe and Japan cut their machine purchases more than construction activity declined, particularly in 2008 and 2009.”Caterpillar made the projections as it unveiled quarterly earnings that easily beat Wall Street’s expectations. The company made a net profit of $968m or $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $232m or 36 cents per share in the same period a year earlier and above analysts’ average forecasts of $1.27 per share.Sales and revenues were $12.8bn, up from $7.9bn a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $11.6bn.The results demonstrate how the boom in commodity prices is feeding into equipment-makers’ performance. Caterpillar’s earnings came after Komatsu, the Japanese heavy-equipment maker that is its main global rival, raised its profits outlook on Thursday and reported that earnings in the three months to December more than tripled from the prior year, on strong demand for construction and mining equipment in China and Indonesia.Caterpillar said that excluding acquisitions, it had hired back 19,000 workers of the roughly 37,000 positions it cut during the economic downturn. It said 7,500 of the new workers were hired in the US, representing a 15 per cent increase in its US workforce. Caterpillar shares were up 0.8 per cent at $96.51 in afternoon trade.Separately, Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton Corp, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, said he thought the danger of a “double-dip” downturn in the US economy was “very distant”, as his company reported strong results for last year and said earnings could grow by up to 38 per cent this year. Eaton’s pre-tax profits of $1.04bn for 2010 were more than triple their 2009 level, on revenues up 19 per cent at $13.7bn. Earnings per share more than doubled, to $5.46 in 2010 from $2.27 the previous year.The company raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to 68 cents for the first quarter of 2011, which Mr Cutler said was “an indicator of our fundamental confidence and the visibility in our markets, and a sign that Eaton’s strategy is really working”.
30;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-27T17:43:50Z;Eaton looks for acquisitions;;Eaton Corp, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, reported an “outstanding” fourth quarter of last year and said earnings could grow by up to 38 per cent this year, thanks to strong growth in its markets in the US and around the world.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, also said the company was now looking more actively for acquisitions than it had in the past few years.Pre-tax profits of $1.04bn for 2010 were more than triple their 2009 level, on revenues up 19 per cent at $13.7bn. Earnings per share were more than doubled, to $5.46 in 2010 from $2.27 the previous year.The dividend for the year was up 8 per cent at $2.16 per share. Eaton also announced a two-for-one share split.The company expects some slowdown in its markets this year compared to 2010, from about 10 per cent to about 8 per cent growth, as the world economy moves from a recovery to more steady expansion. There was a particularly sharp rebound in some of Eaton’s markets coming out of the downturn, with hydraulic equipment, for example, going through a “v-shaped” bounce back, it said.However, Mr Cutler said all six of Eaton’s business segments – electrical equipment in the US and the rest of the world, hydraulic equipment and components for aircraft, trucks and cars – would benefit from growth in US and internationally.For some US industrial companies, growth in world markets has been stronger than in America, but in 2011 Eaton expects the US to outpace its non-US markets. While emerging economy growth is still very strong, and Eaton reached $1.1bn sales in China last year, developed economy markets such as European countries have been sluggish.Economists have predicted a “three-speed recovery” this year, with Europe showing the slowest growth.Signs of a stronger upturn in the US include the truck market in North America, which was very badly hit by the recession, but where “we really are starting to see a recovery,” Mr Cutler said.The US aerospace industry has been hit by concerns over cuts to the defence budget, and Lockheed Martin, the largest US military contractor, predicted on Thursday that its earnings would fall this year. However, Mr Cutler said there was a “very different dynamic between the defence side and the commercial side” of the aircraft parts business, with the civil side growing very strongly.He added that he did not expect rising costs to hit profits this year, saying: “We expect margin expansion in spite of commodity price pressures.”Speaking on an investor conference call, Mr Cutler also said Eaton was looking for more acquisitions, and its balance sheet was in good shape to do deals.He said a large deal was possible, although smaller acquisitions were more likely.“I would not take that [a large takeover] off the table, but I also don’t want to say that is necessarily where we are going to end up,” he said.
31;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-21T18:40:27Z;GE and Google earnings lift Wall Street;;Strong results from General Electric lifted sentiment on Wall Street, providing a boost at the end of an uneven weekGeneral Electric, the largest US industrial group, posted a 51 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit, lifting the industrial sector and providing direction for the wider markets. The conglomerate rose 7.1 per cent to $19.74, a two-year high.The news boosted the sector, with Eaton, a manufacturing group, up 2.2 per cent to $102.45 and 3M gaining 1.4 per cent to $89.29. The S&P industrial index rose 1.2 per cent to 311.03.This helped the S&P 500 index close 0.2 per cent higher at 1,283.35, with the index trading 0.8 per cent lower for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,871.84, up 0.7 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,689.54, down 2.4 per cent on the week.In the financial sector, Bank of America lost ground after reporting a loss in the fourth-quarter due to a $2bn charge related to its mortgage loans business. The nation’s biggest bank by assets posted a loss of $1.24bn compared with a year-earlier loss of $194m. Excluding the writedown, it would have earned $756m or 4 cents per share.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of 14 cents a share. The stock was down 2 per cent to $14.25 on the news. But this did not drag down the wider financial sector thanks to strong gains from the regional banks.The S&P regional banks index was up 2.5 per cent to 54.25 led by SunTrust Bank, which added 5.9 per cent to $29.50 after posting strong results.The technology sector was dominated by news of a series of high-level personnel changes among the leading companies.Hewlett-Packard, the world’s top-selling tech company, announced that four of its directors were stepping down. The shake-up means that the board will be mostly made up of those who were not involved in the decision to oust chief executive Mark Hurd, whose controversial departure knocked $10bn off the company’s market value. The stock closed flat at $50.63.Google lost ground after announcing on Thursday evening that Eric Schmidt was stepping down as chief executive, with co-founder Larry Page taking over in April. The search engine provider and technology group also posted blockbuster earnings results, but these failed to lift the stock which fell 2.4 per cent to $611.83.Google posted profits of $2.9bn or $8.75 a share after the closing bell on Thursday. This was up from $2.2bn or $6.79 a share last year and ahead of the $8.09 per forecast by analysts.The S&P technology index was down 0.6 per cent to 446.36. These high-level changes come in the wake of news earlier in the week that Steve Jobs was taking a medical leave of absence as chief executive officer of Apple, prompting the stock to lose 6.2 per cent to $326.72 over the week.Elsewhere, Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, fell 2.1 per cent to $83.48 as investors were disappointed by earnings results. The company posted fourth-quarter net income of $1.16bn, or 85 cents per share, only slightly ahead of the 83 cents forecasted by analysts.The week as a whole on Wall Street was dominated by earnings reports, particularly from the financial sector. The S&P financials index had risen 3.2 per cent in the previous week on the expectation of strong results, particularly after JPMorgan posted strong results at the end of that week.But, by and large, the earnings disappointed the markets with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York Mellon, Wells Fargo and Bank of America Merrill Lynch all posting lacklustre results, sending the sector lower. All of these banks were down over the week.Strong results from Morgan Stanley on Thursday helped limit the losses, but the S&P financials index was still down 1.7 per cent over the week.The technology sector also dominated earnings news, with the industry’s leading groups all posting strong results. IBM was up 3.7 per cent over the week to $155.50 after healthy results while Ebay was up 2.9 per cent to $30.02.Overall, the strong results failed to lift the sector. The S&P technology index lost 3.8 per cent on the week.Looking at economic data, the week saw good manufacturing data and unemployment figures, which lifted hopes for a strong economic recovery.On the macro side, equities were weighed down mid-week by fears that China would seek of cool down their booming economy after the country saw strong GDP growth.
32;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-14T01:21:17Z;GE deal accelerates push into energy;;General Electric has made its first move into the fast-growing business of cutting electricity consumption by the telecoms and computer industries, buying Lineage Power for $520m from The Gores Group, a private equity firm.The deal is GE’s third acquisition of an energy business in the past three months, as the group implements its plan to focus on infrastructure markets and reduce its reliance on financial services.Last October, GE agreed a $3bn deal to buy Dresser of the US, which makes engines, pumps and valves for the oil and gas industry, and in December it announced the $1.2bn acquisition of Wellstream, a UK-based oil services company.Texas-based Lineage provides energy-efficient power supply equipment for data centres and towers used for cloud computing and mobile web services.John Krenicki, chief executive of GE Energy, described it as a further step in GE’s development from its traditional base in turbines for power generation, focused on the US, to being a global supplier of advanced equipment such as “smart grid” technology. The deal also reflects the changing global conditions for the clean energy business. Rising unemployment and the failure of climate talks have damaged the prospects for renewable energy in some countries and encouraged greater emphasis on environmentally-friendly technologies.Other US groups have been developing energy-saving products, including Ohio-based Eaton, which also provides equipment to cut power use by data centres.Although Lineage is relatively small compared with GE, which has a market capitalisation of about $200bn, Mr Krenicki said it had excellent technology “that could be globalised in a big way”. He said GE had good relationships with many of the IT and telecoms companies that would be Lineage’s principal customers. He added that GE was paying a “reasonable” valuation for Lineage, at eight times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Lineage has been principally active in the US, but the rapid growth in internet traffic and mobile devices is fuelling concern about the IT industry’s energy consumption.
33;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-11T19:24:38Z;BAE Systems drops Platform Solutions sale;;BAE Systems has shelved plans to sell one of its US divisions, depriving it of an expected £1bn that could have been used to make acquisitions.The company announced in September that it had hired Wells Fargo and JPMorgan to examine a possible sale of the Platform Solutions division, which had been built up from several smaller parts of other businesses acquired by BAE over the past 10 years.Based in upstate New York and employing 4,300 people, Platform Solutions makes propulsion systems for trains, as well as engine control systems for aircraft and helmet-mounted displays for British pilots on Lynx military helicopters.The division’s hybrid-electric propulsion systems are also being trialled on Alexander Dennis public buses in Oxford, London and Manchester.“In spite of considerable expressions of interest, no sale has yet been agreed,” BAE said. “It has been concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the group or its Platform Solutions business to extend this lengthy period of uncertainty and a sale of the business is no longer being pursued.”BAE declined to reveal the identity of the bidders but rumours have focused on three US groups: the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, and the industrial conglomerates General Electric and Eaton Corporation. Rockwell Collins, the US-based aviation engineering group, was also a rumoured bidder.BAE also did not disclose the size of bids received, although analysts estimated that the group was seeking as much as £1bn ($1.55bn) for the division. Last year, the division made revenues of £789m or about 4 per cent of group sales.“From BAE’s point of view, Platform Solutions wasn’t a strategic fit with the rest of their business because it was the rump from various bits and pieces they aggregated over the years and bundled together,” said Edward Stacey, an analyst at Execution Noble-Espirito Santo.“So it was not a must-have for them, but on the other hand it was not a must-dispose either because they have no debt, so they didn’t need to monetise an asset.”Some of the proceeds from the sale were likely to have been used to continue the group’s acquisitions programme, which has been boosted in recent years by the purchase of cyber defence group Detica and to buy out a joint venture partner.The remainder could have been used to pay down some of the group’s pension deficit or fund a share buy-back, reprising a strategy adopted last year when the company announced a £500m buy-back programme.Shares in BAE Systems closed down 0.4p at 340p on Tuesday.
34;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
35;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-10T22:07:06Z;Routes to an overseas presence;;Get out more. This may sound an implausible plan of action for a business leader. Yet for the new head of Rohm, a Japanese electronics company presided over for 56 years by an extremely reclusive manager, this simple idea represents both a radical shift and the basis for his vision for the company.The change in approach by Satoshi Sawamura, the new president of Rohm, pictured above, has been instituted in the nine months since he took over from Ken Sato, the former violinist who started the company in 1954. Known for his shyness, Mr Sato disliked travel. The rest of the company took its lead from him, which meant that Rohm, while known for its innovative approach to new products, developed an introverted focus with most of its sales coming from Japan-based customers.“Because of my [sales] background, I am naturally keen on communication,” says the 60-year-old Mr Sawamura, over green tea in Rohm’s headquarters in Kyoto. “I intend to spend a lot of my time away from the head office, talking to customers, especially international ones.”Mr Sawamura’s efforts to make Rohm more international reflect the challenges faced by many companies: how to manage the transition from a largely domestic enterprise to a global one. The experiences of Rohm, Eaton, the US industrial conglomerate, and Exwold, a small chemical processing company based in north-east England, reveal three strategies at shaking up a company.For Mr Sawamura, a change in management style has been the most important shift at Rohm. He describes his predecessor politely – Mr Sato anointed the younger man as his chosen successor before retiring in his late 70s – as a “big influence”.But he also suggests that one thing the Rohm founder was not so good at was winning a non-Japanese following. The company has been “late” to the idea of becoming more global, he says.Mr Sato’s dislike of meeting people meant that not only was he rarely seen outside his office at Rohm, but he usually declined to visit customers, even those based a short train ride from Kyoto.Of Rohm’s sales in 2009-10 of Y335bn ($4bn), 70 per cent came from big Japanese electronics groups including Sony, Sharp and Panasonic. This figure includes purchases by their manufacturing bases elsewhere in Asia. Mr Sawamura wants the company’s sales to non-Japanese groups to expand to half the total by 2015.In addition to a more outgoing approach, Mr Sawamura is keen to make the most of Rohm’s acquisitions of three internationally oriented companies that were completed at a cost of almost $1bn since late 2008, in the closing stages of Mr Sato’s tenure. Thanks to one of those deals – the purchase of Japan-based Oki Semiconductor – Rohm is for the first time working on joint projects with Intel, the US microchip maker. Rohm also bought two smaller companies, SiCrystal of Germany and the US’s Kionix, which make semiconductor materials and motion sensors, respectively. Both businesses have most of their sales in parts of the world outside Asia and will bring to Rohm new perspectives and ideas, Mr Sawamura says.While Mr Sawamura is still envisioning what he might achieve, Sandy Cutler can already look back at enormous change. Mr Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, took on his role in 2000. At that time, the company’s products were predominantly car and truck components, with 80 per cent of its $8bn revenues coming from the US.Since then, Eaton has made about 50 acquisitions and almost as many divestments. Only about 20 per cent of its revenues of roughly $13.5bn last year came from its former business of vehicle parts. The rest were derived from a broad range of power management products, from specialised hydraulics equipment to guidance systems for aircraft.All these new areas, says Mr Cutler, feature more specialised products and technologies in which there are fewer competitors than the company’s previous automotive-based business. They are also sold on a much more global basis: in 2010, the proportion of sales coming from the US had shrunk to 45 per cent. A quarter of sales, meanwhile, came from emerging markets such as China, Brazil and eastern Europe. “We have rebuilt the company,” Mr Cutler says.To make the “new” Eaton work, Mr Cutler has filled some top jobs with people who have more of an international outlook. Some of them arrived with the larger acquisitions. Also important has been to reorient the company’s management structure to ensure that the balance in decision-making is tilted away from Eaton’s Cleveland, Ohio headquarters.Of Eaton’s nine top managers with day-to-day operational responsibilities in the company’s four broad product divisions, five are based outside the US – in China, Switzerland or Brazil. “You cannot have an agile international company where all the decisions are made by the head office,” says Mr Cutler.In contrast to the heads of the two Japanese and US companies, James Robson designed his company from the start to be a multinational – even though it is a minnow compared with most businesses des­cribed in this way.The 50-year-old former mining engineer set up Exwold, based near Hartlepool outside Newcastle, in 1992 after accruing experience in the chemicals industry. His goal was to exploit a specialised granulation technique, devised in Japan, to reduce the amount of agrochemicals spread on crops by up to a hundredfold.After an initial contract with Monsanto, the US chemicals group, the 70-strong Exwold has expanded to sales of £5m ($7.8m) last year, with 90 per cent of the revenues from customers based outside the UK. These are mainly other large chemical businesses that send materials to Exwold for processing.The process – in which Exwold has just a handful of competitors – works by packing a relatively large amount of active chemicals such as a pesticide or special nutrient into tiny particles. The process chimes with policymakers’ and companies’ goals of reducing the volume of chemicals that are applied to crops and making them safer to handle.“I knew from the beginning that if the business was to succeed it had to operate on a global basis,” says Mr Robson, strategy director at Exwold, of which he owns just over a fifth with the remainder held by other individuals and private investment groups.The way to achieve global reach from the start, he says, was to hire managers with a lot of exposure to dealing with big companies and who “speak the language” of the corporate world. “We do our utmost to punch above our weight,” says Mr Robson. “We have health and environmental standards just like any you would find in a big company, and we are open and honest with the companies we deal with. When the large companies ask us our advice we tell them what we think, even if they are things they don’t necessarily want to hear.”The strategy can lead to Exwold debating with its customers over a particular process for the granulation if it thinks there is a better way. Mr Robson says that contributing in this way is not always immediately appreciated but that over time it leads to an “atmosphere of respect”.Partly on the basis of this – and also because of the high demand that is expected for the kind of processes developed by Exwold in crop protection – he reckons that the company could double its sales in the next five years, with virtually all the growth coming from overseas.What knits together Mr Robson’s ideas with those of the two larger companies is that all three have a common aim of having a big enough pool of potential customers to be able to present products and solutions with maximum effect.Even in a world economy of growing interconnectedness, going global is unlikely to be an easy ride – but these three approaches indicate how it might be done.
36;ETN;Eaton Corp;2011-01-06T20:33:08Z;America: Riveting prospects;US industry is retraining its sights on manufacturing and exports;"At the Middle River Aircraft Systems plant on the unglamorous outskirts of Baltimore, the past, present and future of American industry are on display.In the second world war, the factory was a powerhouse of the industrial strength that brought victory to the Allies, producing thousands of B-26 Marauder bombers for the US Air Force. It claims to have inspired the legend of Rosie the Riveter, the emblematic figure representing millions of women drawn into the manufacturing workforce during the war.Now owned by General Electric, the plant is also celebrating more recent success, hiring 200 workers to make thrust reversers – aircraft brakes – for Boeing’s latest version of the jumbo jet, the 747-8. It has also won a contract to supply components for the Comac C919, the new Chinese airliner intended to take on Airbus and Boeing.Sagar Patel, the president of GE’s aircraft parts business, says the plant has faced tough conditions but “we have to have the vision to weather those economic challenges”.In a tentative US recovery, the Middle River plant is a small portent of a possible brighter future, with firmer foundations than the mortgage-fuelled consumer spree of the 2000s.Battered by the economic collapse triggered by the financial and property sectors, American business and political leaders are hoping to rebuild growth and employment based less on consumption, construction, debt and imports, and more on production, manufacturing, earnings and exports. An industrial revival in the US could also help correct the international imbalances that underlie global economic instability.However, the views of the heads of some of America’s largest manufacturers suggest there are deep structural reasons why rebuilding US production will be long and difficult.With unemployment at 9.8 per cent and rising, the dream of restoring US industrial greatness – what Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, has called “American renewal”– has widespread appeal. In a speech last year, Mr Immelt criticised the assumption that “America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy, and somehow still expect to prosper.” He added: “We need to make products here, and have the self-confidence to sell them around the world.”Other chief executives share that dream. Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, the largest US chemicals group, tells the Financial Times: “What this government, or any government in the United States, needs to do is work on an advanced manufacturing sector …What you have to do is create competitiveness on a global basis for your US-based companies.” He has even written a book on the subject, Make it in America: the Case for Re-Inventing the Economy, published next week.President Barack Obama has bought into the idea, setting a target of doubling US exports in the next five years that will require a vigorous revival in manufacturing. He also appointed an advisory export council well-stocked with manufacturers and chaired by Jim McNerny, the chief executive of Boeing.The world certainly offers opportunities, with rapid growth in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil creating increased demand for everything from drinks cans to airliners.As Mr Liveris puts it, the world is entering a “golden age” for manufacturing, and American companies are seeing some of the benefit. Eaton, which makes industrial equipment and parts for vehicles and aircraft, and Caterpillar, which makes earthmovers, are just two examples of groups that have been reporting strong growth in emerging market demand. The latest trade figures show US exports for 2010 to October were 15 per cent higher in real terms than in the equivalent period of 2009; for the first time, emerging economies will last year have taken more than half of US exports.However, other countries’ shipments to the US have been rising equally fast. The International Monetary Fund believes that the US current account deficit widened last year, while Japan and Germany, which are both running surpluses, moved deeper into the black. Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, says that while the US is similar to other developed economies in its propensity to import, it has been uniquely poor at exporting manufactured goods.The traditional culprit in any story about US export failure is the overvalued dollar, which has been an international hot topic again recently as tensions flared over China’s intervention to hold down the renminbi.It is true that the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency of choice has tended to support its value, hurting US exporters. But the National Association of Manufacturers, a business group, argues that the dollar is now about 10 per cent below its trade-weighted average in real terms over the past four decades, suggesting that the exchange rate is not now the most pressing issue. The problems for US manufacturing, industry executives argue, have very deep roots.The first is that with the world’s largest national market as their home base, American businesses are simply unused to selling internationally. Only about 1 per cent of US companies export, according to the commerce department, fewer than in any other developed economy. Of those, 58 per cent sell to only one other country. Frank Vargo of the NAM says: “We are not a robust exporter and we never have been.”Second, the US has been less active than other countries in signing agreements to facilitate international trade. There are 262 trade agreements around the world and a further 100 under negotiation, according to the US Chamber of Commerce, but the US has signed only 17 and is involved in just one current set of talks. US businesses have welcomed the latest trade deal, with South Korea, but argued that successive administrations should have moved much faster to sign such pacts.American exports are particularly severely affected by tariff barriers; in the World Economic Forum’s ranking of exporting countries by “tariffs faced”, the US ranks eighth highest out of 121.A third problem for US manufacturers is an insufficiently skilled and educated workforce. Mr McNerny of Boeing warns that in spite of high unemployment, his company and others are starting to run up against skills shortages that “threaten to spiral us into a vicious circle” of shrinking capacity. “If we allow our industrial base to fall into disrepair, opportunities for good jobs will dwindle …we will have to close production lines,” he said last month. “At the same time, without a strong pipeline of future talent, companies won’t have the capacity to pursue new opportunities, create the next innovation in aerospace or develop new market segments, which will cause the US industrial base to deteriorate further.”Fourth, as emerging economies acquire modern facilities and skills, they are increasingly capable of replacing production in US and other developed countries. Louis Chênevert, the chief executive of United Technologies, manufacturer of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis lifts, says that by 2013 he plans to source 40 per cent of the company’s components from low-cost economies such as Poland, Mexico and China, up from 15 per cent in 2001.The most fundamental issue, however, is that large US companies generally want to manufacture in the markets where they sell. The US is the world’s largest outward investor and American companies earn much more from their foreign operations than from exports. The revenues of US-owned foreign affiliates were about $5,000bn in 2008, according to the Chamber of Commerce – almost three times the value of US exports of goods and services.When American manufacturers look at emerging economies, they often decide it would be better to build plants close to the market. That is not solely, or even primarily, for reasons of cost but also to help them understand local needs, improve logistics, protect against currency volatility, meet local regulations and improve relations with governments that are often their largest customers.Sandy Cutler, the chief executive of Eaton, suggests the “model has changed” for US manufacturers. “That was a 1950s view of the world: that you could do all the manufacture in one area, and the rest of the world wouldn’t be competitive, so you’d ship your products there,” he says. “[Now] the world has developed. Both emerging and other developed nations are quite sophisticated today, so we need to be there competing.”For Martin Richenhagen, chief executive of Agco, the Georgia-based manufacturer of Massey Ferguson and other agricultural equipment, Mr Obama’s plan to double exports is “another proof that the American government doesn’t understand business”. He explains: “Most of the big US companies don’t export: they produce outside the US …We export some. But most of the product we sell in Brazil is built in Brazil. Most of the product we sell in Europe is built in Europe.”Even Mr Immelt says: “There is no better marketing than a factory with jobs,” adding that eventually he expects GE’s sales in China to be “completely localised”. Clean energy technology, for example, is one of GE’s great hopes for future growth. Last September it announced a plan for its Chinese wind turbine joint venture to build a factory in Jiangsu province to produce offshore turbines, the most technically challenging part of the wind market.In order to offset all those inhibiting factors, the scale of currency adjustment needed would probably be prohibitively damaging to the rest of the economy. Mr Cutler of Eaton argues that sales in world markets will create good jobs in the US, even if production is overseas.“Having our headquarters in the US means that many of the supervisory jobs for global co-ordination, global R&D investment, the management of the company, are here,” he says. “And that means that we’re not only hiring people in our own company, but we have a multiplier effect on the economy in terms of the consultants we hire, our outside accountants [and] outside attorneys.”Mary Andringa, another member of the president’s export council, makes the case that international operations help companies export from their US plants. She heads Vermeer, an Iowa-based manufacturer of agricultural and earthmoving equipment, which assembles products in its international markets but ships 25-50 per cent of the components from its factories in the US. “It doesn’t have to be either/or; it can be both,” she says.Nevertheless, even recovering the 2m manufacturing jobs lost during the recession looks like a tall order. GE’s Middle River aircraft parts plant employs just 1,000 even after the latest hirings, compared with a peak of 53,000 in the days of Rosie the Riveter. Mr Immelt and Mr Liveris advocate government support for a few “strategic” industries, such as clean energy, to stimulate innovation and help develop skills. But with the Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, such initiatives can be expected to drop off the agenda.Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University predicts that US manufacturing will be boosted, and global imbalances will shrink, as China and India invest in the infrastructure they need. Rising costs in China and other emerging economies will also help the competitive position of US industry.But those forces could take a long time to work through. As Mr Vargo at the NAM puts it: “The future is not yet written; it is not black. But it could be disappointing.”Additional reporting by Jeremy LemerEconomists vs industrialists: the backlash against the factory ‘fetish’American factory output is higher than it has ever been, and the country is still the world’s largest manufacturer, but the sector’s share of gross domestic product has been steadily shrinking.In the early 1950s it was almost 30 per cent, roughly the same as that of China today. It is now about 11 per cent, down from 15 per cent in 1998.Opinions about that decline typically set economists against industrialists. For industry leaders, manufacturing matters more than other sectors because of its dominance of international trade, and because it offers higher wages than many service sectors such as retail and catering.“No country as economically mature, large and diverse as America can prosper with only 8 per cent of workers in the manufacturing sector, which is what our number is today,” says Leo Hindery, the former chief executive of AT&T Broadband, now at the New America Foundation, a centrist think-tank.“It needs to be at least 20 per cent and more like 25 per cent. Otherwise only repeated consumer-credit driven bubbles can – temporarily – sustain the economy, until of course they burst.”Economists, on the other hand, often reject the idea that any sector deserves special treatment. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University argues that the focus on manufacturing is a “fetish” that can lead to damaging policies such as protectionism or wasteful subsidies. He points out that many service industries offer higher wages than manufacturing, and that services are increasingly tradeable internationally.Lawrence Summers, former head of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, was the most prominent advocate of that view in the administration, arguing that the US was making a natural progression to a “knowledge and service economy”.It is true that average wages in manufacturing, at about $33,300 per year, are well below the American average of about $43,500. However, they are significantly higher than those in some industries, such as food preparation ($22,100 per year) or building maintenance ($25,000).The issue is the quality of the jobs created to replace those lost from manufacturing – and the record is mixed. One of the largest growth sectors has been health and education, with employment up 3.7m in the past decade to 16.5m. This includes a wide range of occupations, from skilled practitioners (average pay $69,700) to support staff ($26,700)."
37;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-12-27T18:13:03Z;Eaton chief hits out at Beijing’s critics;;Criticism of China for its role in favouring local industry at the expense of US companies has gone too far and could lead to a dangerous bout of trade protectionism, according to Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, US industrial conglomerate, for the past 10 years.He said that some of the criticism of China by US industrialists and politicians over actions such as currency manipulation was the result of “national jealousy” in the US about China’s relatively buoyant economy.In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: “There is a strand of political thought in the US that is against the idea of free trade, with China bearing the brunt of a lot of negative commentsn.“But I hope the US will resist the populist idea that the best way to ignite [national] growth is to construct walls around local economies through protectionist measures, the aims of which are to restrict trade.”He said such moves – which could include imposing high tariffs and other import barriers to restrict sales in the US of goods made in China and other countries – were part of “discredited” policies that would only damage growth in the long run.Some politicians and industrialists in the US have called for tariff barriers as a way to stimulate the US economy, which is still struggling to move into a higher phase of growth after the recession.In 2011, according to projections from the IHS Global Insight economics consultancy, the US is likely to lose to China the position it has held over more than 100 years as the world’s biggest manufacturing nation by output.Asked about negative comments on China earlier in the year by Jeff Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, Mr Cutler said he did not share the view that the mood in China was turning against foreign businesses.“There are some political pressures inside China to favour local companies when awarding [government] contracts but this is not the same as saying that the climate is acting to discourage companies based outside China,” Mr Cutler said.He also side-stepped the question of whether China had indulged in “currency manipulation” by giving its exporters an artificial boost through keeping the renminbi low. The topic is another controversial issue in the US, with a number of commentators pressing for the US government to step up action to force a revaluation. “I don’t have the [economic] competence to give a view as to whether the renminbi is fairly valued.”But he added that swings in currencies were a problem for most international manufacturers, and that they had to cope as best they could. One way to do this, he said, was to open up local centres of production so that demand for goods in specific countries could be matched as much as possible by products made in the same location, as a result reducing currency risks.Eaton produces a range of products and services, from fuel-efficient systems to management tools and aircraft components, and is likely this year to have sales in China of about $1bn, making the country one of its largest markets.Mr Cutler said China’s political rulers deserved praise for “the fine job” they had made of “fine-tuning” the economy by pushing up growth without sparking inflation.
38;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-10-24T17:20:07Z;Overseas demand lifts US manufacturers;;The US economy may be faltering, but many big names in American manufacturing are going from strength to strength.In the past week, a succession of industrial companies, including Boeing, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Eaton, reported good third-quarter results and gave upbeat views on their prospects. Over the next two weeks, others, including Emerson Electric, 3M and Cummins are expected to show similar evidence of robust health.Yet in recent weeks, concerns over the strength of the recovery have been gathering force. Official data showed US industrial production fell in September, for the first time in more than a year. The discrepancy raises the question of whether US companies have been able to see sources of strength that macroeconomic data have missed, or have failed to appreciate the slowdown about to hit them.Honeywell, which makes industrial equipment and aircraft components, predicted on Friday that profits in its operating businesses would rise by 10 per cent or more next year.However, David Anderson, the chief financial officer, sounded a note of caution. “The markets we are in are generally in pretty good shape. But many of the macroeconomic indicators, particularly outside the industrial economy, are mixed to soft,” he said. “You have got to say, ‘How long will it continue?’ ”One reason for the disconnect is that markets outside the US are much stronger. The outperformance of the industrial sector this year compared with the broad S&P 500 index has reflected the health of overseas markets rather than that of the US economy.A common theme in all of last week’s good results was the strength of demand in China, other emerging Asian economies, the Middle East and Latin America.Most large industrial companies say they want to produce as much as possible in the markets they serve, but exports from the US are also rising, in a move towards the rebalancing of the world economy that is sought by many policymakers.About 25 per cent of US manufacturing output is exported, and David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, calculates that the dollar is about 10 per cent undervalued relative to its long-term average, giving US exporters an advantage. But the strength of exports may not be enough to sustain flagging growth.Eric Landry, who covers the industrial sector for Morningstar, the investment research company, warned: “Some of the forward-looking indicators can sometimes do better at predicting the outlook for companies than comments made by the companies themselves.”
39;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Emerging markets drive Caterpillar;;Global demand for construction equipment is growing faster than previously expected by US manufacturers amid strong growth in Latin America and the return of demand in North America.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, reported that profits nearly doubled in the third quarter from last year, driven by emerging markets.Sales revenues in Latin America rose 95 per cent, growing much faster than the Asia-Pacific region, where sales increased 51 per cent and Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where sales rose 31 per cent.Caterpillar signalled that demand had also started to return in North America, with sales revenues in the third quarter up 55 per cent.However, Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations, stressed that demand was coming off a low base, after a situation in which sales dropped nearly 80 per cent between their peak in 2006 and late 2009.“Today we’re seeing improvement from those low levels as customers are buying some machines to slow the ageing of their fleets,” he said. “In addition, dealers have increased machine purchases for rental fleets.”CNH Global, another large US manufacturer of construction and farm equipment owned by Fiat, said sales of construction machinery rose by 85 per cent in Latin America in the third quarter, ahead of 54 per cent in other emerging markets, North America at 34 per cent and western Europe at 27 per cent.The strength of demand in Latin America prompted CNH to raise its forecast for growth in global construction-machinery markets to 40-45 per cent this year, up from its previous forecast of 15-20 per cent.Big industrial companies such as Boeing, United Technologies and Eaton have generally struck a bullish note this earnings season, shrugging off concerns that the global economy could stall.Caterpillar made a net profit in the third quarter of $792m, or $1.22 per share, up from $404m, or 64 cents per share, for the same period last year and above Wall Street’s average expectations of $1.09 per share.Revenue was $11.1bn, up from $7.2bn a year ago and ahead of a consensus forecast of about $10.48bn. The company raised its outlook for 2010 to $3.80-$4.00 per share, up from its previous guidance of $3.15-$3.85. It said revenue would be $41bn-$42bn, up on its previous guidance of $39-$42bn, while it expected sales to top $50bn in 2011.CNH made net income of $102m, or 43 cents per share, excluding one-off items, compared with a loss of $22m, or 9 cents a share, last year. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 34 cents per share.Caterpillar shares were down 1.70 per cent at $78.52, while CNH was up 2.38 per cent at $42.55 by mid-afternoon in New York.
40;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-10-20T19:20:08Z;Boeing rejects recession fears;;US manufacturers have rejected fears of a global slide into recession with a series of strong results and positive statements, showing the benefit of strong growth in emerging economies in Asia and the Middle East.Aerospace and capitals goods companies reporting third-quarter earnings, including Boeing and United Technologies, forecast that full-year profits would be at the top end of previous forecast ranges or higher.Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by sales, raised its forecast for the year by about 5 per cent, on strong demand for commercial aircraft.“Both passenger and freighter markets [are] rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated,” said Jim McNerney, chief executive.He said the growth was fuelled by increasing air travel globally, but he stressed that emerging markets continued to show the strongest recovery.Net income in the quarter was $837m, or $1.12 per share, against a loss last time and beating analysts’ average expectation of $1.05.Boeing booked 257 orders in the quarter with just 36 cancellations, compared with its net order book addition of 79 aircraft previously.Its contract backlog stands at 3,401 aircraft, valued at $255bn.Mr McNerney said in a statement that the orders reflected “improved overall market confidence”.United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney aero engines and Sikorsky helicopters, also reported rising orders, and said it expected earnings per share of $4.70 for the full year, at the top of its previous forecast range, even though its sales projection was unchanged.Third-quarter earnings were $1.30, up 14 per cent, and again ahead of analysts’ forecasts.The company said year-to-date equipment orders in China were up more than 15 per cent, excluding currency effects.Eaton, the industrial equipment and components manufacturer, raised its forecast of full-year earnings by 10 per cent, thanks to better-than-expected second-half growth and looked forward to stronger markets for all its businesses in 2011.Sandy Cutler, chief executive, said emerging economies, where Eaton makes about 25 per cent of its sales, were particularly healthy, but US sales were also up 8 per cent year on year.“Among investors there have been concerns that things are starting to cool off and we won’t see earnings momentum going into next year. But we are seeing abnormally strong activity for the time of year.”Textron, the manufacturer of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, made a loss of $0.17 per share in the quarter, because of a write-off linked to its Canadian finance unit, but it raised its forecast for underlying earnings from continuing operations.
41;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-10-10T16:50:26Z;US industrial groups target emerging markets;;Industrial groups have shown the strongest gains in earnings expectations of any US sector as followers bet that strong emerging market growth will counter the impact of a weak domestic economy.The third-quarter earnings season is about to get fully under way with a range of companies due to present updates in the coming weeks. The reports are set to provide further evidence of US companies’ dependence on foreign markets for growth.Expectations for overall earnings growth have slowed since July as hopes for growth in the financial sector have faded. But forecasts have accelerated for industrial and technology groups, with the common factor being their higher-than-average exposure to non-US markets.Analysts expect companies with more than 50 per cent of revenues coming from overseas to increase sales by an average of 10 per cent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters, compared with 4 per cent growth for companies with mostly domestic revenue.“We think that geographic footprints will have a tremendous impact as we expect industrial companies to report much stronger results in emerging markets,” said Sam Stovall of Standard & Poor’s, who identified the strongest markets as China, India and Latin America.General Electric, which reports on Friday, is a good example. It has become increasingly international during the recession as it rebalances towards industry and away from financial services.Between 2007 and 2009, GE’s annual revenues fell by 16 per cent in the US to $72.5bn but in the rest of the world dropped only 2 per cent to $84.3bn.Announcing a $700m power station deal in Saudi Arabia last week, Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE’s power and water business, contrasted the slow recovery in the US and Europe with the dynamism of emerging economies that have a rapidly rising need for energy.“In countries such as China, India and Saudi Arabia, we are seeing very strong growth at the moment,” he said. “That is being reflected in some big projects going ahead.”The International Monetary Fund has forecast that China’s economy will grow by 10.5 per cent this year, India’s by 9.7 per cent, and the Middle East and north Africa by 4.1 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent for the US.GE has pursued a series of bolt-on deals to tap those faster-growing markets. Last week, it announced a $3bn deal to buy Dresser of the US, and confirmed it had a $1.2bn offer rejected by the UK’s Wellstream. The two target companies both serve the global energy industry.Expectations for US growth this year have been waning. Car manufacturers, for example, began the year thinking the US market might reach 12.5m vehicles this year, up from 10.4m last year. It now looks likely to be less than 12m.In many emerging economies, however, forecasts have been revised up. Alcoa, which was the first US group to report for the third quarter, said last week it had raised its estimate of growth in aluminium demand this year from 10 per cent last December to 13 per cent now.Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa’s chief executive, said: “In countries such as China, Brazil, India and Russia, more and more people are moving into the middle class, driving demand in building and construction, transportation and packaging.”The strength of emerging markets is expected to drive US industrial companies’ strategy.“You don’t need to hire in the US and you don’t need to invest in the US. That’s the challenge the Fed has in trying to stimulate growth,” said Karl Mills, a portfolio manager at Jurika, Mills & Keifer.“If you’re running John Deere or Caterpillar, or Boeing or Apple, where do you want to put your next team of engineers?”For some companies, the answer is clear. Eaton, an Ohio-based manufacturing company that makes hydraulic components for trucks and power control systems for data centres, is planning further expansion in emerging economies to keep up with new orders.“In China we are expanding several facilities because we are simply out of capacity,” said Rick Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, which reports on October 20.“We are the world’s largest producer of valves for car engines. Temporarily we shipped in from elsewhere but you can’t do that long term.”He expects rapid growth there to continue. “If you take an economy the size of China and grow industrial production 12 per cent, that is an awful lot of equipment that has to be put in place.”It saw rapid growth during the first half of 2010 as customers finally replaced worn-out equipment but expects its growth rate to slow in the second half as the impact of stimulus spending and the inventory cycle ease.
42;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-09-14T22:30:10Z;Eaton looks for ‘Plan B’ on derivatives;;Eaton Corp, the US manufacturer, is exploring ways to bypass proposed legislation on derivatives that some industrial companies fear may spell trouble for their operations.The planning underscores the level of concern among leading manufacturers over the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in July, which included provisions to bring closer scrutiny to the murky world of derivatives.As a result of the legislation, companies defined as “major swaps participants” are likely to face higher capital and margin requirements for their derivatives trades.Manufacturers which use the instruments to reduce currency, commodity and interest rate risks were promised exemptions but this will remain unclear until the specific rules are produced by regulators.At the end of 2009 Eaton had about $879m of notional hedging exposure as part of contracts to smooth interest rates, reduce currency volatility, and lock in the costs of raw materials such as iron and plastic between the time it receives an order and the time it delivers – often months later.Richard Fearon, Eaton’s chief financial and planning officer, told the Financial Times his company needed a “Plan-B” in case regulators threw a wide net around derivatives, capturing indu­s­trial companies as well as financial speculators.Options being considered by the maker of power equipment include using providers of derivatives contracts that are based outside the US “so that you don’t have those restrictions”, Mr Fearon said.In Europe, for example, industrial companies have recently gained some crucial exemptions in derivatives legislation being drafted by the European Commission due to sustained lobbying.Alternatively, Mr Fearon said that Eaton and other manufacturing companies could secure long-term fixed-price contracts with raw material suppliers – in effect including a hedge into deals to purchase commodities.Manufacturers have been vocal with their concerns about the proposed rule changes.The NAM, a lobby group whose members include companies such as Caterpillar and General Electric, is pressing the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek a narrow authority.SEC and CFTC officials have requested public comments by mid September.
43;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-08-24T23:00:44Z;US businesses alarmed at SEC plan;;Corporate America senses a revolution in the offing on Wednesday – and one it finds deeply alarming.“The implications of [Wednesday’s] decision will be far-reaching and likely will have a major impact on how all US publicly traded companies are governed,” the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the biggest US companies, said in a letter last week to the White House. It warned of “a major threat to the ability of US companies to grow and create jobs”.Ten senators, led by Richard Shelby, senior Republican on the Senate banking committee, urged the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be “particularly careful” to ensure that Wednesday’s planned change did not impose unnecessary requirements on companies “at a time when capital formation and job creation are in jeopardy”.The source of the business and Republican concern is a corporate governance change, expected to be approved by the SEC on Wednesday, allowing large shareholders to nominate their own broad candidates directly, rather than going through the expensive and time consuming process of a proxy fight.This increase in shareholder power is designed to make it easier to hold underperforming boards to account, bringing in fresh directors to challenge corporate strategies on issues ranging from pay to safety.But industry opposition to the “proxy access” rule is fierce. Business groups may still seek to bring a legal challenge to any rule approved on Wednesday. Their concern centres on fears that the new investor right will be hijacked by unions and other special interest groups to force boards to accede on particular issues. The Business Roundtable asserted that the threat of a director election contest could “place unnecessary pressure on a company to improve short-term financial performance” at the expense of long-term growth.The new shareholder power would also increase the influence of hedge funds, which “may use proxy access to advance their own short-term interests”, said the Business Roundtable letter, signed by Alexander Cutler, chairman and chief executive of Eaton Corporation, and Ivan Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications.Investors on Tuesday rejected these assertions. Kurt Schacht of the CFA Institute, which represents investment professionals, dismissed the industry warnings as “complete and utter camouflage”. Mr Schacht, who sits on the SEC’s investor advisory committee, said it was “insulting” to shareholders to suggest that they would not be able to recognise if a fellow investor, such as a hedge fund, was trying to misuse the new power.The argument is a long-running one – proxy access has been under consideration by the SEC since 2003. The polarized nature of the debate reflects an ideological divide on the purpose of governance regulation.“This is 80 per cent political … it’s all about a long-term labor agenda to change the nature of corporate America that worries a lot of people,” said Chuck Nathan, a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins. “They don’t think this is just about corporate governance – they see ulterior motives.”All sides to the debate agree the change is potentially revolutionary but stress it is too soon to judge the extent to which disgruntled shareholders will use their new legal power.“The question is going to be what happens after a couple of people get on the ballot and are not elected,” said Jay Eisenhofer of law firm Grant & Eisenhofer, which represents institutional investors taking legal action. “People should not forget the extent of shareholder apathy – the big story of the last proxy season has been how few fights there have been.”

The S&P 500 had fallen 1.4 per cent in early trading. Six of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 remained down.Before the decision, the markets fell as investors were concerned that the Fed might follow the Bank of Japan and keep monetary policy unchanged.The US indices had risen on Monday on hopes that the Fed might introduce further quantitative easing.The Fed left benchmark overnight interest rates steady in a zero to 0.25 per cent range, as expected.Markets were also concerned by a report that showed an unexpected decline in US non-farm productivity, the first decline since the end of 2008, with companies finding it harder to keep cutting costs even though labour costs barely edged up.Weaker-than-expected import data from China also weighed on sentiment, pushing materials stocks down. The S&P 500 materials sector suffered the sharpest fall in the index, dropping 1 per cent.Both Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s second-biggest copper producer, and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, fell after the Chinese data softened metal prices.Alcoa dropped 2.7 per cent to $11.35, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 2 per cent to $73.21 and Cliffs Natural Resources sank 2 per cent to $61.23.Oil prices also fell after the news from China with knock-on effects for producers: ExxonMobil fell 0.8 per cent to $61.93, Conoco Phillips lost 0.8 per cent to $56.87 and Chevron slipped 0.3 per cent to $79.04.Nuance Communications, the speech recognition technology supplier, missed analysts’ estimates with third-quarter sales of $273.2m coming in below a consensus forecast of $301m even though profits beat expectations. The shares slid 10.9 per cent to $15.47.In earnings news, shares of MBIA soared 4.5 per cent to $9.60 after it posted a 45 per cent jump in earnings in the second quarter because of a change in the value of derivatives contracts. Net income rose to $6.32 a share for the quarter compared with $4.30 for the same period last year.Software manufacturer Novell sank 3.2 per cent to $5.82 after it cut its third- quarter revenue outlook.Best Buy, the electricals retailer, dropped 2.8 per cent to $34.57 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating from “buy” to “neutral”.
45;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Corporate earnings: Revival of the fittest;Large companies reap benefits of cost cuts, but the results may be fleeting;"“I feel great,” says Feike Sijbesma. Just a few months ago, these were not words one would have expected to hear from a European industrial chief. Companies at the start of the year were expecting a difficult 2010 with slow growth, austerity measures and debt problems likely to dominate.Instead, many big companies on both sides of the Atlantic have come out of the recession in a better position than that in which they entered it. “It is funny to see: I would not have predicted this at all in the last quarter of 2008. We are stronger than we were before the crisis – our balance sheet is much stronger, our operational performance is our best ever, our debt is down by two-thirds,” says Mr Sijbesma, who heads DSM, the Dutch chemicals and life sciences group.That optimism is shared in boardrooms across Europe and the US. In a buoyant second-quarter results season, two-thirds of European groups beat analyst forecasts; predictions suggest that leading American companies will report record profits this year. Businesses are flush with cash as they reap the benefits of rigorous cost-cutting and borrowing rates at historic lows.Even the most bullish executives privately acknowledge that there are risks to the recovery as some of the reasons underlying it evaporate and concerns persist over how developed countries tackle their public debt. But for now many of them are basking in a remarkable corporate renaissance in which size is a factor. “The strong are getting stronger and the weak are getting weaker. The competitive advantage has gone to the bigger companies,” says the chief executive of one group with $100bn revenues.How could a corporate sector that experienced the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s recover so quickly even though consumers, governments and many banks are still suffering the hangover of the pre-crisis debt binge? Inhabitants of America’s and Europe’s executive offices point to the regenerative powers of a turmoil that, according to Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, was more of a radical “reset” than a normal cyclical crisis.The sudden nature of the crisis in late 2008 caused companies to tighten their belts quickly and drastically, cutting jobs and costs while conserving cash. “What helped us was how severe the crisis was: it didn’t start gently but very rudely,” says Mr Sijbesma, whose initial cost-cutting target of €100m ($132m, £83m) a year out of €8bn revenues was quickly exceeded by €100m. DSM’s net debt has fallen from €1.8bn to €600m.Plenty of businesses making similar adjustments worldwide found themselves in a position to take advantage of their lean cost structures and healthy finances as confidence in the global economy picked up this year. “We have benefited from the release of pent-up demand. Companies cannot postpone those spending decisions forever,” says Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, the industrial group that last month beat Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results.Groups have also registered soaring sales as their customers replenished their inventory levels. But by its nature that restocking has to end soon.A more important driver of profitability has been the ability of American and European companies to eke out handsome increases in earnings even where top-line revenues were not growing as fast as before the downturn, or were in some cases even falling.The phenomenon – known as operating leverage – is typical of a post-crisis period and results from sharp cost-cutting. As companies become leaner, a higher proportion of revenue drops to the bottom line. That means results such as Eaton’s are possible: profits rose more than sevenfold even though revenues increased by only 16 per cent. At GE, earnings per share were up 15 per cent although its revenues fell.Many market-watchers have started to talk about an “earnings-driven recovery”, a virtuous circle where strong profits lead to higher employment levels and boost consumption, staving off the much-feared double-dip recession. “Robust corporate earnings have been associated with strong economic performance in the early stages of previous US recoveries,” wrote John Richards, a Royal Bank of Scotland strategist, in a recent note.Net profit margins for the leading US companies that make up the Standard and Poor’s 500 index are forecast this year to be almost in line with the peak of 2006, while total earnings will surpass 2007’s high of $743bn, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analysts. That combined with minimal capital expenditure and lower costs has led to cash piles expanding rapidly. US non-financial companies had $1,800bn in cash and other liquid assets on their balance sheets at the end of March, according to the US Federal Reserve. That is equivalent to 7 per cent of all corporate assets, the highest percentage in half a century.The optimists see this as a sign that a wave of corporate spending, including on takeovers, is about to be unleashed. “This trend bodes well for the future,” says Mr Richards of RBS. “As uncertainty subsides, this cash can be redeployed for more productive ends. Look not only for additional debt reduction but …an increase in capital expenditure, a restocking of inventories and eventually an increase in hiring.”But pessimists see companies afraid of the future, hoarding cash because of the uncertain economic outlook and only warily undertaking mergers or acquisitions. The plans of many groups reflect the contradiction. DSM’s Mr Sijbesma says: “We will put cash into M&A and growth. But we need to continue with our focus on cash management. Prudence, doing things step by step and not feeling pressured are important parts of this.”In the US, share buy-backs – where a company purchases its own stock to increase earnings per share – are starting again, as are dividend increases. “It is an admission of defeat,” says a senior corporate financier. “It is as if companies’ managements are saying they do not know how to generate growth and would rather shift the responsibility to investors.”Many chief executives see things differently, however, with the head of the $100bn group saying: “Companies have realised that a solid and conservative balance sheet is an asset.” A large number are further buttressing their financial standing by taking advantage of the exceptionally low interest rates on offer in capital markets. IBM recently issued a three-year bond at a record low rate of 1 per cent.This is another example of a two-tier system emerging. The corporate treasurer of a UK company with £6bn revenues says: “It has stayed a story of the haves and the have-nots throughout the past two years. The markets have periodically closed or become very expensive for the have-nots. But for the haves, these are the lowest corporate bond rates in history.”David Rhodes, head of Boston Consulting Group’s financial institutions practice, says the consultancy’s surveys show “the companies that are market leaders or the biggest companies were much more confident than smaller companies and were better at holding market share and planning more aggressive moves”.Even among the strong, some sceptical investors and executives argue, there is less than meets the eye to the corporate renewal. They point to the fact that the cost-cutting is unlikely to be repeated and will have a smaller impact on profits as time goes on. “You cannot conjure profits out of thin air. Without increases in revenues, it is difficult to have sustainable profit growth,” says a former executive at a large US group.Investors are increasingly focused on future profitability – and for that they need to see growth in sales. When GE reported last month, it emphasised its first increase in earnings per share since late 2007. Markets nonetheless sent the shares down 4.5 per cent on the day, choosing to focus on the group’s 4 per cent fall in revenues.Karen Olney, equity strategist at UBS in London, is forecasting a 25-30 per cent rise in profitability at European companies this year, much of which has already been achieved. Next year, she thinks, it will be more like 10 per cent: “The issue everyone is looking at is 2011. Stronger earnings growth for 2010 may mean a weaker 2011.”Added to that is an expected weakening of US and European economies in the second half of this year. Companies talk up their prospects in emerging markets instead, especially China. American aircraft-maker Boeing notes that it has more orders from China than the US in its backlog. Groups such as Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and French carmaker Renault will soon make half of their sales from these faster-growing countries.Much of the earnings growth in the US and Europe has come from sectors such as industrials; consumer discretionary, including electronics (driven by sales of Apple’s iPad); and materials such as natural resources that are exposed to emerging markets; or from those that have benefited from renewed investment, such as information technology. US-focused sectors such as telecommunications, utilities and healthcare remain in the doldrums, held back by weak domestic growth.But some are unconvinced by the ability of the rapidly growing Bric economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China to save western companies. Mr Rhodes notes that developed countries account for 70 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product against 18 per cent for developing Asia. “Seventy per cent can’t live off the growth of 18 per cent,” he adds. Concern about a slowdown in China is mounting, although most managers brush that aside, stressing that the vast country’s growth will still far outpace that of the west.Among many executives, the bigger worry is about how western countries go about reducing their debt. Mr Sijbesma at DSM sees no sign of the recovery petering out. But he adds: “Governments are not in a good shape. The uncertainty hanging over markets is: how will governments solve their problems? They can do it in a way that hurts growth.”The head of the $100bn group says: “I don’t see a slowdown. But there is enough uncertainty that I’m always cautious. Who would have thought a few months ago that we would have a debate about ‘Could the euro fall apart?’. We have a way to go yet.”"
46;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-08-02T14:29:00Z;US factory output slows in July;;Growth in the the US manufacturing sector slowed in July for the third month running, adding to evidence that the economic recovery is cooling.The Institute of Supply Management said on Monday that its index of factory activity had fallen to 55.5 in July from 56.2 in June. It was the 12th consecutive month that manufacturing expanded, but was the lowest reading since last December.New orders and production stalled in July, while employment and rising inventories supported the sector. Although more than half of the 18 industries tracked by ISM reported factory expansion, executives complained that a slow economy had “killed” orders for new machinery and that retailers were “unwilling to gamble on inventory”.The data comes as economists debate the prospect of a double-dip recession, following last Friday’s government report showing economic growth slowing to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent. Those figures offered a mixed picture for manufacturing, with a surge of foreign imports denting output but business demand remaining strong.In spite of signs of a slowdown, last month several US manufacturers signalled continued confidence, with manufacturers such as United Technologies, Textron and Eaton raising their profit forecasts.Gregory Hayes, chief financial officer at United Technologies, which produces air conditioners and elevators, said he saw “signs that the worst is behind us” thanks to a rise in revenues and new orders.Drew Industries, which makes recreational vehicles, said on Monday that output usually slowed in July because of plants shutting down for a week, but that generally the manufacturer had been “delighted” by the strong demand for trailers and RVs compared with last year.US manufacturing activity in July appeared to outpace China’s factory sector, in which expansion slowed to its lowest level since February 2009 as the government curbed lending.A separate report released on Monday by KPMG showed that optimism among Chinese manufacturers had sunk to its lowest point since January 2009. Meanwhile, US manufacturers are feeling more hopeful that cash-hoarding companies will ramp up new orders.
47;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx raises earnings outlook;;FedEx became the latest big US company to raise its full-year earnings guidance on Monday, adding to evidence that the country’s industry is steering its way through an uneven global recovery.In spite of fears of a double-dip recession, concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and slowing industrial production in Asia, several big companies have reported second-quarter earnings that were better than expected. Of 176 S&P 500 companies reporting this quarter, 125 beat Wall Street estimates, 18 missed expectations and 33 were within 2 per cent of forecasts.A handful of industrial companies such as Caterpillar and Eaton Corp have upgraded their outlook for the full year.General Electric partially restored its dividend last week after slashing it in 2009. Analysts said the moves indicated that US corporations were picking their way through the difficult environment, tapping growth in regions and markets that were recovering and benefiting from tight cost controls elsewhere.“Anything touching automotives, trucks, construction equipment and semiconductors has just been white hot,” said Nigel Coe, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, though defence and commercial construction markets had been slower to recover.He noted that in the industrial arena companies had raised revenue forecasts by 4 per cent for the second half of the year and increased the midpoint of profit estimates. “That suggests that the worst-case scenarios are now off the table,” he said.FedEx expects volumes at its International Priority unit – which handles express deliveries – to grow more than 20 per cent this quarter, helping it achieve full-year earnings per share of $4.60-$5.20, up from previous guidance of $4.40-$5.00 per share. FedEx shares were up 5.6 per cent at the close of trading.“Our revenue and earnings growth are exceeding original expectations, primarily due to better-than-anticipated growth in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground volumes,” said Alan Graf Jr, chief financial officer.In June, Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, dismissed what he called “an undue sense of pessimism”.FedEx’s forecast is based on stable oil prices and a “moderate recovery in the global economy”.
48;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-07-22T21:17:44Z;Industrial groups defy gloom with strong orders;Bullish calls and sound profits from both Caterpillar and 3M;Two of the US’s biggest industrial companies on Thursday brushed aside concerns about a further global economic slowdown as they raised forecasts for full-year profits and said their order books were strengthening.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, and 3M, which manufactures a wide range of products from sticky tape to traffic signs, both issued the bullish calls while reporting second-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.The results and improved outlooks pushed up the companies’ share prices, in turn helping to lift the broader market in New York. Caterpillar and 3M are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Worries over weak private sector job creation, uncertain equity markets and a moribund construction industry have prompted many observers to take an increasingly gloomy view of the US’s economic recovery.With Europe’s financial woes and signs of slowing growth in China, many are concerned at the prospect of a double-dip recession.However, the US industrial sector is striking a quite different tone. The results from Caterpillar and 3M came a day after United Technologies, Eaton Corp and Textron issued results well ahead of analysts’ expectations.“While there are significant economic concerns around the world that we are watching closely, orders have continued to outpace our shipments, and we expect to increase production in the second half of the year,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive.Caterpillar made a net profit in the quarter of $707m or $1.09 per share, up from $371m or 60 cents a share in the same period last year and beating analysts’ consensus forecast of about 85 cents per share.Caterpillar’s revenues in the second quarter were $10.4bn, up from $8bn last year and above expectations of about $9.8bn.The company increased its outlook for the full year, saying it expected 2010 profits of $3.15-$3.85 per share on revenues of $39bn-$42bn, up from its prior forecast of $2.50-$3.25 per share and revenues of $38bn-$42bn.Meanwhile, 3M made a net profit of $1.12bn or $1.54 per share in the second quarter, up from $783m or $1.12 per share last year and ahead of analysts’ expectations of $1.48 per share. Revenues rose to $6.7bn from $5.7bn a year earlier.The company expects full-year earnings of $5.65-$5.80 per share, up from its prior projection of $5.40-$5.60.“There will possibly be a period of slower growth in end markets later this year,” said George Buckley, chief executive of 3M. “This isn’t a “double-dip” per se. It’s just a soft spot – very normal as economic growth takes a breather for a while.”
49;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-07-22T02:04:22Z;US manufacturers bullish on earnings;;A clutch of US industrial companies on Wednesday boosted their earnings outlook for the year and reported increased quarterly revenues, suggesting a vein of underlying strength to the manufacturing economy.In past months, weak jobs numbers from the US, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and indications that industrial production in Asia is beginning to slow have all weighed on international equity markets.But second-quarter earnings have offered some more positive indicators.United Technologies, Eaton Corp and Textron – which make a wide range of goods from aircraft engines to E-Z-Go golf carts – handily beat the benchmarks set by analysts.Textron closed up 8.7 per cent to $19.65, Eaton rose 5.9 per cent to $73.14 and UTC was down 0.8 per cent to $67.03.Since 2008, companies have focused on slashing costs to cope with tumbling demand. That helped them to sustain margins and profits, but investors have been waiting for signs of sales growth that would indicate the next phase in the fitful economic recovery.At UTC second-quarter organic revenues rose for the first time in over a year and total revenues climbed 5 per cent to $13.9bn. Orders also improved at units like Otis, the elevator company, which tend to recover later in the economic cycle.Net profit and earnings per share were both up 14 per cent on the same period in 2009, at $1.1bn and $1.20 respectively.“UTC’s results this quarter reflect strong execution in an improved end market environment,” said Louis Chênevert, UTC’s chief executive. “The return of revenue growth, combined with our cost reduction actions, led to solid earnings growth.”Meanwhile, Eaton said sales grew 16 per cent to $3.4bn in the quarter and were 9 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 2010 “reflecting the continued expansion in our markets around the world”. Net profit climbed to $226m compared to $29m in 2009, giving earnings per share of $1.33 compared to 17 cents.“As we survey our end markets, the year is shaping up to be better than we had forecast in April,” said Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive. “We now anticipate our overall end markets will grow by 8 per cent versus our earlier forecast of 6 per cent.Still, Mr Cutler cautioned that “you are going to see fairly different growth rates for companies depending on what their mix of businesses is…Those that have a significant portfolio of late cycle businesses probably won’t recover entirely till 2011.”And cost cutting remains the key driver of profitability. UTC now expects earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.70 in 2010, up from earlier forecasts of $4.50 to $4.65 thanks to careful cost controls.Textron raised its full year earnings per share forecasts to 55-65 cents, from 30-50 cents. It also increased its sales estimate to $10.9bn for the full year, up from $10.5bn.For the quarter, Textron made a net profit of $82m compared with a $58m loss last year, giving earnings per share of $0.27 compared to a 23 cents loss. Revenues in the quarter rose 3.7 per cent to $2.7bn.Executives struck other notes of caution. Scott Donnelly, Textron’s chief executive, said the company was reviewing its outlook for sales of certain business jets in the light of the dip in business confidence in Europe.And UTC said that currency weakness in Europe could create an 8 cents per share translation headwind for the full year and reduced its revenue guidance to about $54bn.Also, Mr Cutler noted that “the rate of economic growth in China has moderated slightly” but added that the company still anticipates “solid global growth continuing during the second half of the year.”To demonstrate its confidence the company raised its guidance for the full year and also increased its quarterly dividend by 16 per cent to $0.58 per share.

The two additional sources said financial sponsors would be interested in the Danaher division, speculating that private equity suitors may be contacted if the process widens.The second source said Pacific Scientific has EBITDA of approximately USD 130m, adding that the business could command a multiple in the ballpark of 8x EBITDA. This source characterized Pacific Scientific as a “hodge podge” of different businesses including aerospace and defense assets as well as fire safety equipment.Potential buyers for Pacific Scientific could include actuation companies such as Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Moog (NYSE:MOG.A), Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) and Woodward Governor (NASDAQ:WGOV), said the third source.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"
51;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-06-13T21:17:19Z;Wider pick of the jobs crop;;"Jason Hild, who graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business yesterday, does not yet have a job lined up, but he is not the least bit nervous.Mr Hild, whose background is in private equity, has already turned down four offers and now evaluates potential jobs based on a personal list of nine criteria, ranging from geography (he wants to be in the San Francisco Bay area) to duties (he wants profit and loss responsibilities) to job description (he wants to work at the intersection of finance and operations).“I’ve gotten more picky,” says the 31-year-old. “I want a job congruent with what I’ve worked so hard for in business school. My biggest fear is taking something where I am compromising myself, or settling.”Mr Hild’s experience is not unusual. Even as the US unemployment rate hovers at 10 per cent and signs of a full-fledged economic recovery remain elusive, the job market for newly minted MBAs is strengthening. Companies in sectors from retail to real estate, from private equity to healthcare are increasing their ‘just in time’ recruitment activity and some fresh business school talent once again has the luxury of conducting a more discriminating job search.Last year was perhaps the worst in recent history for MBA recruiting. As the global financial system unravelled and banks fought for survival, many companies slashed MBA hiring and even business school stars had a tough time finding a job. But while the brutality of that job market lingers in the minds of many career services officers, most are hopeful about how this year’s numbers will shake out.Last year, 80 per cent of students at New York University Stern had secured a job within three months of graduation; the school has yet to formally tabulate its employment statistics for this year’s class, but Pamela Mittman, assistant dean of career services, says that Stern’s numbers will this year be above that figure. “I am cautiously optimistic,” she says.Only 51 per cent of MBAs at UCLA Anderson School of Management had lined up jobs at graduation time last year, but according to Rob Weiler, director of the career services centre, the number will be “significantly ahead” of last year and probably much closer to its usual placement figure of 85 per cent.“There’s been a flurry of activity in the past few weeks, a lot of ‘just in time’ hiring,” says Mr Weiler, referring to the phenomenon of companies extending offers to meet sudden manpower demands. “The students have learned to expect the worst after all they’ve gone through, but from what I’ve seen most are ploughing ahead and are optimistic that they will get what they want. There’s not a ton of people settling.”According to surveys conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council in mid-February to mid-March, 55 per cent of companies said they planned to hire business school graduates, 5 per cent more than last year. And it has been even busier in April and May, say recruiters.“In the past three months we’ve started actively recruiting MBAs,” says Casey Rasata, university relations manager at Eaton, the global power management company. “Business is back significantly for several of our markets and regions around the world and we find ourselves with many open positions. Like a lot of companies, we were conservative in the fall and into January and February, but we now have jobs that we would like to fill.”This year, Eaton plans to hire 15 MBAs and 10 summer interns to its leadership development programme. Last year, Eaton hired only one full time employee and just four interns.When the academic year began in September, the job picture did not look as good. The fall recruiting season was grim: according to a survey by the MBA Career Services Council, the umbrella group for business school career placement officers,
79 per cent of schools reported a decline in on-campus recruiting. Many officials fretted that with so many people from the class of ’09 still unemployed, the class of ’10 would have an even harder time finding work.That has not happened, however. “We don’t have any signals that people from ’09 are still on the market or competing with this year’s graduates,” says Pulin Sanghvi, the director of the career management center at Stanford GSB.Mr Sanghvi classifies the dismal autumn recruiting season as a lagging indicator, because companies’ decisions about when, where and how much to recruit were made in the summer and spring of ’09, during the throes of the economic crisis.But real-time indicators, such as the number of just-in-time job listings – which are by definition very different from companies recruiting MBAs in October for jobs starting the following year – are up substantially. At Stanford GSB, second-year job postings are up 67 per cent from last year and job postings for alumni are up 35 per cent. These postings are from hedge funds, investment management companies, as well as clean tech companies, healthcare and social media companies, according to Mr Sanghvi.“We have had a sharp recovery in the past six to nine months in many sectors and there’s no question that what we’re seeing is a marked improvement in the job market,” he says. “There’s been a complete shift in student mentality; there was concern, fear and risk aversion last year. But now students are even turning down job offers and working to get something that’s more aligned with their interests and career goals.”However, in spite of these encouraging signs, the return of the MBA job market is not a sure thing, according to Gina Resnick, assistant dean for career services at Columbia University Business School. “I think we’d all like to think we could breathe a sigh of relief, but that would be foolish,” she says. “Things can change on a dime and we can’t take anything for granted.”As for Mr Hild, the new GSB grad, he plans to extend the lease on his flat in Palo Alto and keep networking until the right job opportunity comes along. He is confident it will. “I’m optimistic enough to be discerning, but cautious enough to know I have to work harder to get a job,” he says. “I need to nail my interviews, follow up on every lead and be more diligent about sending thank you notes.”"

Frequently it is the government customer that is sensitive about revealing details.One of the few publicly audited ones is a 2004 agreement between the Czech Republic and Sweden to lease 14 Gripen fighter jets.An earlier agreement, in 2001, to sell jets to the Czech Republic by BAE Systems and Saab of Sweden, which was later cancelled, became the subject of a UK’s Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribery. The SFO has since concluded its investigation after reaching a settlement with BAE earlier this year.The 2004 agreement is slated to run for 10 years with an offset obligation of CZK25.5bn ($1.19bn), which represents 130 per cent of the value of the lease payments for the Gripen aircraft. This means that the Gripen team has to actively assist in the generation of exports of Czech goods to that value.The programme is audited every year by the Czech government and at the end of 2008 it had reached a cumulative value of CZK16.24bn – so more than 63 per cent of the total offset obligation.The programme is a mix of direct offset – meaning a project has to be in the defence and aerospace sector – and indirect offsets, which can be targeted in other business sectors. Exports in car parts, chemicals, radar components and aircraft interiors have been fostered by the arrangement.In this instance, one of these was Eaton Corporation, a North American power management company which also has an aerospace arm. The company subsequently spotted an opportunity to establish a centre to manufacture automotive components in the Czech Republic.
53;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-04-23T16:17:53Z;Honeywell increases full-year guidance;;Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, beat first-quarter earnings estimates and increased its full-year guidance thanks to a recovery in the automotive sector and in demand for automation products.“Our markets stabilised towards the end of last year and now there are signs of improvement”, said David Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer. “Orders are up and that is making us feel good that the industrial economy is recovering.”The comments chime with the latest macroeconomic data showing a gathering recovery in global manufacturing that has benefited other industrial conglomerates, such as Eaton Corp and United Technologies, in the first quarter.The company said that full-year revenues would likely be between $31.5bn and $32.3bn, a modest increase from its forecast at the start of the year of sales of between $31.3bn and $32.2bn.Full-year profits will fall somewhere between $2.30 and $2.45 per share, up from earlier predictions of $2.20 to $2.40 per share, but below analysts’ more optimistic forecasts.“It’s still too soon to assume the early cycle upticks from the first quarter will continue at the same pace,” Mr Anderson said.Nigel Coe, with Deutsche Bank, suggested the company was being conservative with its guidance. “It is clear that Honeywell has given themselves plenty of room for manoeuvre.”Honeywell shares slipped 1 per cent to $47.08 in early trading.Honeywell is best known for its aerospace unit, which makes engines and avionics. The company also makes engine-boosting systems for cars and specialty materials such as advanced fibres and composites.In the three months to the end of March, revenue grew 3 per cent to $7.8bn compared with 2009 but was flat when currency effects are excluded.The transportation segment was particularly strong, booking a 33 per cent rise in sales, and Honeywell also benefited from improved orders in its automations business as customers bought equipment to boost their productivity and output.Aerospace remained a drag. Revenue fell 9 per cent to $2.5bn although Mr Anderson said that the segment was seeing sequential improvements in orders. “That suggests that by the fourth quarter we will see revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.”Net income was broadly flat at $393m, or $0.50 per share, compared with $397, or $0.54 per share, in 2009. Excluding non-cash pension expenses, profits grew 21 per cent to $0.68 per share compared with the first quarter of 2009.During the downturn, Honeywell cut costs sharply as it struggled to meet forecasts. Mr Anderson said that this year the company was looking to rebuild revenues while maintaining cost discipline.“As volumes continue to recover, the leverage off this lower cost base should be considerable,” said Rob Stallard with Macquarie Securities. “As economic fundamentals improve, Honeywell should see steady top line growth and margin expansion.”Mr Anderson highlighted some risks ahead, notably the possibility of raw material cost inflation and the readiness of suppliers to respond to a rapid upturn in volumes.The company is already seeing a shortage of some electronic components he said and has responded by monitoring supply chains more closely and building up inventories of hard-to-obtain materials as “insurance.”
54;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-04-21T16:46:44Z;United Technologies shows sharp rise in profits;;United Technologies, the aerospace and building equipment company, reported a sharp rise in first quarter profits as cost cutting measures dropped through to the bottom line but revenues undershot analyst estimates.Like its industrial peers, UTC has sharply cut costs since 2008 when the economic downturn took hold. It has reduced head count, cut capital expenditures, reduced inventories and sold off under performing businesses.Those measures have begun to filter through to its results. For the three months to the end of March, net income rose 20 per cent to $866m, or $0.93 per share, compared with $722m, or $0.78 per share, the previous year.Analysts had been expecting $0.90 earnings per share and the results ended four consecutive quarters of declining earnings. In early trading on Wednesday UTC shares rose about 1 per cent to $74.71.Greg Hayes, United’s chief financial officer, said that the company had spent almost $1.5bn on restructuring in the last two years but noted that only about two thirds of the savings would be sustainable. The rest will erode as volumes increase.Beneath the headline numbers, UTC’s Carrier and Otis units, which are the world’s largest makers of air conditioning units and elevators respectively, showed solid increases in operating profits and margins.Despite help from favourable foreign exchange rates, revenues fell 1.3 per cent to $12.1bn, below the $12.3bn analysts had forecast. Organic revenues, which exclude currency and acquisition effects, slipped 4 per cent.Mr Hayes pointed to light sales volumes at its fire and security equipment business, at Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft engine maker, and at Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer, for the drop in underlying revenues although he noted the declines were slowing.Louis Chênevert, chairman and chief executive, said that the company was “seeing broader improvement in order trends, especially in the emerging markets. These order trends give us confidence organic growth will resume in the second half of this year.”The comments echo those of Eaton Corp, another industrial conglomerate, which on Wednesday reported strong sales growth thanks to its exposure to the fast growing markets of China and Brazil.The company raised the lower end of its full year earnings guidance. UTC now expects to earn between $4.50 and $4.65 per share in 2010, up between 9 and 13 per cent on the previous year. Revenues will range from $54bn to $55bn.
55;ETN;Eaton Corp;2010-01-25T21:43:45Z;US bank stocks bounce back;;Banking stocks rebounded in early trading on Monday while a rally among steelmakers helped to keep Wall Street in positive territory.Last week, US stocks suffered their biggest weekly loss since October after concerns over Chinese monetary policy and new banking regulations wreaked havoc on the market.The S&P 500 financial index lost 6 per cent after the Obama administration revealed plans to cap the size and trading activity of banks.The sector regained some of its losses on Monday, leading the market higher in early trading. But some of the large banks quickly pared their gains.Bank of America gained 0.5 per cent at $14.98, Citigroup was down 0.6 per cent at $3.23, while Goldman Sachs was 0.6 per cent higher at $154.98.Among regional banks, Privatebancorp surged 18.3 per cent to $11.83 after the Chicago lender reported a smaller than expected loss for the fourth quarter. The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,096.78, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 10,196.86 and the Nasdaq added 0.3 per cent to 2,210.80.Uncertainty over the new banking proposals and Ben Bernanke’s prospects of winning a second term as Federal Reserve chairman continued to weigh on the market.“That’s what the market hates the most: uncertainty,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams. “We were due for a correction but you throw all this in and and it’ll probably be worse than expected now. It’s a shame because the earnings, for the most part, have been pretty good.”Disappointing housing data also held the market back. Sales of previously owned homes in the US dropped at the fastest rate on record last month as buyers pulled back sharply after the expiration of government support.However, a sense of calm also returned to the markets. The Vix index, which tracks market volatility via option prices, slipped 7.6 per cent after surging more than 50 per cent last week.Steelmakers helped to repair the damage on Wall Street.Shares in AK Steel jumped 5.4 per cent to $21.27 after the group posted a higher profit for the fourth quarter than analysts had been expecting. The steel producer said it expected prices for the metal to rise during the current quarter as the economy recovered.The optimism spread to AK’s rivals, lifting US Steel 2.2 per cent to $56.23 and ArcelorMittal 2.2 per cent to $42.50.Intel helped to lift the market in early trading after US weekly financial newspaper Barron’s said the stock could gain more than 25 per cent during the next few years as consumers and businesses replace their computers. The shares rose 2.1 per cent at $20.32.Barron’s also gave a boost to Forest Laboratories, saying the drugmaker’s shares could also gain 25 per cent over the next year due to higher revenues from its latest products: a particularly strong antibiotic and a treatment for constipation. The pharmaceutical company has struggled from generic competition but analysts said the bad news had already been priced into the stock. The shares gained 1.9 per cent to $29.98.In the energy sector, Halliburton fell 0.3 per cent to $31.07 after the oilfield services group reported its fourth-quarter profit had fallen by almost 50 per cent due to lower demand.Eaton, which makes hydraulic equipment, gave a higher profit forecast than analysts had expected for this year. The group said cost-cutting and the anticipated recovery in its automobile division would boost revenues. But after early gains, the shares fell 2 per cent at $64.58.Texas Industries, the largest producer of cement in the southern state, gained 0.9 per cent to $37.57 after announcing that Southeastern Asset Management had raised its stake in the company to 10.8 per cent.Shares in WalMart edged 0.1 per cent lower to $52.88 after the retailer announced it would cut 11,200 jobs at Sam’s Club, its warehouse club division.Brian Cornell, the chain’s chief executive, said most of the jobs lost would be temporary positions in the in-store products demonstrations unit.
56;ETN;Eaton Corp;2009-10-19T20:51:25Z;Wall Street rises on upbeat earnings;;US equities rose on Monday, with the S&P 500 breaking the 1,100 level during the session to hit a one-year high, as optimism about earnings dominated sentiment at the start of a busy week for the release of corporate results.The S&P fell back in late trade to end 0.9 per cent higher at 1,097.91. The last time it traded above 1,100 was in October 2008.“There have been a few misses in terms of revenues, but what the market is focusing on is the fact that most companies have beaten market expectations,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York.Traders are looking for positive news on corporate earnings as a sign that the nascent economic recovery is taking hold. Stocks had priced in fairly rosy expectations, analysts said.The big news of the day was to come in after-hours trade when technology bellwethers Apple and Texas Instruments released their results. Apple shares were 1 per cent higher at $189.86 and Texas Instruments was up 3.4 per cent higher at $23.52 ahead of their earnings reports.Shares of Caterpillar surged 6 per cent to $57.85 ahead of the release of the earnings today for the maker of construction, farming and mining equipment.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday raised its 12-month target on Caterpillar from $52 to $65.RBC Capital Markets on Friday initiated coverage of Caterpillar with a rating of “outperform” and a price target of $65.“We view [Caterpillar] as among the best-positioned companies to benefit from improving global growth and the attendant spending on construction, infrastructure, commodities, and the like,” RBC said.Caterpillar’s rise helped to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent higher to 10,092.19, holding above the psychological level of 10,000 it breached last week for the first time in a year.After an early decline, the Nasdaq recovered and ended up 0.9 per cent at 2,176.32.This week is one of the peak weeks for the third quarter 2009 earnings season, with 13 Dow components and more than 130 S&P 500 companies expected to announce results.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter will fall 22.6 per cent, down from a previous estimate of 24.6 per cent last week at the beginning of earnings season. This is due in part to better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the financial sector.Nonetheless, companies that released earnings on Monday showed some mixed results, initially prompting fluctuation in the large indices.Gannett, publisher of USA Today, reported a 53 per cent decline in third quarter net profit, but exceeded its own expectations on improved advertising spending trends and steep cost cuts. Its shares rose 8.2 per cent at $14.06.Advertising revenues at its publishing division fell 28.4 per cent to $699.6m from last year, which was less severe than the year-on-year declines in the first and second quarters of this year when advertising fell more than 30 per cent.Eaton gained 5.7 per cent to $63.89 after the diversified manufacturing company reported better-than- expected quarterly earnings and boosted its full-year estimate.Hasbro was down 3.7 per cent at $28.42 after the toy maker said its quarterly profit rose 8.8 per cent, which was ahead of the expectations on Wall Street, however, its revenues declined.After the results, Standards and Poor’s upgraded Hasbro to “buy” from “hold”, saying that although revenues of $1.28bn were below their $1.37bn estimate, higher than expected cost reductions meant earnings per share of 99 cents, against 89 cents a year earlier, were in line with their estimate. S&P noted that revenues grew 1 per cent excluding foreign exchange and that improved margins would likely aid results into 2010.BB&T‘s quarterly profit fell more than 50 per cent as the financial company continued to sort through credit issues from the financial crisis. Its shares were down 4.3 per cent at $27.03.
57;ETN;Eaton Corp;2009-02-02T23:59:01Z;Wal-Mart tests diesel-electric trucks;;Wal-Mart is testing hybrid diesel-electric trucks in a step towards extending the energy saving technology to the workhorses of the US road transport system.Chris Sultemeier, head of Wal-Mart’s transport, said on Monday the retailer would operate trucks in different US cities over the coming year, to “determine if these technologies will help reduce our environmental footprint, are viable for our business and provide a return on investment”.The new-generation power systems have been developed by some of the largest US truck, engine and drive-train makers with support from the retailer, which operates one of the largest US truck fleets, with over 6,500 large trucks.The success of Toyota’s Prius passenger car has raised the public profile of hybrid technology. But its use in larger vehicles has been focused on lighter delivery trucks and buses that make frequent stops, rather than on the big class-8 trucks designed for long-distance cruising.Wal-Mart is carrying out off-road tests on a class-8 truck that switches between its electrical drive and its diesel engine, by using electrical power to accelerate to up to 40mph and then shifting to diesel power for cruising at higher speeds.The retailer is also testing five Peterbilt trucks with “hybrid assist” power trains, in which electrical power is used to boost diesel power during acceleration and when climbing hills.Mr Sultemeier said Wal-Mart was targeting fuel savings of 20-25 per cent for the full hybrid model, and 5-10 per cent for the “hybrid-assist” truck. He said he hoped to have a view on the feasibility of the full hybrid model by the summer, after extensive track testing.“If there is a success with the . . . true hybrid vehicle that might be our strategy going forward, versus what I would call the more interim strategy which is the hybrid assist,” he said.Wal-Mart says it has achieved more than a 25 per cent increase in efficiency in its truck fleet over the past three years. It is now seeking to double its fleet efficiency by 2015. The retailer is currently testing trucks powered by reclaimed cooking oil and natural gas.
58;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.
59;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-08-06T17:46:46Z;When some parts don’t fit;;It is rare for Jeffrey Immelt, the urbane and personable head of General Electric, to voice his displeasure at the back-seat chief executives who offer him unsolicited advice on how to run the US conglomerate.But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Immelt found himself railing against the “trading culture” that has spread from Wall Street to corporate America.“People think that running GE is like driving a stagecoach: if horse number three breaks down, take it out and shoot it,” he said during a November 2006 interview. “It is a lousy way to run a company like GE.”Sometimes, though, even chief executives like Mr Immelt have to pull the trigger in shedding a beloved workhorse.GE said last month it would be likely to spin off its consumer and industrial division. A proud part of the company’s heritage – the electric toaster, washing machine and the incandescent light bulb were all invented there – the division’s focus on low-margin businesses turned it into a laggard within the portfolio. And its drag on the company’s overall growth rates had worsened amid the US economy’s slowdown.While GE could have made the investments necessary to revive the division’s prospects, such as expanding a distribution network for selling appliances outside the US, Mr Immelt and his team found more productive uses for that capital in other parts of the company.The dilemma is a familiar one to managers of many of the world’s conglomerates. Showing a knack for making the right calls on what to add or subtract is what defines a conglomerate’s success and is its leaders’ principal duty. Indeed, conglomerates have traditionally been built on the premise that their diverse set of businesses will enable them to outperform less diverse companies.As Chris Zook, head of the global strategy practice at Bain, the management consultancy, says: “Conglomerates tend to have around a third of their divisions in businesses they have no long-term logical reason to be in.”For executives, it is also knowing when to let go that counts. Supplanted long ago by energy, aviation and financial services as the drivers of GE’s profits, the C&I division nonetheless held more than just sentimental value to Mr Immelt and his predecessor, Jack Welch. The businesses made money, reliably churning out cash GE could plough into faster-growing operations or use to fund long-term research projects or finance acquisitions.“The more you want to focus on those businesses and invest in those businesses, the more you look around at the others and say, ‘Hey, does this really fit the profile?’ ’’ says Pam Daley, GE’s senior vice-president of corporate business development. “Then you have to make some tough decisions.”In his seven years at the helm, Mr Immelt has jettisoned more than $50bn in businesses. Gone are insurance, plastics and industrial supply, among others. “This is a 130-year-old company, and it does evolve,” Ms Daley says.Other conglomerates have, too. ITT, an industrial company whose sprawling corporate empire once also included hotel chains and life insurance arms, insists its divisions meet targets on revenue, return on invested capital, per-share earnings and free cash flow. At Textron, whose interests range from golf carts to Cessna corporate jets, each business is measured by its ability to increase its value by 15 per cent annually.“When you have a portfolio as diverse as ours, there is really no other way to compare businesses on an equal footing,” says Stuart Grief, vice-president of strategy and business development. “We use the exact same lens to look at acquisition targets.”Textron screens deals for their ability to capitalise on a list of 11 “megatrends” – sweeping concepts such as economic growth in developing countries, an aging population and limited natural resources. The system puts pressure squarely on divisional managers not only to meet performance objectives but to come up with new ideas.The process can often foster intense competition for resources even among those businesses considered “winners”. At ITT, unit managers present their best ideas to senior executives, who then determine how much the company will invest. “We have more good ideas for good growth than we can afford,” says Steve Loranger, ITT’s chief executive. “We put money on the best bets.”Even if a business has matured to a point where those growth targets are no longer realistic, the unit may still be worth hanging on to, Mr Grief says. “If it’s for cash and we need cash, then that’s value.”Indeed, that free cash flow in turn can be used to fund dividend payments, stock buybacks and, of course, acquisitions. “In some cases, the business is an important talent incubator,” Mr Grief says. “But if [generating cash] is all it is doing, that’s a tough one.”Severing ties to what was once a flagship business can also be gut-wrenching. “It’s never an easy decision,” says Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton.Eleven years ago, Eaton sold what Mr Cutler calls the company’s “mother product line”, its axle and brake business. In the decade that followed, Eaton snapped up 42 companies.Today, those acquisitions contribute more than 70 per cent of Eaton’s revenue. “We don’t believe in the old cash cows,” Mr Cutler says. “People take enormous risks when they say, ‘We’ll hold this cow, and it won’t turn into green cheese.’ ”But the choice of whether to keep or sell a struggling subsidiary is influenced by more than a manager’s assessment of its long-term value. At times investors want more immediate gratification. While the decision to spin off C&I was not prompted by recent pressure on the company to lift its stock price, Ms Daley acknowledges that GE is in the “glare of public scrutiny all the time”.“We do the best we can to balance the long-term interests and the need to keep a healthy dividend, to deliver nice results and get good growth for our shareholders day to day,” she says.Nevertheless, companies such as Loews – a hotels to energy group that describes itself as an “unabashed and proud conglomerate” – tell investors to forget about quarterly earnings.James Tisch, Loews chief executive, says buying and selling to satisfy investors’ craving for quarterly gratification is just bad business. “We worry about long-term value. In a downturn, we don’t feel the pressure to sell poorly-performing businesses,” he says. “Our shareholders know and expect that in a downturn our earnings will go down.”
60;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland.

61;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-07-15T20:49:28Z;Wall Street dominated by volatile trading;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 11,000 for the first time since February 2006 on Tuesday as fears about the financial sector, a dramatic fall in oil prices and news that the SEC planned to limit short-selling played against one another.The volatile day began in typically gloomy fashion with financials under particular pressure after a number of analyst downgrades, a banking-led sell-off in European and Asian markets and some poor results.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, downgraded Wachovia from “perform” to “underperform” slashing her full year 2008 and 2009 estimates and warned that the outlook for equity shareholders was “bleak”.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “The likely need for additional capital to replace expected future losses is putting significant pressure on bank equities broadly . . . In many cases, the equities are down 40-60 per cent over the prior three months. This amounts to a shadow run on several banks.” Still, financials pared early losses as investors bought back into some of the stocks most heavily sold on Monday. By late-
afternoon the sector was down 3 per cent, having bounced off losses of as much as 5.7 per cent.Washington Mutual shares rallied 11.8 per cent to $3.61 after it said it was “well capitalised”. First Horizon, meanwhile, jumped 17 per cent to $5.89 after it reported second-quarter results largely in line with expectations and announced a new chief executive.State Street made ground, rising 7.1 per cent to $59.65 after posting big profit and revenue jumps in the second-quarter.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also pared losses, but only briefly, after Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency would limit short-sales in the shares of the two government-sponsored entities and brokerage firms.The pair slumped 27.3 per cent to $7.07 and 26 per cent to $5.26. Wachovia cut its losses to 7.7 per cent at $9.08 after a spokesperson said it was “fundamentally strong”.Broader markets trimmed losses as oil prices dropped more than $6. The moves helped consumer discretionary stocks to advance in spite of new data showing that retail sales barely budged in June despite the tailwind of massive government rebate stimulus.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3 per cent and led by the likes of Hasbro and General Motors which added 6 per cent to $37.05 and 4.9 per cent to $9.84 respectively. GM also said it would undertake a radical restructuring plan, boosting the stocks.Some deal news also lifted sentiment. Sprint Nextel shares surged 9.4 per cent to $9.04 after reports that South Korea’s SK Telecom was in talks to buy the wireless company.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,214.89 points – its lowest level since November 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,961.80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,215.71 points.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: ”It feels like the craziest day ever . . . The volatility index showed some real fear in the morning. But then oil sold off which calmed some people and brought buyers back into the market.”New data from the Labor Department showed that the cost of raw materials for producers continues to rise although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, moderated somewhat in June. Such costs are clearly taking their toll. Kimberly-Clark issued a profit warning blaming rising energy and distribution costs. The shares fell 6.5 per cent to $55.01.Eaton, the diversified engineering company, also declined 6.8 per cent to $74.47 after the company said 2008 profit would be lower than it previously projected because of rising oil prices. The industrials sector fell 1.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the biggest fallers, following oil prices lower. ExxonMobil dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.19, Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $89.42 ConocoPhillips slid 4.1 per cent to $84.82. The sector has now lost 2.9 per cent over the year to date.Healthcare was the leading gainer and the only sector to hold positive territory consistently, climbing 1.3 per cent thanks to some decent earnings news from Johnson & Johnson and Genentech. The pair rose 1.9 per cent to $67.70 and 5.1 per cent to $79.25 respectively."
62;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-05-19T22:11:03Z;Interest in UK is far from running out of steam;;It is more than 230 years since the British-developed steam engine kicked off the global industrial revolution – and companies such as Spirax-Sarco are still world leaders with steam control systems used across many industries.But the Cheltenham-based specialist is among a dwindling band of UK-quoted engineers – many of which have fallen prey to US takeover in the past decade.Enodis looks set to be the latest to end up in US hands, though the protracted battle for the catering equipment maker took a further twist on Monday as Manitowoc, based in Wisconsin, returned to the table to trump a previously agreed offer from Illinois Tool Works with an offer valuing the company at £1.08bn.Expro International, the oil services company, is the subject of an approach from Halliburton of the US, which could lead to an offer that gazumps an agreed £1.8bn bid including £200m of debt from a Candover-led buy-out consortium.Such deals follow a developing tradition of US groups swooping on UK rivals. In 2004, UTC bought fire protection specialist Kidde for £1.4bn and Danahar beat off US peer Illinois Tool Works to buy printing equipment maker Linx for £85.7m. A year later, filtration specialist Domnick Hunter was bought by Parker Hannifin for £250m after US rival Eaton Corporation withdrew from the ring. In 2006, crash-test dummy and sensor maker First Technology was bought by Honeywell for £290m following a tussle with Danaher.Deals have typically been at substantial premiums – a pattern that has continued, with the competing offers for Enodis pitched at more than double the level of its 52-week low of 124¼p.David Larkam, longstanding analyst of the engineering sector at Arden Partners, blames scant analyst coverage of the dwindling UK market. This, he argues, perpetuates the relatively low valuations of UK engineering companies, some of whose p/e ratios struggle to get into the double figures – making them ripe for opportunistic takeovers.Ulf Henriksson, chief executive of Invensys, one of the UK’s biggest engineering groups, says US takeovers can make sense – especially from a management point of view. While some European and UK engineering companies tend to act more as “holding companies”, US rivals can be more operationally focused, seeking synergies and quick integration of acquired companies, he says.“A major difference is on getting things done and not waiting for tomorrow – making sure things are happening – directness, with not necessarily politeness or niceness.”In return, an acquired UK company, like other European targets, can offer a springboard to global expansion for a US group.“A US company has the scale – but not necessarily expertise – on how to act globally,” Mr Henriksson says. “European companies can relate better to emerging markets – Europeans have a better start here.”So expansive have some of the Britain’s remaining independently owned engineers become that it is hard to describe the likes of Invensys, Charter, Spirax-Sarco and Weir Group as truly British, observers say.“[Many British engineering] companies are international now,” Arden’s Mr Larkam says. “The percentage of business they have in the UK is pretty small.”So does it matter, then, if the numbers of quoted UK engineers are in decline?Although the CBI has no detailed data on what proportion of UK manufacturers is domestically or foreign-owned, the UK has emerged as being relatively successful at attracting foreign investment compared with other European countries, says David Wilkinson, senior policy adviser on manufacturing at the CBI.A fall in the numbers of London-listed companies does not reflect a decline in the strength of British manufacturing and engineering, Mr Wilkinson says.“Britain has achieved manufacturing value-added growth of 31 per cent since 1990,” he says. “People talk about a decline in manufacturing, whereas manufacturing has only declined in its share in national income because of service sector growth. UK manufacturing is not in distress – it’s a growth sector.”
63;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-05-12T21:25:10Z;Chloride rises on hopes of higher offers;;Shares in Chloride soared by more than a third on the prospect of attracting fresh offers, after the power protection group said it had rejected a £657m approach from Emerson Electric Company, its larger US rival.The UK company, the world’s fourth-largest uninterrupted power supply specialist, said on Monday the 255p a share cash approach from Emerson, the world number one, “materially” undervalued the company and its prospects.Chloride’s share price, which was already trading near an all-time high, climbed 72p to 280p on hopes that Emerson would return with a higher offer or that an alternative bidder – most likely Eaton of the US or France’s Schneider – could emerge.Chloride’s closing price gave it a market capitalisation of £709m.Chris Dyett, an analyst at Investec, pointed out that the nearest comparable deal was Schneider Electric’s $6.1bn acquisition of American Power Conversion Corp in 2006, which was priced on 2.5 times sales or a prospective p/e ratio of 36 times.“The sales multiple would suggest a price of 300p and the p/e [would suggest] 270p,” he said. “Either way it’s way above 255p. The reality is that the bidding should start with a three at the front,” he added.Emerson, which was forced to reveal its hand by the Takeover Panel, said there could “be no certainty that an offer would be forthcoming”.The two companies said they had been talking about a combination since March 18, but Chloride has since upgraded its earnings forecasts and the shares are up more than 80 per cent since mid-March, undermining the basis for a deal agreement.Chloride is expecting another year of record sales as companies – from investment banks to oil rigs – rely on a small clutch of specialists to safeguard a growing reliance on technology that demands constant and reliable power supplies.Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy, estimates that the overall market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10 per cent over the next five years.Chloride estimates sales for this year should increase about 30 per cent. It also has deeper exposure to the fast-growing Asian market, particularly India, than rivals.
64;ETN;Eaton Corp;2008-04-14T20:55:05Z;Financials lead Wall St lower;;Wall Street stocks fell on Monday as sagging financial stocks, depressed by news of unexpected first-quarter losses at Wachovia, overshadowed advances in the energy sector.After a downbeat morning session in which the S&P 500 fell as much as 0.5 per cent, markets found some positive momentum on the back of rising commodity prices.An index of energy stocks rose 1.8 per cent led by coal and oil companies.Consol Energy rose 4.8 per cent to $79.27 while Noble climbed 4.7 per cent to $55.25 and ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $79.81.Bad news from the financial sector, and expectations of worse to come, prevailed however, and the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,328.27. The S&P 500 has now fallen for four of the past five sessions.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,275.82 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2 to 12,302.06.Leading the way was Wachovia, which swung from a profit to a loss in the first quarter and took a writedown of $2.8bn. It said it would raise $7bn in capital and slashed its quarterly dividend in response. Shares in the bank tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55.Meanwhile, Federated Investors, the asset manager, said first-quarter earnings rose 10 per cent, but that still missed consensus estimates. Federated slipped 3.2 per cent to $33.09.The news dragged down other financial stocks, including National City and First Horizon, which fell 10.5 per cent to $7.56 and 11.1 per cent to $11.65 respectively.According to Thomson Financial, first-quarter earnings in the financial sector are expected to fall 64 per cent in the first quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Financials are likely to remain in focus as a number of major banks and brokerages, including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, report results towards the end of the week.Analysts have repeatedly cut their earnings expectations for Citi and Merrill, and the pair are predicted to report losses in the first quarter and writedowns of more than $10bn and $7bn respectively.Such results could further damage already fragile confidence in the sector. Financial stocks have now fallen 10 per cent from their highs after the rescue of Bear Stearns.Citigroup shares slid 3.6 per cent to $22.51, Merrill dropped 1.8 per cent to $42.88 while an index of financial stocks lost 2.5 per cent.The earnings season began last week with a lacklustre set of results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, and has continued in that vein.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “Early signs are awful . . . We expect generally disappointing results and a swathe of lowered profit guidance that will drive the S&P 500 lower in coming weeks.”After a downbeat report from United Parcel Service hit markets mid-week, on Friday General Electric delivered the coup de grâce, missing its targets for the first time in five years.GE shares tumbled 12.8 per cent, the most since the crash in 1987, and dragged the S&P to its lowest close in more than a month. GE fell again on Monday, edging down 0.9 per cent to $31.75.Still, pockets of good news helped the industrial sector hold its own. Eaton, the industrial manufacturer, raised its profit target for 2008 after first-quarter earnings beat expectations. It rose 1.4 per cent to $80.03.WW Grainger, the building supplies distributor, beat first-quarter estimates and raised its 2008 earnings forecast, sending its shares up 2.2 per cent to $81.73.Ryder System, the trucking company, also received a boost after it agreed to buy Gator Leasing, a Miami-based rival, for an undisclosed sum. Ryder climbed 2.6 per cent to $62.18.This week should fill out the picture as nine Dow components and 65 S&P 500 companies release results.Deal activity remains a potential bright spot for investors hunkering down for a stormy earnings season. On Monday, Blockbuster said it would take an unsolicited bid of up to $1.4bn for Circuit City Stores directly to shareholders.Circuit City shares jumped as much as 47 per cent before easing back to $4.97, up 27.4 per cent, as analysts questioned the logic of the deal. Blockbuster shares fell 10.2 per cent to $2.81.
65;ETN;Eaton Corp;2007-12-20T10:11:23Z;Doughty Hanson sells Moeller;;Doughty Hanson said on Thursday it had made a threefold return on its equity investment in Moeller.The private equity group invested €192m in the German electrical component maker, which was bought by Eaton Corporation, the diversified US group, €1.55bn.The sale reflects opinion in the private equity market that trade buyers represent the best exit given current market conditions.The disposal is the second Doughty Hanson has made from its Fund IV, which closed to new money in January 2005. With this sale, the fund would have returned to investors €1bn of the original €1.5bn invested. The first sale was of Saft, a French high-end battery maker.Fund IV still has nine investments, including Tumi, the luxury luggage maker, TV3, the Irish television company, and Hellermann Tyton, a cable company.The fund bought Moeller from Advent International, another private equity firm, in September 2005, paying €1.1bn including Moeller’s pension liabilities and debt.Of the fund’s investment, only €192m was equity, and Doughty Hanson said the sale gave it a gross internal rate of return of 54 per cent on that.Moeller makes systems and components for power distribution and automation for use in industrial, infrastructure and residential building.Doughty Hanson said that during the two years it owned Moeller it increased annual revenues from its core businesses by 26 per cent to €960m. It expected revenues in the current year to reach €1bn with earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of €170m.Eaton said the Moeller deal would expand its competitiveness in electrical markets outside the US. It also announced it would launch a $565m tender offer on Friday for Phoenixtec Power, a company listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Phoenixtec makes uninterruptible power supply systems and has leading positions in China, south-east Asia, and eastern Europe.

After its warning earlier this month, the bank delivered a 57 per cent drop in quarterly profits as write-downs linked to subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and fixed-income trading topped $3bn.Citigroup’s third-quarter earnings declined to $2.38bn from $5.51bn a year earlier but the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast. Citigroup had warned that third-quarter earnings would decline 60 per cent.However, the shares fell 3.4 per cent to $46.24 after comments by Gary Crittenden, chief financial officer, unsettled traders. He cautioned that mortgage delinquencies have accelerated and said consumer credit market conditions “will continue to deteriorate”.“The subprime issue is still there,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The market wanted to hear it was over.”Homebuilder stocks traded lower Monday. The S&P homebuilder index fell 4.1 per cent at 429.44.

67;ETN;Eaton Corp;2007-07-16T21:09:31Z;Dow rallies, S&P and Nasdaq down;;Wall Street was mixed on Monday as investors trimmed the market’s early gains and adopted a cautious outlook before this week’s earnings reports.With the exception of blue-chips, stocks turned lower by mid-afternoon. Further weakness in the subprime mortgage derivatives market hurt financial, homebuilding and real estate stocks.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,549.52.Earlier in the day, the broad barometer had set a new intra-day record of 1,555.90 before the rally lapsed. Among the main S&P sectors, telecoms and industrial stocks were firmer, while energy, materials and utilities were in negative territory.The slide in the S&P on Monday was accompanied by a rise in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index, up 2.9 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,697.33 after the benchmark had risen on Monday morning to its highest level since February 2001.Leading the bullish charge on Monday were bluechips. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained in record territory, up 0.3 per cent at 13,950.98. The Dow also set an intra-day record high of 13,989.11. The Dow’s gain for the year of 11.9 per cent now outpaces the Nasdaq’s climb of 11.7 per cent in 2007.Many of the Dow’s 30 components have a strong international presence and the buoyant global economy and weak dollar are expected to boost their quarterly bottom lines.“Companies with higher international exposure are likely to show better earnings growth, which will result in better performance for their stocks,” analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said.The second-quarter reporting season kicks into higher gear on Tuesday, and this week many high-profile companies in the banking, pharmaceuticals and technology sectors will report.Companies whose quarterly results are due on Tuesday include Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Yahoo, Intel and Merrill Lynch.Among groups reporting on Wednesday are Dow constituents United Technologies, which hit a record high of $76.98 on Monday, JPMorgan and Pfizer. Wells Fargo and Ebay are also due on Wednesday.Google, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due to report on Thursday, along with two Dow stocks, IBM – which reached a five- year high of $110.04 on Monday – and Honeywell.Citigroup and Caterpillar, which set a record high of $86.49 on Monday, complete this week’s blue-chip earnings line-up on Friday.With many banks reporting this week, investors are likely to focus on any evidence that problems in the mortgage market are hurting profits.“Continued weakness in mortgage banking, deteriorating credit quality, and a challenging yield curve for most of the quarter make negative earnings surprises more likely than results materially above expectations,” strategists at Barclays Capital said.The S&P financials sector reversed an early rally on Monday and moved back into negative territory for the year to date as mortgage worries flared again.As earnings beckon, technology stocks could extend their strong gains this year. Earlier on Monday, both Apple and Google set record highs on Monday of $139.98 and $558.58 respectively. Analysts at Bespoke noted that technology led other sectors in terms of international sales as a percentage of total sales.“It could be a good quarter for large-cap tech, which explains the performance recently in stocks like Intel and Cisco,” said Bespoke.Citigroup said 2008 consensus earnings estimates for Intel were low and that the chipmaker will “accelerate its current low level of stock buy-back activity”.The bank raised its price target for Intel from $27 to $31.

Mr Bernanke speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due this week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday. Housing starts and consumer prices for June are due on Wednesday. Leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed survey arrive on Thursday, followed by the Fed meeting minutes from last month.

Traders believe some investors have been hurt by the recent rally in stocks and that the pain of losses could push prices higher.Late on Friday, data on short positions, sales of stock by speculators, from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated the largest holding of bearish positions on the S&P since March 2004.The Nasdaq rose 0.2 per cent to close at 2,707 on Friday, its highest level since February 2001.Also this week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due next week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday. Housing starts and consumer prices for June are due on Wednesday. Leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed survey arrive on Thursday, followed by the Fed meeting minutes from last month.
69;ETN;Eaton Corp;2007-07-02T17:19:56Z;The next workshop of the world;;The chief executive of Geekay Polymers, an Indian maker of plastic parts, knew he had a problem. Tiny air bubbles had appeared inside some of K. Kannan’s injection-moulded components, revealing a fault in the manufacturing process that was already annoying an important Japanese customer and posing a threat to Geekay’s expansion plans.Geekay is one of about 40,000 engineering companies, most of them small, in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore – the site of a novel experiment to try to boost the export capabilities of Indian manufacturers.Just why Mr Kannan encountered his manufacturing difficulty – and how he resolved it – sheds light on some of the broader challenges facing India as it attempts to emulate the rapid growth of China as a global manufacturing power.Even after several years of impressive economic expansion, India remains an industry minnow. The country accounted for less than 2 per cent of global manufacturing output last year, as against 13 per cent for China.Even so, in the four years to 2011, India will be the second fastest growing country in the world after China in terms of manufacturing output, according to Global Insight, a US consultancy. It predicts this output expanding at 7 per cent a year.James McGill, head of the Asia-Pacific operations of Eaton, a US maker of industrial and automotive parts, says his company sees “a lot of potential” in India, particularly in fields such as “low-volume” manufacturing where design and ability to react quickly to changes in specification are important.Sajjan Kumar, chief executive of North Carolina-based Sigma Electric, a manufacturer with six plants in India mainly supplying larger businesses in the US and Europe, says: “Because of concerns about such things as China’s political direction, a lot of US businesses are worried about adding to their operations in China. They view India as a good alternative.”To exploit this potential, Tata Consultancy Services, an India-based information technology and business consultancy that is part of the Tata group, India’s biggest industrial conglomerate, has chosen Coimbatore for an experiment in identifying small to mid-sized Indian engineering producers that could step up their operations to become sizeable exporters.The job of TCS managers in the project is to “tutor” some of them in ways to make themselves more valuable to potential customers abroad, for instance by improving their technical quality and being more reliable with deliveries.TCS’s project in Coimbatore – a sprawling city 300km south-west of Bangalore – could become the forerunner of a service the consultancy would offer across India. Its plan is to link small Indian businesses with the companies’ international clients in fields such as automotive and aerospace manufacturing, particularly in the US and western Europe.TCS has identified just over 100 companies in Coimbatore – including Geekay – which it thinks could play a role in making parts and complete engineering products on behalf of its clients. It is also working in a similar way with about 90 companies in two other Indian cities, Pune and Bangalore. These 190 businesses could become a core group of potential suppliers for western companies, and which could be added to later as the service expands, so TCS believes.Geekay is based in a small workshop crammed with injection moulding machines. While most of them sport impressive brand names, almost all were bought second-hand and look slightly the worse for wear, in spite of the attention of Mr Kannan, the company’s founder.With a move into exports (a field in which the company has no experience), Mr Kannan believes he can boost Geekay’s revenues significantly, starting with a 20 per cent increase this year on the company’s sales in 2006 of $160,000.Existing customers include Pricol, an Indian maker of vehicle parts, and the Indian manufacturing operations of Sicame, a French electrical goods supplier.But a potential block to these ambitions is Geekay’s lack of technological expertise, a problem manifested by the mystifying air bubbles that started appearing in the components it had been making for the Indian operations of Mitsuba, a Japanese vehicle parts supplier.“Our parts were being rejected by Mitsuba, and we could not work out what was going wrong,” Mr Kannan says. Eventually a simulation exercise on a computer – in a small laboratory set up by TCS in Coimbatore to help companies such as Geekay improve their operations – linked the fault to the way the company’s moulding machines were being programmed, as a result of which Mr Kannan was able to fix the problem.Another company that TCS is helping is Ammarun Foundries, a maker of cast parts for general engineering and vehicles. The business is based on a large site on the outskirts of Coimbatore and has 500 employees, mostly working with equipment that would be considered outdated in other parts of the industrialised world.N. Visvanathan, Ammarun’s chief executive, recognises that if he wants to become a serious exporter he has to improve the reliability of the company’s processes and that this can only be done with new investments.“If we spent $5m on new equipment, I feel we could increase sales to about $20m by the end of the decade, with 40 per cent coming from exports,” he says. It is possible TCS could help, perhaps by coming up with ideas for a new business plan or introducing Ammarun to new sources of loans.TCS hopes that by the end of the year the companies it is working with might be able to win export orders worth a few million dollars, with its part in fixing up the contracts being rewarded by additional fees from its clients.Assuming the project works well, TCS could extend it to several hundred India-based suppliers for its foreign clients. The prize: a new source of income for TCS as a “supply chain manager” and the chance to boost growth at its big customers as well as India’s network of small suppliers.■Just say no: how a big order can snuff out a small manufacturerA potential problem for Indian manufacturers wishing to step up exports to the US is that they are too eager to get the business.They “are reluctant to say no”, says Pradip Kamat, chief executive of Indus International, a US-based business that facilitates supply links between the two countries.“Some [potential partners from India] are not sufficiently assertive in pushing back against what the US companies are asking them to do,” Mr Kamat says.A company might agree to order schedules that it cannot meet.Partly because of their lack of experience in international business, he says, a lot of Indian companies need guidance on how to frame contracts.Another potential stumbling block is a shortage of skilled people in engineering.“A lot of suitable young people in India are choosing to go into information technology and service industry, not manufacturing,” says K. Ilango, joint managing director of RSM Autokast, a Coimbatore- based manufacturer.As for US businesses that are interested in hooking up with a small Indian supplier, one issue is whether the small group might collapse, according to one US executive who has experience of Indian suppliers.“The finances of a lot of small Indian companies are fairly fragile,” he says. “The easiest way to kill some of them off is to give them a large order which they find it difficult to fulfil.“In the process of tooling up for extra production, they overstretch themselves and can go bust fairly easily.”
70;ETN;Eaton Corp;2007-01-10T20:23:51Z;Wal-Mart to develop hybrid trucks;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is to work with ArvinMeritor, the auto component supplier, on the development of a diesel-electric hybrid truck, as part of its new focus on improving its environmental performance.The companies said in a statement they had agreed to develope a dual-mode, diesel-electric drivetrain for a Class 8 tractor truck - the workhorse of the US long-distance trucking industry.The vehicle will be based on an International ProStar tractor, and powered by an engine developed by Cummins.The FT reported last July that the retailer has been working with Environmental Defense, a not-for-profit environmental group, on applying the technology used by passenger cars such as the Toyota Prius to the ubiquitous tractor unit.Carsten Reinhardt, president of ArvinMeritor’s commercial vehicle business, said the project “holds tremendous promise for the worldwide heavy-duty trucking market in a number of important environmental and economic ways.”The proposed dual-mode units will use electric motors powered by batteries to augment the power of their diesel engines, mainly during acceleration and hill climbing. The batteries are powered by electricity generated by energy created during braking.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, set out ambitious environmental targets for the retailer last year, which included improving the efficiency of Wal-Mart’s fleet of more than 7,000 trucks by 25 per cent by 2008, and then doubling it by 2015.Currently, the Wal-Mart’s company’s fleet averages 6.5 mpg – better than the industry average.This year, the retailer is introducing more fuel-efficient conventional trucks that include aerodynamic side-skirts on its 53ft trailers, better tirestyres and auxiliary power units to reduce engine idling.The improvements are expected to improve fuel efficiency by no more than 13 per cent – with the retailer turning to hybrid power to provide further gains.Prototype and limited production hybrid engines have now been developed for a range of commercial vehicles, including delivery and garbage trucks. But heavy duty 18-wheelers have been seen as less suited to the technology which relies on braking and frequent stops to generate electrical or hydraulic power.Last year, Eaton, a rival of ArvinMeritor, said it had developed a prototype heavy duty truck that has improved fuel efficiency by 5-7 per cent.Heavy duty trucks accounted for around 18 per cent of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2003, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
71;ETN;Eaton Corp;2006-07-18T21:03:19Z;Wal-Mart backs fuel efficiency drive;;Wal-Mart, the retailer that operates one of the largest trucking fleets in the US, is backing the development of a new generation of fuel efficient hybrid truck engines, in a move that could accelerate the adoption of the technology across the industry.The retailer is working with Environmental Defense, a not-for-profit environmental group, on applying the technology used by passenger cars such as the Toyota Prius to the ubiquitous tractor unit that pulls the majority of US road freight.The project is part of a broad push by the retailer to embrace the cause of environmental and social sustainability, as it battles a broad range of US critics on issues ranging from low wages and healthcare to its impact on urban sprawl.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, set out ambitious environmental targets for the retailer last year, which included improving the efficiency of Wal-Mart’s fleet of more than 7,000 trucks by 25 per cent by 2008, and then doubling it by 2015.Currently, the company’s fleet averages 6.5 mpg – better than the industry average.Next year, the retailer will start introducing more fuel-efficient conventional trucks that include aerodynamic side-skirts on its 53ft trailers, better tyres and auxiliary power units to reduce engine idling.The improvements are expected to improve fuel efficiency by no more than 13 per cent – with the retailer turning to hybrid power to provide further gains.Prototype and limited production hybrid engines have now been developed for a range of commercial vehicles, including delivery and garbage trucks. But heavy duty 18-wheelers have been seen as less suited to the technology.Industry observers say they believe Wal-Mart is likely to work with Eaton, a manufacturer of power and drive trains for commercial trucks.The company announced last month it had developed a prototype heavy duty truck that it says has improved fuel efficiency by 5-7 per cent.Eaton has said it is working with truck and engine makers and “select fleets to field prototypes for field evaluation”.Wal-Mart is working on this and other projects with the Environmental Defense Fund, which earlier this month announced it was setting up an office at Wal-Mart’s headquarters in north-west Arkansas to co-ordinate with the retailer.David Yarnold, a vice-president of the group, said Wal-Mart has showed signs of serious commitment on a range of sustainability issues.“If we can move Wal-Mart in the right direction on the environment, it will have a huge impact. It’s like dealing with a country,” he said.
72;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Giants of the road in drive to be green;;The eighteen-wheeler truck, with a 500hp tractor pulling a 53ft long trailer, is the workhorse of the US economy – and the bane of environmentalists.Every day thousands barrel across the US interstate highway system, consuming diesel fuel at the rate of around 6 miles per gallon – compared to around 55mpg of petrol for an, admittedly, far smaller Toyota Prius, the best selling electric hybrid car.In 2003, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, heavy duty trucks accounted for around 15 per cent of of total US greenhouse gas emissions.But now Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is working on making its fleet of over 7,000 trucks just a little more like a four door Prius, supporting the development of the first-ever hybrid system for America’s largest trucks.Brian Wynne, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sees Wal-Mart’s interest as part of a “second wave” of the development of the hybrid power systems that capture and store energy generated by braking, using it to augment engine power.“The commercial applications are following after the technology has being proven in the consumer sector. Now we’ve got commercial fleet operators looking at it, and saying what’s in it for me,” he says.In the past two years, FedEx and UPS, the delivery services, have both developed limited production hybrid electric medium sized trucks to handle urban delivery routes, where the constant starting and stopping is particularly suited to hybrid technology.Prototype hybrid heavy duty garbage and utility trucks have also been produced, demonstrating, says Mr Wynne, that it is easier to make a business case for commercial trucks than it is for passenger cars – with long vehicle usage, and the ability to use stored power for specific work-related purposes. Traditionally the industry has not regarded long-haul heavy duty trucks – built for cruising efficiently at fixed speeds – as potential candidates for hybrid technologies, given their reliance on braking.But Kevin Beaty of Eaton Hybrid Power Systems, which developed hybrid applications for both FedEx and UPS, says his company has concluded from looking at actual driving conditions, that the consensus is wrong. “Just to drive across Iowa, for instance, on Interstate 80, creates lots of opportunity from braking on the downhills. And from just passenger cars entering the freeway, that causes a truck to brake, or to change lanes.”Eaton announced last month that it had developed a prototype hybrid-electric heavy duty tractor that reduced fuel consumption by 5-7 per cent, as well as saving a gallon an hour on supporting the cab while the trucks was parked.It also said it expected to be able to make a heavy duty system available “well before 2010”, estimating that it could save a truck operator $9,500 a year.Hybrid cars deliver far higher fuel efficiency rates of around 50 per cent. But a single heavy duty hybrid truck, driving 100,000 miles a year, would deliver far greater overall reduction in fuel use and emissions.Mr Beaty said the heavy duty system had evolved from work on medium-sized trucks, based in turn on technologies developed for FedEx, working in a project with Environmental Defense, the not-for-profit group that is also working with Wal-Mart.“They really put the pressure on Eaton to move quickly,” he says of FedEx. “And they pulled very hard on demand for product on a timeline …I would safely say they accelerated our work.”He also says FedEx was open about sharing information on its project – something Lee Scott says Wal-Mart will also do as part of its commitment to develop energy efficient technology.Mitch Jackson, head of FedEx’s environmental programmes, says making the technology open to others is aimed at increasing the environmental impact and reducing eventual costs through economies of scale.“We didn’t want to own the technology …we wanted clean vehicles that made economic sense,” he said.

Although only slightly below analyst expectations, they pushed shares in the US’s largest bank down 2.5 per cent to $46.40, its lowest level in four months.Oil prices had their worst day in more than a month, knocking 2.2 per cent off Nymex crude futures. The S&P energy index fell more than 3 per cent. Halliburton fell 4.6 per cent to $35.25 and ConocoPhillips lost 3.4 per cent to $65.15.McDonald’s added 5.1 per cent to $34.72 after reporting a 5.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in June. The restaurant chain also said its second quarter earnings would beat analyst expectations.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent or 1.71 points at 1,234.49, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 0.37 points at 2,037.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, adding 8.01 points to 10,747.36.Industrial output in the US rose more than expected in June, according to the Federal Reserve. Capacity utilisation climbed to 82.4 per cent, its highest level since June 2000.“There was a little bit of back and forth but I don’t think much of anything is going to happen until the CPI numbers [tomorrow],” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, who was nervous about the capacity utilisation index.“The capacity utilisation number is higher than I would have liked and higher than the Fed would have liked.”Toy maker Mattel reported a swing to profit in the second quarter thanks to sales of movie-themed toys. It leapt 10.8 per cent to $17.60, its best day since October 2002.Apple Computer rose 3.4 per cent to $52.37 following an article in the US publication Barron’s that suggested the stock could double on demand for Macintosh computers.Copper prices dipped, after pushing higher for five consecutive days last week. Freeport McMoran lost 5.2 per cent to $51.57, and Phelps Dodge tumbled 3.6 per cent to $76.95.Eaton, maker of electrical systems, reported earnings slightly above expectations. However, investors feared the results were largely the result of a slightly lower tax rate, and the shares fell 4.4 per cent to $65.06.IT services group Computer Sciences fell 3.9 per cent to $50.68, after Jefferies & Co lowered its rating on the stock from “hold” to “underperform”, citing slowing growth.WW Grainger, distributor of maintenance and repair supplies, sank 13.7 per cent to $63.00 in spite of a 15 per cent increase in second quarter profit.

74;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oct 6: Oil leaves bitter taste for Cadbury;;For some time, investors have been wondering when higher oil prices would begin to hurt corporate profits. Well, we have a prime example today after Cadbury Schweppes issued a warning that it would not meet its goal for margins this year. The world’s biggest confectionery company blamed the price of oil and disruption from Hurricane Katrina, which boosted transport costs and the price of PET resin - the basic material for plastic drinking bottles. We will dissect the warning in tomorrow’s paper while Lex is also preparing its view.Hurricane Katrina was the main subject of conversation for Lloyd’s of London, which reported its interim results this morning. In the six months to the end of June, the global insurer increased its profits by 20.6 per cent, but all the attention was on its outlook for the second half of the year. Nick Prettejohn, chief executive, sounded a defiant note by predicting Lloyds will make a profit this year, but Lex reckons Mr Prettejohn has made a brave prediction. The full results announcement can be found here.There have been several new twists to running bid stories. Speculation about a takeover of the London Stock Exchange has taken another turn after it emerged that Macquarie, the Australian investment bank that is considering making an offer for the LSE, has been holding talks about joining forces with Computershare, the financial services and technology provider. However, it is far from clear that the two will even be able to agree on forming a consortium, let alone put together a bid the LSE and its shareholders will want to accept.Meanwhile, the extraordinary tit-for-tat battle for Domnick Hunter, the engineering group, may finally be over after Eaton Corp withdrew its £247.5m bid, clearing the way for Parker Hannifin, its US rival, which has offered 700p, or £251m, to finally claim its prize.National Express confirmed our story, which appeared in this morning’s paper, that it is in talks to buy Alsa, Spain’s largest bus and coach operator. We will be following up with a report on the market’s reaction to the proposed deal, and Martin Dickson is sharpening his pen to opine on the proposed deal for his Lombard column.Finally, there was some slightly better news in the retail sector today as Halfords, the retailer of car and bicycle parts, managed like-for-like sales growth of 2.6 per cent in the six months to September, while Ted Baker, the clothing retailer, pointed to demand in the United States and Asia as it reported double-digit growth in sales and profits.That’s it from me.

75;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-09-21T14:01:16Z;Parker Hannifin raises bid for Domnick Hunter again;;The race to gain control of Domnick Hunter stepped up yet another gear as Parker Hannifin raised its bid for the UK filtration, separation and purification company, beating Eaton’s agreed offer.Parker Hannifin, the US engineering group, increased its bid for Domnick Hunter from 680p per share to 700p, valuing the company at about £251m ($453m).The new offer beats its Ohio-based rival, Eaton’s 690p per share bid, which was agreed on Tuesday by Domnick Hunter.Parker has now increased its bid three times to beat Eaton, which in turn has raised its offer twice.In early August, Parker bid 605p a share for Domnick Hunter but raised its offer to 650p following rumours that an unidentified third party had entered into discussions with the UK company.Two days later on August 26, Eaton emerged as the rival bidder for Domnick Hunter with a 675p per share cash offer. Consequently, Parker increased its bid to 680p a share on September 16, but was again trumped by a 690p a share offer from Eaton on September 20.Wednesday’s offer price represents a premium of about 49.3 per cent to Domnick Hunter’s record share price and a 62.5 per cent premium to its closing price on July 25, the last dealing day before it entered take-over talks.One analyst said: “Parker Hannifin’s immediate response to Eaton’s offer suggests it has a greater appetite for the company. Parker has the management on its side and the funds available to see this through.”But analysts are not ruling out a comeback offer from Eaton. Both Parker and Eaton have had offers recommended by Domnick Hunter’s board and while the US rivals may have different interests in the County Durham-based company, it could fit into either portfolio.“If the bidding does continue, it would edge up by small increases, until one company overstretches itself,” he added.Eaton said it was considering its position following Parker’s renewed bid and said a further announcement would be made in “due course”.Shares in Domnick Hunter edged up 1per cent to 715p in early morning trading.
76;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-09-20T08:22:09Z;Eaton trumps offer for Domnick Hunter, again;;The race to gain control of Domnick Hunter intensified on Tuesday, as the UK filtration, separation and purification company agreed an improved cash offer from Eaton of the US.Eaton, the diversified industrial manufacturer, said it had increased its offer from 675p a share to 690p, valuing Domnick Hunter at £247.5m ($446.7m).The offer beats the latest bid from Parker Hannifin, which raised its offer for Domnick Hunter on Friday from 650p a share to 680p.In early August, Parker bid 605p a share for the company, but saw the deal overshadowed by a counter bid from Eaton, its fellow US-based company.As a result Parker raised its offer to 650 per share, but yet again saw its bid trumped by Eaton.Tuesday’s offer price represents a premium of 60.2 per cent to Domnick Hunter’s closing price on July 25, the last dealing day before it revealed it was in takeover talks.Eaton said under the terms and recommendation of the offer, Domnick Hunter would not pay an interim dividend for the six months ended June 30. The offer will remain open for 14 days.Parker Hannifin said it was considering its position and would make a further announcement in “due course”.Shares in Domnick Hunter were flat at 705½ in early morning trading.
77;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-09-16T09:43:13Z;Domnick Hunter agrees raised offer from Hannifin;;The battle for Domnick Hunter stepped up a gear on Friday after the UK filtration, separation and purification company said it had agreed an improved cash offer from Parker Hannifin that beats US rival Eaton’s bid.Parker Hannifin said it had increased its offer for the UK specialist engineering group to 680p-per-share, valuing the company at £243.9m ($442m).Parker, which first bid 605p-per-share at the beginning of August, raised its initial offer to 650p on August 24. But the group saw its second bid trumped by Eaton, a diversified industrial manufacturer, which offered 675p two days later.Last week Parker Hannifin announced it would set a new deadline of September 22 for Domnick Hunter shareholders to return forms of acceptance after receiving acceptance from about 15 per.The new 680p offer price represents a premium of about 57.8 per cent to Domnick Hunter’s closing price on July 25, the last dealing day before it was revealed it was in talks with Eaton.Eaton said on Friday that it was considering its position and would make an announcement “in due course”.Domnick Hunter shares were down 14¾p, or 2 per cent, at 700p in mid morning trade. Shares in the company have climbed 84.9 per cent over the last 12 months.There has been an increased interest in UK specialist engineering companies from the US, where analysts say organic growth is beginning to stabilise.
78;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-09-13T08:34:55Z;Cobham starts restructuring with fluids sale;;"Cobham, the aerospace and defence group, said on Tuesday it had sold its fluids business for £150m ($273m) and would dispose of its countermeasures business as part of a refocusing on investment and acquisitions in leading technology areas.Announcement of the outcome of a strategic review came as the company unveiled a 15 per cent rise in underlying interim pre-tax profits of £69.6m but a slide of 13 per cent in reported pre-tax profits to £52.5m. Selling and distribution costs, and administrative expenses rose.The market liked the news and Cobham shares rose over 11 per cent to 159p in early London trading.The fluids business has been sold to Eaton of the US and the deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. The group said the sale would be slightly dilutive of 2006 earnings. The bulk of the income would be re-invested in line with the strategic review but £25m would be used to eliminate a pension deficit, it said.Cobham will henceforth have six divisions. Five of these - antennae; defence electronics; air refuelling; life support; and avionics and surveillance - will be tied to key technology areas. The sixth division, services, will include electronic warfare, training, special missions and aircraft operations, and maintenance.The company said it believed the restructuring would increase cross-group collaboration, simplify management, focus research and development expenditure, and improve profit growth. The process of selling the countermeasures business has commenced.The group order book reached a record £1.5bn in the first-half period. Aerospace operating profits edged up 6.3 per cent at £26m. The Chelton antennae business boosted profits 27.6 per cent to £40.8m. The war in Iraq and the threat of terrorism has ensured strong law enforcement and national security markets. Demand for unmanned vehicle microwave systems has exceeded expectations.Flight operations and services saw a fall in profits of 12 per cent to £8.8m, reflecting increased bid activity.Second-half results are expected to be stronger than those for the first half, maintaining the pattern of previous years. Margins for the full year are seen at 15.5 per cent, against 14.4 per cent for the half year.The dividend was raised 10 per cent to 1.01p."
79;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-08-26T14:14:14Z;Eaton tops bid for Domnick Hunter with £242m offer;;In a sign of the growing attractiveness of UK specialist engineering groups, Eaton Corp on entered the race for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration, separation and purification company, with a £242m (€437m) cash bid that pits it against fellow Cleveland-based conglomerate Parker Hannifin.Eaton, a diversified industrial manufacturer, is offering 675p in cash for each Domnick Hunter share. The offer represents a 56.7 per cent premium to the group’s closing price on July 25, when it emerged that an unknown group was in talks regarding a potential bid.Parker Hannifin in early August made a recommended offer for Domnick Hunter of £215.7m, or 605p a share. However, the initial bid was scuppered when an unidentified third party also made an approach, prompting Parker Hannifin to raise its offer to 650p per share.There has been an increased interest in UK niche companies in this sector especially from the US where analysts say organic growth is beginning to stabilise.“US companies have been affected by the weak dollar and are now looking at improving margins by acquiring companies with niche positions and technologies as well as established distribution networks and good balance sheets,” said Gary Murphy, a William de Broe analyst.Eaton’s bid follows United Technologies Corporation, the US-based group’s acquisition of Kidde, the fire protection company, this month for £1.4bn.Mr Murphy said “Parker Hannifin’s offer may drive other speculative bids in the sector.”Alexander Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said any deal would provide his company with “an excellent opportunity to build on our recent initiatives in the filtration sector. Domnick Hunter is a strong business and will add valuable scale and market leadership to our competitive position.”Mr Murphy said Eaton would look to add Domnick Hunter to its portfolio after recently purchasing Heywood group, with similar operations. But this move may mean some restructuring to avoid overlap between the two similar companies. Parker Hannifin, with no companies in this sector may find it easier to integrate Domnick Hunter into its business.Domnick Hunter earlier this month reported a fall in interim pre-tax profit, partly on the back of underperformance in its drug and food filtration unit. Pre-tax profit fell from £6.7m to £6.3m on higher turnover of £84.7mDomnick Hunter’s shares rose nearly 4 per cent to 700p, as analysts suggested that Parker Hannifin was likely to come back with an increased offer.

81;ETN;Eaton Corp;2005-07-18T14:40:30Z;Eaton delivers 30 per cent rise in profits;;Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation unveiled profits ahead of analysts’ expectations, with net earnings per share of $1.37 for the second quarter, up 33 per cent over the same period of 2004.Sales in the quarter rose 18 per cent to $2.83bn. Net income was $209m compared to $161m in 2004, up 30 percent.Earnings in both periods included restructuring charges related to the integration of acquisitions. Before these charges, operating earnings per share in the period were $1.40 versus $1.06 per share in 2004, an increase of 32 percent, and operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 were $214m, up 29 per cent from 2004.“We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which came in above our guidance. Sales growth in the quarter of 18 per cent consisted of 9 per cent from organic growth, 7 per cent from acquisitions, and 2 per cent from exchange rates. Our end markets grew by approximately 7 per cent,” said Alexander Cutler, Eaton chairman and chief executive.He added that the company anticipated net income per share for the third quarter of 2005 of between $1.20 and $1.30. The company increased its full-year guidance for net income per share by 10 cents, to between $5 and $5.20.Second quarter sales of Eaton’s largest segment, Electrical, were $924m, up 33 percent over 2004. Excluding the impact of the Powerware acquisition, second quarter sales were up 11 per cent compared to 2004. Operating profits in the second quarter were $87 million. Operating profits before restructuring charges were $94m, up 47 percent from results in 2004.Mr Cutler said drowth in the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets slowed during the first half of the year. “The commercial aerospace market is starting to accelerate, while defense aerospace is likely to be flat for the full year.Dales in the automotive division dipped 1 per cent to $472m. Automotive production in both NAFTA and Europe was down 1 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2004. Operating profits were $67m, up 3 per cent compared to a year earlier.“The automotive markets held up better than generally expected during the second quarter,” said Mr Cutler. “We are expecting that for 2005 as a whole the markets in NAFTA and Europe will be down approximately 2 per cent.”
82;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;“Hands on” Henriksson takes charge;;The worst kept secret in engineering likely to ended on Thursday when Rick Haythornthwaite formally announced his intention to hand over the reins as chief executive of Invensys to Ulf Henriksson, his chief operating officer.Speculation that Mr Henriksson would eventually succeed Mr Haythornthwaite was triggered by the £2m cash and shares “golden hello” that the 42-year-old Swede received when he joined in May last year from US rival Eaton Corp.Observers believe that his appointment signals a change in direction for the group that has under Mr Haythornthwaite’s stewardship stabilised following the sale of many businesses and a controversial £2.7bn refinancing of the business.One analyst said: “He is there to do a very different job. Rick was there to sort out, or to put it on the straight and narrow so it could be sold off. But he has made a half way house of it, and it is still hamstrung by debt. Ulf is an operations man, he is here to run it and will take out costs.”Those who have met the cool, methodical Mr Henriksson agree that he is as different from Mr Haythornthwaite as is possible. “He’s very hands on, rather than sitting in the office chatting to investment bankers he has been out on the road shouting at people,” said one analyst.But this emphasis on doing the rounds many believe has given him a better grasp of the business than previous chief executives of the diverse engineering group.Before he was lured to a Invensys, Mr Henriksson over saw the hydraulics division at Eaton Corp, and held several senior positions at Honeywell including president of automated control systems.Some measure of Mr Henriksson’s much praised operational abilities could on Thursday be judged by what he has managed to achieve with APV, the process equipment division, where he has reviewed operations and replaced the senior management.His experience in control systems are also expected to prove valuable for the controls division that has suffered from product recalls and weakening performance.
83;ETN;Eaton Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
